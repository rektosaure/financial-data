My name is Claire and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com under the heading News, Events and Presentations until February 1, 2026. A copy of the press release of our third quarter earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials.\nSo before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and speak only as of the date they are made. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even in the event of new information future developments or otherwise.\nAlso, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2025 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financials.\nSo with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc N. Casper\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered an outstanding quarter that included excellent operational performance, reflecting our active management of the company. Strong execution from our team with ongoing focus meaningfully advanced a number of our customer relationships. And we made significant progress advancing our proven growth strategy, which continues to strengthen our foundation and build an even brighter future for our company.\nSo first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $11.12 billion. Our adjusted operating income grew 9% to $2.59 billion. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 100 basis points to 23.3% and we grew adjusted EPS up 10% to $5.79 per share. Our performance in the third quarter enables us to raise our full year guidance.\nNow turning to our end markets. In Pharma and Biotech, we delivered another order of mid-single-digit growth. Performance in the quarter was led by our Bioproduction and Analytical Instruments businesses as well as our research and safety market channel. Turning to academic and government. Revenue declined in the low single digits, representing a modest improvement versus last quarter. To provide some additional context, conditions in the U.S. in this end market were similar to Q2. In Industrial and Applied, revenue grew in the mid-single-digit store in the quarter, representing a nice sequential step up. Performance in the quarter was led by our Electron Microscopy business as well as our research and safety market channel. Finally, in Diagnostics and Healthcare, revenue growth improved over Q2 and though it remained down low single digits for the quarter, largely due to conditions in China.\nHighlights in this quarter included strong growth in our Transplant Diagnostics and Immunodiagnostics businesses. Wrapping up my comments on end markets, our team executed very well to capture the opportunities during the quarter.\nLet me turn to our growth strategy, which consists of three pillars: high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with innovation. It was another excellent quarter for our company. Our new offerings demonstrate our continued leadership and further enable our customers to [indiscernible] scientific breakthroughs, advanced precision medicine and enhance productivity in their labs. In clinical next-gen sequencing, we continue to expand our offerings strengthening our ability to help clinicians and researchers advance targeted care for patients. The Oncomine Dx Express Test on our Ion Torrent Genexus Dx Integrated Sequencer received FDA approval as a companion diagnostic for a targeted therapy used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, and for broader tumor profiling applications.\nWe also introduced the Oncomine Comprehensive Assays+ on the Genexus System providing clinical research labs with an all-in-one comprehensive genomic profiling solution that delivers next-day results. This capability provides clinical researchers with faster, more actionable insights to advance precision medicine.\nFor proteomics, we launched the Olink Target 48 Neurodegeneration panel to advance research into conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Multiple Sclerosis. The new panel helps address the need for reliable detection and measurement of biomarkers that can unlock insights into these and other complex neurological diseases, while also enabling researchers to monitor disease progression and therapeutic responses.\nIn Analytical Instruments, we unveiled two new electron microscopes at the recent Microscopy and Microanalysis Conference. These include the Thermo Scientific Talos 12 transmission electron microscope. This powerful new platform built on our popular Talos line and delivers exceptional image quality and ease of use for structural and cellular analysis and biological research, pathology and drug development. We also introduced the Thermo Scientific Scios 3, focused ion beam scanning electron microscope, engineered with advanced automation, precision and ease of use, this instrument accelerates material science research and supports the development of new materials used across clean energy, aerospace, and digital devices.\nIn Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, we launched Chromeleon 7.4, the first enterprise-ready compliance-focused software platform that unifies chromatography and mass spectrometry workflows. This system offers centralized secure data management and remote access across labs empowering regulated biopharma, clinical and environmental labs to streamline workflows, improve their productivity and accelerate scientific decision-making. This launch is a great enabler for both our mass spec and chromatography instruments.\nLet me give you a quick update on our trusted partner status and our unparalleled commercial engine. We have a unique relationship with our customers. One that has been earned over many years through a relentless focus on anticipating, understanding and meeting their needs. Our trusted partner status provides us with unique insights to guide our strategy and continue to strengthen our capabilities. At the same time, our entry leading commercial engine enables us to deliver those capabilities at scale. I'll share a few highlights of the actions we've taken recently to deliver even greater value to our customers and position our company for the future.\nOne example is our strategic collaboration with OpenAI. The collaboration is focused on two broad areas. The first opportunity is to embed these capabilities into our products and services to make an even bigger impact for our customers. And the second opportunity is to make Thermo Fisher even more productive. As part of this collaboration, we are embedding OpenAI advanced technology into critical areas of our business, including product development, service delivery, customer engagement operations. Our initial focus is on clinical research to help improve the speed and success of drug development, ultimately enabling customers to get medicines to patients faster and more cost effectively. We are deploying these capabilities to improve the cycle time in clinical trials. We'll also look to leverage OpenAI's capabilities to unlock value in our deep repository of data and experience to enable customers to focus on the most promising opportunities in their drug development pipelines.\nTo enable the second focus area, we've launched ChatGPT Enterprise internally across the company to drive productivity, innovation and ultimately, smarter customer engagement. I'm really excited about the ways Thermo Fisher and OpenAI -- two inhibition leaders will work together to make a real difference in advancing science and bringing new medicines to patients.\nAnother good example of our trusted partner status this quarter was the recently announced strategic partnership with AstraZeneca Bioventure hub in Gothenburg, Sweden. This partnership will leverage the combined [indiscernible] of Thermo Fisher in AstraZeneca to drive innovation and strengthen the life sciences ecosystem. A dedicated team from Thermo Fisher will co-locate with AstraZeneca scientists to work on collaborative R&D projects with an initial focus on chromatography, molecular genomics and proteomics. And it was also great to celebrate the grand opening of our Manufacturing Center of Excellence in Mebane North Carolina this quarter. A high-volume, low-cost facility, this site was developed with support from the U.S. government is capable of producing at least 40 million laboratory pipette tips per week to [indiscernible] Life Science Research and Diagnostic Laboratories and adds to the U.S. national supply chain resilience.\nSo wrapping up our growth strategy. This was an excellent quarter, where our actions strengthened our industry leadership today and positions our company for an even brighter future. Moving on now to capital deployment.\nWe also had a very active quarter successfully executing our proven capital deployment strategy, which, as you know, is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In September, we completed our acquisition of our Filtration and Separation business from Solventum, which is now part of our Life Sciences Solutions segment. As you know, this business expands our bioprocessing offering for Pharma and Biotech as well as industrial filtration capabilities. The integration is progressing smoothly, and the early feedback from our customers has been incredibly positive.\nWe also closed our acquisition of the Ridgefield, New Jersey sterile fill-finish site from Sanofi, expanding our U.S. drug product manufacturing. This is an excellent addition to our industry-leading sterile fill-finish network within our Pharma Services business. At this site, we'll continue to manufacture a portfolio of Sanofi's therapies, and we'll invest in additional production lines to meet the growing demand for U.S. manufacturing from our Pharma and Biotech customers as they re-shore more activity to the U.S.\nAlso in the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of our shares. This brings our total repurchases to $3 billion for the year. So overall, a very active quarter for capital deployment. We have a company culture based on continuous improvement through our PPI business system, which once again was a key enabler of outstanding execution. We made great progress in the quarter, leveraging PPI to manage our cost base and deliver very strong earnings growth. The PPI Business System continues to drive great impact, and with the OpenAI collaboration, it will have even more impact going forward. The practical application of AI will enhance our colleagues' ability to find a better way, increasing our productivity and improving the customer experience.\nAs I reflect on the quarter, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished and grateful for their contributions to our success.\nLet me now turn to our guidance. Given our strong performance in the quarter, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for 2025. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks and I'll cover the highlights. We're raising our revenue guidance with a new range of $44.1 billion to $44.5 billion and raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $22.60 to $22.86 per share.\nSo to summarize our key takeaways from Q3. This was a terrific quarter. We delivered excellent operational execution reflecting consistent and active management of the company and the power of the PPI business system, which resulted in outstanding earnings growth. We continue to advance our growth and capital deployment strategies. And we're raising our full year guidance and remain confident in our midterm and long-term outlook and the proven strength of our strategy to create meaningful value for our shareholders and continued success for our company.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company then provide color on our 4 business segments and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2025 guidance.\nBefore I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view of how the third quarter played-out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. In Q3, our team executed really well and delivered results significantly ahead of what we'd assumed at the midpoint of our prior guidance on both the top and bottom line. Q3 reported revenue was approximately $300 million ahead of what we'd included in the midpoint of the prior guide, driven by stronger FX tailwinds, a benefit from our recent acquisitions and a slight beat on organic revenue. The beat on the bottom line was even more significant. We delivered $0.30 of adjusted EPS ahead of what was included in the midpoint of our prior guide for Q3. $0.11 of that beat was from a lower impact of tariffs and related FX than had been assumed in the prior guide. $0.20 of the beat was from very strong operational performance, and this was partially offset by a $0.01 of dilution from the recent acquisitions.\nSo to summarize, in Q3, we once again delivered excellent operational performance. Let me now provide you with some additional details on Q3. Starting with earnings per share. In the quarter, adjusted EPS grew 10% to $5.79. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.27, in line with the prior year quarter. On the top line, Q3 reported revenue grew 5% year-over-year, that included 3% organic revenue growth, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a 1% tailwind from foreign exchange.\nTurning to our organic revenue performance by geography. In Q3, North America grew low single digits. Europe and Asia Pacific both grew mid-single digits, with China declining mid-single digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.59 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin was 23.3%, 100 basis points higher than Q3 last year. The very strong earnings results reflect our active management of the business and the power of our PPI Business System. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 41.9% and 10 basis points higher than Q3 last year. We delivered very strong productivity, which enabled us to fund strategic investments to further advance our industry leadership and offset the impact of tariffs and related FX and unfavorable mix.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.5% of revenue. R&D expense was $346 million in Q3, reflect our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.9% in the quarter. Looking at our results below line. Our Q3 net interest expense was $113 million, as expected, the adjusted tax rate in Q3 was 11% and average diluted shares were $378 million, approximately $5 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution.\nTurning to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $4.4 billion, and free cash flow was $3.3 billion after investing $1 billion of net capital expenditure. Q3 was a very active quarter of capital deployment. We deployed approximately $4 billion of capital through the acquisition from our Filtration and Separation business from Solventum and the sterile fill-finish site from Sanofi. In addition, we repurchased $1 billion of shares during the quarter and returned $160 million of capital through dividends. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.7 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9x on a net debt basis.\nConcluding my comments in our total company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 11.3% reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on our performance of our 4 business segments.\nIn Life Sciences solutions, Q3 reported revenue in this segment increased 8% versus the prior year quarter and organic revenue growth was 5%. Growth in this segment was led by our Bioproduction business, which had another quarter of excellent growth. Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 37.4%, up 200 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q3, we delivered very strong productivity and volume leverage, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix, strategic investments and the impact of the acquisition of our Filtration and Separation business, which is included within this segment.\nIn the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 5% and organic revenue growth of 4%. Growth in the quarter was led by electron microscopy and chromatography and spectrometry businesses. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, down 130 basis points versus the year ago quarter, but this was a sequential improvement from Q2 2025. The majority of the year-over-year margin change was driven by the impact of tariffs and related FX. Outside of that impact, strong productivity was partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable mix.\nTurning to Specialty Diagnostics in Q3 reported revenue grew 4% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 2%. In Q3, growth in this segment was led by Transplant Diagnostics, Immunodiagnostics businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, 150 basis points higher than Q3 2024. During the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume leverage.\nFinally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment reported revenue increased 4% and organic revenue growth was 3%. Growth in the segment was lead by our Research and Safety market channel. The runoff of pandemic-related revenue had a 1% impact on the revenue growth in segment in the quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 12% and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%, 100 basis points higher than Q3 2024. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity which is partially offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments.\nTo change to guidance, as Marc outlined, we're raising our 2025 full year guide on both the top and bottom line, reflecting our continued active management of the company. Let me provide you with the details. We're raising our revenue guidance to an expected range of $44.1 billion to $44.5 billion. Organic revenue growth at the midpoint of the guide continues to be 2% for the full year, and as a reminder, that includes a 1 point of headwind from the run-up of pandemic-related revenue. We're increasing our outlook for adjusted operating margin in 2025 to a new range of 22.7% to 22.8%. And we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $22.60 and to $22.86. The increase in the midpoint of the guidance range reflects $420 million higher revenue than the prior guide, driven by the benefit of our recent acquisitions and an increase in the tailwind from FX.\nFrom an earnings standpoint, the increase in the midpoint of the guide reflects 20 basis points improved adjusted operating margin expansion and $0.20 of higher adjusted EPS. This change includes $0.05 of dilution from the recent acquisitions. We'll continue to actively manage the company and drive excellent operational performance, once again, enabling us to increase our guidance for the year.\nI'll now move on to an update of some of the modeling elements for the full year. Our guidance now includes the impact of the recently closed acquisitions. These deals added $260 million to revenue to our prior full year guide, $20 million adjusted operating income, and as I mentioned earlier, $0.05 of adjusted EPS dilution. In terms of tariffs, our guidance reflects the tariffs that are currently in place as of today. This includes the increase in tariff rates between the U.S. and Europe that occurred since the time of our last guidance. The changes in tariffs and trade policy once again caused intra-quarter volatility in FX rates in Q3. As a result, FX in Q3 was $220 million revenue tailwind to our prior guide and a $0.10 adjusted EPS headwind. So for the full year, we now expect FX to be a year-over-year tailwind to revenue of $230 million and a headwind to adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS of $110 million and $0.37, respectively.\nBelow the line, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $440 million in 2025, and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of 10.5% for the full year. We expect between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion of net capital expenditures and around $7 billion of free cash flow for the year. Then in terms of capital deployment, our guidance now assumes that we deploy $7.6 billion of capital in 2025. $4 billion on the recently closed acquisitions, $3 billion on already completed share buybacks and $600 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. And finally, we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 378 million shares.\nSo to conclude, we delivered an excellent Q3 and we're in a great position to deliver on our 2025 objectives. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Stephen. So with that, let's get started for the Q&A portion of the call.",

After the prepared remarks, you will have the opportunity to ask any questions, which you can do so by pressing star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us.

A copy of the press release of our second quarter earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials. So, before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor Statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nActual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC and available in the Investor Section of our website under the heading Financials, SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2025 earnings and also in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered excellent operational performance in the quarter, reflecting active management of our company and the strength of our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. Our trusted partner status is more relevant than ever and is resonating strongly with our customers. This is allowing us to continue to drive market share gains and highlight our unique ability to enable their success in all market environments. So, turning to the details of Q2, let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 3% to $10.85 billion. Our adjusted operating income grew 1% to $2.38 billion. Q2 adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, and adjusted EPS was $5.36 per share. These results were ahead of our guidance.\nDuring the quarter, our team aggressively mobilized to take the actions to navigate the policy environment and minimize the impact of tariffs for 2025 and beyond. Stephen will provide some more details on our progress. I'll now cover our performance by end market. In pharma and biotech, we delivered mid-single-digit growth this quarter, representing a nice sequential step up. Performance in the quarter was led by our bio production and pharma services businesses, as well as our research and safety market channel. It was also good to realize a sequential improvement in our clinical research business, which delivered slightly positive growth in the quarter. Turning to academic and government, revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter, reflecting some customer hesitancy in a more uncertain environment, resulting in muted demand for equipment and instruments.\nIn industrial and applied, performance played out as we expected, with growth declining in the low single digits during the quarter. In Q2, we delivered good growth in our research and safety market channel. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue declined in the low single digits during the quarter as we navigated headwinds in China. A highlight of the quarter was strong growth in our transplant diagnostic business. Wrapping up on the end markets, our team managed the current environment well, helping us deliver on our financial commitments for the quarter. I'm going to keep my comments a little shorter today so I can leave time to discuss a couple of topics that seem to be on top of mind in the investment community. So, let me give you an update on how we executed our growth strategy in Q2, which drives value creation for our investors.\nAs a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. As you all have heard me share before, we consistently deliver really outstanding innovation, and we have some great launches this quarter. We launched several state-of-the-art solutions at this year's ASMS conference, highlighted by two next-generation Thermo Scientific Orbitrap mass spectrometers, the Astral Zoom and the Excedion Pro. As you know, we're an industry leader in the space, and these cutting-edge analytical instruments will enable researchers to further advance precision medicine and drive significant insights to help pioneer new therapies for complex diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. Customer feedback has been incredibly positive, with one calling the Astral Zoom a paradigm shift for proteomic technology and noting that the Exceedion Pro provides immediate value to their biotechnology work and will serve as their next-generation platform.\nAlso, during the quarter, we launched the Thermo Scientific Krios 5 cryo-transmission electron microscope, which further enhances our leadership in electron microscopy and empowers researchers to uncover critical biological insights and to support the development of new therapeutics. Additionally, we expanded our DynaDrive single-use bioreactor portfolio for bio production, with the first-of-its-kind bench-scale system helping biopharma customers increase workflow efficiencies and seamlessly scale up manufacturing of new therapies. Our trusted partner status, which we built over many years, is another example of why our growth strategy is working and why we're so well positioned for the future. You can clearly see this momentum in our performance with pharma and biotech. Our Accelerated Drug Development solution is a terrific example of how we're delivering great value to our customers.\nAccelerated Drug Development is the integration of our pharma services and clinical research capabilities with the ultimate goal of taking time and cost out of the drug development process. During the quarter, it was great to see the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development validate the power and benefit of our unique capabilities. I'm pleased to state that the customer uptake is very strong, with clinical research authorizations growing strongly in the quarter. Because of the unique relationship we have with our customers, we are partnering with them to tailor how we help them navigate and thrive in the current environment. For some customers, this means expanding US capacity for drug production and supporting their reshoring efforts. For others, it's about accelerating clinical research timelines by aggressively adopting AI into our processes.\nAnd then there are customers where it's all about identifying ways to help them drive productivity. Wrapping up my comments on our growth strategy, we're uniquely positioned to win in this environment. Let me provide a few comments on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our proven capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. As you recall, in February, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Solventum's purification and filtration business. Last month, we amended our agreement to remove Solventum's drinking water filtration business from the transaction, which allowed us to both accelerate the regulatory clearance process and narrow the scope of the acquisition to the business lines most synergistic with Thermo Fisher. We have received all regulatory clearances, and we're on track to close the transaction before year-end.\nWe're excited to welcome our new colleagues to the company and bring the benefits of Solventum purification and filtration technologies to our customers. Then shortly after the quarter closed, we announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with Sanofi to enable additional US drug product manufacturing. Under the agreement, we will acquire Sanofi's sterile fill-finish site in Ridgefield, New Jersey, and continue to manufacture a portfolio of therapies for Sanofi. We will also invest in expanding production at the site to meet the growing demand for US manufacturing capacity from our pharma and biotech customers. This is a great example of the power of our trusted partner status and capital deployment strategy at work. As always, our PPI business system was a key enabler of our strong execution in the quarter and drives competitive advantage for Thermo Fisher.\nWe're leveraging PPI to adjust our supply chains in the tariff environment and to aggressively manage our cost base. We continue to further strengthen the PPI business system by incorporating AI to enhance how we serve customers, streamline internal processes, and reduce cost. PPI is enabling excellent execution today and will continue to do so in the future. So, let me now turn to our guidance. We're increasing our guidance for the full year on the top and bottom line. We now expect revenue in the range of $43.6 billion to 44.2 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $22.22 to 22.84 per share, a $0.23 increase at the midpoint. This reflects continued active management of the business. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. Let me now turn to a couple of questions that seem to be top of mind for investors.\nThe first is, what is our early thinking on the potential impacts of the US policy focus and tariffs on the near-term growth outlook for Thermo Fisher? And second, in that scenario, how are we managing the company to create meaningful shareholder value? Given our strong conviction of the long-term growth drivers of our industry, we thought it'd be most helpful to you if we zoomed in on the nearer term, say the 2026, 2027 timeframe, to focus these questions. We believe that a reasonable assumption is that our end markets will gradually build from the lower growth environment that we're currently navigating. This would lead to a 2026 and 2027 scenario where we will deliver 3% to 6% organic revenue growth. Today, we're currently at the low end of this range, and we believe that our growth will accelerate over the next two years.\nGiven that top-line scenario, here is how we're focused on driving shareholder value creation. First, we'll collaborate even more closely with our customers. As you've heard me say before, our trusted partner status is a meaningful differentiator for us with our customers. They're relying on us to enable their success as they adapt to the environment. Second, we're actively managing the company. You see that in our results and the 2025 financial outlook. Strong cost management was a focus at the beginning of the year, embedded in our original guidance. And we've meaningfully stepped up the action as the year has progressed, adding an additional $300 million of cost reduction since the initial guide. And we will continue that intense focus in 2026 and 2027. This will result in us delivering strong Adjusted operating income growth of mid to high single digits.\nAnd when you factor in our disciplined capital deployment strategy, we have the opportunity to further compound our returns. The final point I want to make is that the long-term drivers of the industry remain very compelling. We expect the environment to improve over the next couple of years, and during that time, we'll deliver very strong earnings growth. When I look to the future, once this near-term scenario plays out, we expect to deliver 7%+ organic revenue growth. So, to summarize our key takeaways from the quarter, we delivered excellent operational performance driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system, beating our guidance and raising our outlook for 2025. Our trusted partner status and proven ability to enable our customer success is a significant competitive advantage. We're actively managing the company in this environment. We're gaining share and driving greater productivity, and cost reduction.\nI remain incredibly confident in the near and long-term outlook for the company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Therman Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, then provide color on our four business segments, and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2025 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view of how the second quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of the last earnings call. In Q2, our team executed really well, and we delivered ahead of what we'd assumed in the midpoint of our prior guidance on both the top and bottom line.\nThis performance reflects very active management of the company, both to minimize the tariff and broader policy impacts and enable the success of our customers. On the top line, Q2 organic revenue growth was approximately $75 million ahead of what we'd included in the prior guidance, driven by sales in China being less impacted by tariffs than had been assumed. In aggregate, the rest of the business performed in line with our expectations, which is an excellent outcome given the macro environment. On the bottom line, we delivered $0.13 of adjusted EPS ahead of what was included in the prior guide for Q2, reflecting excellent operational execution. $0.08 of the beat was from lower impact to tariffs than had been assumed in the prior guide, and $0.05 of the beat was from strong cost management enabled by the PPI business system. Excellent operational performance in Q2.\nLet me now provide you with some additional details on the quarter, starting with earnings per share. In the quarter, adjusted EPS was $5.36. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.28, up 6% from Q2 last year. On the top line, Q2 reported revenue grew 3% year-over-year. The components of our reported revenue growth included 2% organic revenue growth, a slight contribution from acquisitions, and a 1% tailwind from foreign exchange. Within our revenue growth for the quarter, we had a 1% headwind from the runoff of the pandemic-related revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, in Q2, North America and Europe both grew low single digits, and Asia-Pacific declined low single digits, with China declining high single digits.\nWith respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.38 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, an increase of 1% year-over-year. An adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, 40 basis points lower than Q2 last year, and flat sequentially to Q1 2025. In Q2, the year-over-year impact of tariffs and related FX was a 5% headwind to adjusted operating income dollars and a headwind to reported margins in the quarter of 140 basis points. This was partially offset by the rest of the business, which drove 100 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter, demonstrating our ability to drive strong earnings growth in a more muted top-line environment. We delivered very strong productivity, which enabled us to fund strategic investments to further advance our industry leadership and offset the impact of unfavorable mix.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 41.3%, which is 80 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Tariffs and related FX reduced adjusted gross margins by approximately 150 basis points. This was partially offset by 70 basis points of improvement across the rest of the business. Moving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.2% of revenue. R&D expense was $352 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7.4% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line, our Q2 net interest expense was $107 million. As expected, the adjusted tax rate in Q2 was 10%. Average diluted shares were 378 million, 5 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nTurning to free cash flow on the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion, and free cash flow was $1.5 billion after investing $645 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repaid approximately $700 million of senior notes and returned $160 million of capital through dividends. We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.2 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.7 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.3%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments.\nIn life science solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 6% versus the prior year quarter, and organic revenue growth was 4%. Growth in this segment was led by a bioproduction business, which had another quarter of excellent growth. Q2 adjusted operating income for life science solutions increased 6%, and adjusted operating margin was 36.8%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q2, we delivered very strong productivity, which was partially offset by the expected impact of the Olink acquisition, unfavorable mix, and strategic investments. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue declined 3%, and organic growth was 4% lower versus the year-ago quarter. This was driven by the impact of tariffs and the policy focus of the US administration, which is leading to a more muted demand for equipment and instrumentation.\nIn this segment, Q2 adjusted operating income decreased 26%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, down 580 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. The majority of the margin change was driven by the impact of tariffs and related FX. Outside of that impact, strong productivity was more than offset by lower volumes and strategic investments. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q2, reported revenue grew 2% year-over-year, and organic revenue was flat compared to the year-ago quarter. In Q2, growth in this segment was led by a transplant diagnostics business. Q2 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 3%, and adjusted operating margin was 27%, 30 basis points higher than Q2 2024. During the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments.\nFinally, in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment, reported revenue increased 4%, and organic revenue grew 3% versus the prior year quarter. In Q2, growth in this segment was led by a pharma services business and a research and safety market channel. The runoff of pandemic-related revenue had over a 1% impact on the revenue growth in this segment in Q2. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 11%, and adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, 90 basis points higher than Q2 2024. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. So, turning to guidance, as Marc outlined, we're increasing our 2025 full-year guide to reflect the Q2 beat and our continued active management of the company. Let me provide you with the details. We're raising our revenue guidance to an expected range of $43.6 to 44.2 billion.\nOrganic revenue growth is still expected to be in the range of 1% to 3%. We're increasing our outlook for adjusted operating margin in 2025 to a new range of 22.5% to 22.7%. And we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $22.22 to 22.84. The increase of the midpoint of the guidance range reflects $120 million higher revenue than the prior guide, 30 basis points of improved adjusted operating margin, and $0.23 of higher adjusted EPS. This incorporates the Q2 beat as well as an additional $0.10 of adjusted EPS in the second half of the year to reflect additional cost actions we're taking to continue to actively manage our cost base. And it's important to note that our organic outlook for the second half of the year remains on track to the prior guidance.\nThe US-China tariff situation has improved significantly versus our prior guidance assumptions. We reflected the Q2 benefit of that in our revised guidance. Given the fluidity of the tariff and trade policy environment, we thought it was appropriate to keep the tariff impact outlook for the second half unchanged at this point. Should global tariffs remain as they are today, we'll likely have upsides to the new guidance. We're actively managing the company to appropriately navigate the macro environment. Our growth strategy is enabling customer success and driving share gain, and we're using the PPI business system to effectively address tariffs and aggressively manage our cost base. Our initial guide for the year included very strong earnings growth enabled by aggressive cost management, and since then, we've added an additional $300 million of cost actions for 2025.\nThrough PPI, we're constantly finding ways to be more productive and to leverage the scale of the company. This includes increasing the utilization of our shared services and our functional centers of excellence. PPI drives strong earnings growth and also creates room in the P&L to continue to invest for the future. Now move on to an update of some of the modeling elements for the full year. FX rates continue to fluctuate in the quarter, driven by changes in tariffs and trade policy. In Q2, the year-over-year FX impact on revenue improved $660 million versus our prior guide, but the adjusted EPS impact worsened by $0.08, largely due to one-time transactional FX caused by intra-quarter volatility in rates, which, if FX rates stay as they are today, will not reoccur in 2026.\nSo, for the full year, we now expect FX to be a year-over-year tailwind to revenue of $10 million and a headwind to adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS of $18 million and $0.27, respectively. Below the line, we now expect net interest expense to be between $360 and 370 million in 2025, and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of 10.5% for the full year. We continue to expect between $1.4 and 1.7 billion of net capital expenditures in 2025, and free cash flow in the range of $7 to 7.4 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $2 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We continue to estimate the full-year average diluted share count will be between 378 and 379 million shares, and we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends.\nOur guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, so it does not include any impact from the pending acquisitions of Solventum's purification and filtration business and the sterile fill finish site from Sanofi. In terms of phasing for Q3, we expect organic growth in Q3 to be about a point higher than Q2, and adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.10 to 0.15 higher than Q2. And then finally, I wanted to touch on the financial scenario for the next couple of years that Marc outlined earlier. We're managing the company under the assumption that we'll deliver between 3% and 6% organic revenue growth in that period. That includes a continuation of the strong share gains that we've been delivering.\nIn that top-line environment, using the proven levers of the PPI business system, we expect to generate approximately 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and mid to high single-digit adjusted operating income growth. We have a number of exciting opportunities to supplement this organic performance with effective capital deployment. We're very well positioned to continue to drive very strong earnings performance under this level of assumed top-line growth. There are scenarios where we can be above this assumed level of growth, and should this occur, we'll be in a great position to drive even better performance. So, to conclude, we continue to actively manage the company and are effectively navigating the macro environment. Our customers are working on incredibly relevant science to address huge unmet needs in the world, and we're uniquely positioned to enable their success.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Marc.\nThanks, Stephen. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to take a moment to share an update about our leadership team that involves great news for two people whom I hold in very high regard and work very closely with. First, Stephen Williamson, our Chief Financial Officer, has decided to retire next year at the end of March. This was thoughtfully planned on his part, and I know that he and his wife, Jane, are very excited for his upcoming retirement. Stephen has had an extraordinary impact on Thermo Fisher Scientific. Since taking on the CFO role in 2015, he has been instrumental in driving our company's financial performance and strategic growth, and he has built deep relationships with our investors and colleagues. I've had the privilege of working closely with Stephen for nearly 25 years.\nHe's been a true partner, insightful, thoughtful, and always focused on the long-term success of our company. I deeply appreciate his guidance, his unwavering commitment, his steady leadership, and the impact that he has had on our success. While I'll certainly miss him, the entire company is incredibly grateful for his contributions, and we wish him the very best in his well-deserved upcoming retirement. Next, I'm very pleased to share that as part of a long-planned transition, Jim Meyer, currently our Vice President of Financial Operations and member of the company leadership team, will become our Chief Financial Officer effective 1 March 2026. Jim is an accomplished finance leader with deep company knowledge and a strong track record across our organization.\nHe joined Thermo Fisher in 2009 and has held senior finance roles across several of our major businesses, and in his current role, he leads the finance support for all of our operating businesses. Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work closely with Jim. He's exceptionally qualified to take on this role and will continue to drive Thermo Fisher's long-term growth and outstanding financial performance. Stephen and Jim will work together closely over the coming months to ensure a seamless handoff, and I look forward to continuing to partner with them during this transition. With that, I will turn the call over to Raf for questions.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Marc. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question today, please do so now by pressing star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher management team, please limit your time on the call to one question and only one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Our first question today comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats, Stephen, on the retirement, and you guys certainly gave us plenty to talk about in this call. Marc, maybe I'll start with a, maybe I'll start with a high-level one. What you talked about in terms of the new outlook, I think the 7% plus in the long-term sounds like that's the new long-term outlook, the LRP. In the past, you've sort of talked about, \"Here's what the market's going to grow. Here's Thermo taking share above that due to PPI and trusted partner status.\" Could you sort of break that 7% plus down a little bit, give us a little more clarity on that? And then, sort of part of that, you talked about the strong conviction and the long-term drivers of the industry, and sort of how do you arrive at that number? Given everything that's happened in the first half of 2025, the uncertainty we still see in the market, what gives you the conviction that 7% plus is the right number going forward for the long-term?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Mike, thanks for the question. So when I think about trying to create a financial framing scenario, there's been many questions over the last coming months, very appropriate, about what's the growth outlook for the industry, what's the growth outlook for us, what are all the policy impacts, etc. So that's all in the background. And what we wanted to make sure that all of our investors understood is that we're not waiting for anything to happen, right? We're going to actively manage the business and deliver very strong earnings growth. We've been doing that since the second half of 2024. Certainly, it was embedded in our guidance, and as we've highlighted in our remarks, we've been stepping that up to be able to deliver a strong view on the bottom line.\nWhen I think about the scenario that we're in, what we're really assuming in the 3% to 6% is that today we're at the 3% level already, and that as you get the absence of some of the negatives, meaning that academics are not going to keep declining year over year over year, but it will stabilize, even if it returns to zero, you actually get higher and higher in that range. So it's just working through, and the same thing is true in clinical research. When I look at authorizations momentum, this year it's a flattish year in aggregate. That starts to pick up. So without major changes, you're in that range over the next couple of years, right? And so that's the first aspect of it. I'm sure there'll be other analysts who have questions about that.\nBut then we take to the longer term, and you think about the fundamental drivers of the industry. There's a huge need for improved healthcare around the world. The scientific breakthroughs are incredible. When I talk to our biotech and pharmaceutical customer executives, they're incredibly excited about what's in their pipelines and the huge unmet needs that they're going after. And to be able to say in the longer term that we're going to be 7% plus feels very reasonable to us. And we believe in our conviction around our share gain of that 2% to 3% points, right? And so you can kind of back into that would say we're getting to the 4% type market growth feels very reasonable in the longer term, but I'm really focused on the short term right now and delivering just great experience for our customer share gain and great operating income. So hopefully that's growth. So hopefully that's helpful. Thank you, Mike.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Great. And then, Stephen, one for you then. Talking about the margin expansion next couple of years, I think you said 50 to 70 basis points of operating margin per year. That's pretty impressive given the subdued environment. You've already delivered, or you're planning to deliver, a good amount of margin expansion this year, again, in an uncertain market. Can you talk about the levers you have there? How much of it is PPI versus some of the synergies from the business you've brought on, or any particular segment where you're pulling the lever more? Could you just talk about the drivers of that margin gain? Thanks.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Therman Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Mike, actually, just one clarification on Marc's comment. We're talking about clinical research, and you said that business is flat this year and expected to increase going forward. That wasn't authorizations. That's organic revenue growth, and authorizations were very strong in the quarter, and as they were last quarter. Business is in very good shape. So when I think about the 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion, it's about using the same tools in the toolbox from PPI business system, and we keep improving the tools in there, and we've added AI capabilities in as we think about how we manage the company. So it's really about how do we spend the organization energy to use the right levers, and we're not having to invent new things and figure this out. This is all about the same levers that we have, and our team's actually doing that this year. And I think about what we delivered in Q2.\nWe've got, obviously, a significant reported margin headwind from the impact of tariffs and FX, and then underlying, the business is delivering 100 basis points of margin expansion. That's demonstrating how strong that growth is in earnings. And I think about that organic view on earnings growth in the quarter. That was about 6%. So very strong performance in a more muted top-line environment. So we know the right levers, and we're confident in the ability to deliver on that over that two-year period. Thanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Marc, maybe on biopharma, it seems like there's a range of things that are going on right now when it comes to just the investment approaches for these companies. You kind of touched on it, but can you just maybe expand on the extent to which it feels like these spending decisions are being influenced by the macro factors at play? And then if you sort of remove the small biotech segment from the equation, where I understand it's kind of just about how much money you have left in the bank, I'm curious whether there are factors or characteristics that are emerging that sort of divide those that are pulling back in response to the macro versus those that are pushing forward and, in some cases, investing more. Is it pipelines? Is it geography? Is it something else?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. So when I think about pharma and biotech or mid-single-digit growth, we saw broad strength, actually, across all aspects of the business, and that was a nice sequential step up, and actually the best we've seen in nine quarters. So I feel very good about that. Bio production was excellent. Team did a really good job. Strong growth, continuing the trends we saw in Q1. Great bookings growth. Pharma services, very strong growth. Makes sense, right? We talked about the importance of our sterile fill-finish capabilities, the work we do for the clinical trial supply and those things in pharma services. Excellent demand there. Research and safety market channel continues to do well. That's a reflection of sort of what's going on in the research labs at biotech and pharma, and that was a strong performer.\nAs Stephen and I both have said, we turned to positive growth, while only slightly, in the quarter for clinical research. It's actually performing as we expected. Authorization growth, very, very strong. So those things both really well. And when I think about the conversations with our customers, and it may actually be quite surprising to our investors, and whether this is small biotech—I saw a lot of them at the BIO conference that was here in Boston in June—large pharma, some of those companies that are growing super well are those companies that might be managing a challenge. The tone is incredibly positive. And so why is that the case? I think that they have plans on how to navigate the environment.\nI think that as they talk about their pipelines, they feel very good about what's going on in their own pipelines, the understanding of science, and sort of what that bodes for the future. For the larger companies, there's a real confidence that they can work with governments in this environment and navigate it effectively. We actually see it as a lean-in environment for pharma and biotech, and they're leaning on us to make that a reality. We're excited about it, and it continues to be a real driver of our outlook and our current performance.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nOkay. That's helpful and good to hear. Stephen, congrats on my end as well. Looking forward to hearing where that handicap goes from here. How should we be thinking about the analytical instrument business in the back half? Obviously, it's tough out there from a CapEx decision standpoint. Down for this quarter, you have a similar comp next quarter, but then you come up against a really strong Q4 from last year. So I know you don't try to get too specific at the segment level, but just given the moving parts on the hardware side, it would be helpful to know how you see growth there in the back half. Do you think you can finish 2025 with analytical instrumentation being up? Thanks a bunch.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Therman Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Dan, thanks for the comment. So when I think about analytical instruments, we've got decent bookings performance as well. We're talking about a positive book-to-bill. It is most impacted by the more muted conditions in academic and government, and the economy in China. So there's kind of some factors there to wrap into that, and the team's focused on executing and making sure that we're gaining share and getting the most impact from the great innovation that we've been doing across this segment for a number of years. And the new product launches that Marc talked about are a continuation of that.\nSo the team's well-positioned, and it will navigate the situation. And as I said, in my guidance, I continue the assumptions that I had for tariff impact in the second half of the year, and that was a largely pessimistic view on demand in China. And should that not be the case, that will be helpful in terms of the demand in the second half of the year. We'll see how that plays out. Great. Thanks, Dan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGood morning. Stephen, congratulations. Jim, looking forward to working together. For Marc, I wanted to test the pulse on reshoring. How do you think this is going to play out over the medium term? It seems like you're planting some good seeds here with the Sanofi deal to bring business home. Conversely, I'm just curious; like in Q2, did you see any evidence customers could have been pausing purchasing at all? Just the idea being if you're going to buy equipment, you got to know where to send it. Wanted to test out that theory on you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Jack, thanks. There's a heightened level of interest in expanding US manufacturing capacity. You see that in the large pharma announcements. You even see it in our announcement last quarter about expanding our domestic production because leveraging our CDMO capabilities is a very economically effective way as a pharmaceutical customer to reshore capacity, and that really is a lot around the Sanofi transaction. When I think about, does that cause any pause? Not really. Actually, bioproduction is doing really well, and it takes multiple years to bring these facilities online. So it's a one-time added tailwind at some point in the future as facilities are opened or expanded. And then it normalizes, right? Because you don't need to—you don't keep buying more and more equipment. You just expand your capacity at your new site.\nSo I think there's a tailwind that comes up over the next couple of years is the way I would think about it. But I'm not seeing any customers pausing at all in bioproduction, so it's been very positive.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nAwesome. Okay. And then wanted to flip over to analytical instruments, just the organic growth decline this quarter. When you talk about some of the policy pressure, was this all academic, or did you see any of that bleed into pharma, biotech or elsewhere? Could you just talk about that a little bit more?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nOh, yeah. So, Jack, when I think about the analytical instruments business, obviously, the business performed in line with what we were expecting given the academic and government environment and the tariff environment. We actually, I think, actually gained share once again, even in this environment. And why is that the case? Our innovation is unbelievable. If I think about, and I've said this many times for many years, which is if you bring out super relevant products, it doesn't matter what the funding environment is, customers find money. If I think about the order book on Astral Zoom that we launched in June, it's phenomenal, right, in terms of customer interest. I mean, it's super cool, right? And none of them are talking about the funding environment. They're like, \"Wow, this is going to be breakthrough in terms of my research,\" right?\nSo when I think about the environment, until there's more visibility, if you will, to how the budgets play out, I would expect that demand will continue to be muted from academic and government to this customer base. That's what's embedded in our guidance. It's very much in line with what we said before in terms of nothing's changed, and the China headwinds are favorable to what we had said back in April. So it'll take a bit of time until you get more stability in the SEM market, but we're well-positioned to gain share and do a good job serving our customers. Thanks, Jack.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director for Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Stephen, congrats on the long career. Jim, looking forward to working with you as well. So I wanted to follow up on Mike's question regarding those midterm targets in 2026 and 2027. It seems like investors are really most concerned about three key end markets for Thermo: the pharma end market, given MFN and some of the tariff concerns, academic and government, given the funding dynamic under the new administration, and then China. So can you walk us through how are you thinking about those three end markets as we look to this 3% to 6% framework over the next few years? And could you rank order for us which ones of those do you think are most realistic in terms of being pressured or being fully resolved as we come out of this 2026, 2027 timeframe?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, Rachel, when I think about the framing, right, there's nothing super scientific about it being exactly two years. What we wanted to say is that it's a relatively short-term period. It's the environment that we're in now. What are we seeing, and how do we believe it to progress? When you go through, effectively, our assumption is that in this period of time, over the next couple of years, that academic and government goes from a headwind to growth, right? Normally, think about academic and government as a couple percent, 2%, 3% type growth in market, right? It declined mid-single digits in the quarter. That's what we're assuming. We're going to assume a headwind for a while, but what happens is the budgets get set. They don't keep declining. That eventually, in this period, will normalize if you're not expecting a big funding environment to flatten out, right?\nIt's the absence of that headwind effectively happens in this period. Pharma and biotech, actually, just based on the momentum and the authorizations of clinical research, is going to improve. Certainly, that's been our goal all along. We said 2026 is a year of improving growth relative to 2025, and most of the industry has said that. If I look at another large industry participant, they saw very similar trends to what we did, which is authorizations activity was good, seeing some level of growth. So that's the second driver. When I think about China, it's a headwind right now. We expect that if the economy continues to be challenged, it continues to have some headwinds because of the tariff environment. Our expectation is that over this period, it will flatten out. It doesn't mean it won't be better at some point. But right now, in the quarter for us, it was high single-digit decline.\nIt'll take some quarters to work through that, but getting back to sort of a stable at a minimum gets you into that environment. So, as Stephen said, there are clearly scenarios that are better than that, and I'm not smart enough to call exactly how each of these things play out. But I think from our experience, to say that we're operating in this 3% to 6% environment now doesn't take much of a change in sort of what we're seeing to make that a reality. And then whenever that exact quarter is that you're exiting that period, the growth drivers here are very strong, and that's why we said the 7% plus seems to make sense to us.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director for Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. That's helpful. Then I just wanted to dig into the academic and government funding a little bit more and follow up on your answer to Jack's question. So you noted that customers are still finding budgets for your products, which is great to hear, but can you spend a minute talking about what are you hearing from customers and your consultants in DC regarding the funding outlook for NIH this year?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So when I think about what's going on in academic and government, a couple of things. One is, personally, I've been quite active, right, in terms of with our government and in the dialogue, certainly in Congress as well. There remains a high level of bipartisan support for academic and government funding in the life sciences. And there's a very clear understanding of the importance of the life sciences for the health of the US economy and the US's standing in the world. So my belief that you will get to an environment that is meaningfully better than what people are assuming right now seems quite reasonable. It's hard to know exactly what that is, but I don't think something in the flattish type, flat funding environment, wouldn't be out of the question. It might be down a little bit, but I don't think it's going to be that significant ultimately, but we'll see.\nCustomers are cautious, right? They have the dynamic that they have to spend some of the budgets that they have, and they're also planning for what the next year is. So you're going to have some heightened caution until the budget environment is sorted out for 2026. We reflected that in our guidance, right? We're expecting that US academic and government will be soft in the second half of the year. Nothing has changed in our view of that or in terms of the impact, and we'll see how that plays out. Thank you, Rachel.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director for Global Equities, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. I want to maybe just probe back into pharma services for a minute, and I appreciate the call around strong bookings and PPD on track to get back to flat for this year. I guess, Marc, as we think ahead to next year, is there any reason that the CRO business isn't back and more normalized, call it high single-digit growth? And I guess, yeah, has anything changed about the longer-term outlook on that side?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific",
    "content2": "Yeah. I think what we've assumed is a couple of things, and we're not guiding to what next year's numbers are or certainly next year by business line, and the next question for the geography. But more that we're expecting, after just periods of incredible growth in clinical research, that this was a year of tough comparison, which was well-earned, a tough comparison, and that authorizations momentum that we saw starting to pick up in the second half of last year would drive the business back to growth. We're not assuming that right now that it's immediately the high single-digit, but it returns to growth and then builds from there. Long-term, when I think about this business, this is a high single-digit growth business because more work is actually happening in biotech than pharma ultimately in terms of where innovation is. And biotech is 100% dependent on partners to do that work. And so the tailwinds here are very strong, and we are incredibly well-positioned with that customer base.\nAnd so long term, I feel very good about the growth drivers of our clinical research, and nice to return to positive growth this quarter, nice to get great authorizations growth, and setting up for the continued momentum that we would expect in the second half of the year.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director for Global Equities, Jefferies\n\nOkay. And then just follow up, maybe sticking with the services theme. On the CDMO side, the Sanofi deal was an interesting one. I think you've always said asset transfers from pharma are some of the better deals you do. Can you maybe talk about the opportunity set there, how you feel about current capacity and fill-finish today? And then maybe just touch on traction with Accelerator. How many customers do you have today, and how is that going?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So Tycho, in terms of Accelerator drug development, incredibly being adopted, incredibly across the industry. You see that in the pharma services growth. You see that in the authorizations momentum. The Tufts study is a nice study to get a third party's view on it, but what's more important is what are our customers actually buying. They're super excited by it because they partner with us, and now we're really in the how are they operating and how do we make their drug development process more time-effective and more cost-effective so that they can get their important work to the market. That's driving really excellent momentum. In terms of the sterile fill finish and the work there, it's adding a third site to our US footprint. We really like acquiring capacity versus a greenfield because it's a much more cost-effective way of doing it. You have trained operators. You have equipment that's not 100% utilized.\nAnd then we're going to expand on that footprint. So it's great news for the team in New Jersey because they'll be working on even more exciting molecules, and we'll be able to meet the demand, which is very strong with the increased capacity that we have in New Jersey. So it's a really nice acquisition, and we look forward to getting that one closed before the year ends as well. Thank you, Tycho.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Dan, please go ahead.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Stephen, I'll echo the congratulations, and Jim, look forward to working with you. Maybe just one, Marc, to start, just on the 7% plus long-term growth. I think you said the 4% underpinning of market growth feels good to you. I would certainly agree, very doable, but the last three years have been so tough. So maybe a two-parter, just with pharma as your biggest customer, just wondering what type of maybe pharma R&D growth or other kind of factors you would kind of be using in order to support that 4% growth if R&D is a good factor. And I know you talked about the two to three points of share gains. Where do you feel best across your business for those gains?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So when I think about a very long-term perspective of serving pharma and biotech, and I think about the unique capabilities that we bring, we're very well-positioned to continue to drive a very strong share serving that customer base. And we are involved in all of what drives that industry, right? We supply their research labs. We supply their quality control labs.\nWe design their clinical trials. We run their clinical trials. We package and distribute their experimental medicines. We scale up medicines from a concept all the way up through commercial production in small and large molecule. And we benefit from all of those drivers and the trusted partner status that positions us very well. I get lots of questions over the year about what's the aggregate R&D budget or these different things. It's interesting. It's not actually something that is a major driver, but rather it's that holistic support in the industry that we have. So I feel very good about our ability to get very strong growth coming out of our largest end market, and that will drive our long-term growth going forward.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, TD Cowen\n\nAnd then maybe just one follow-up, just on the year. I know you had baked in, or Stephen and Marc had baked in the $400 million headwind for China, and I think there was a $200 million vaccine headwind. Stephen, you talked about how that China reversal, I think, helped the organic growth upside in the quarter. So can you just walk through a little bit how much of China, of that $400 million, came back in Q2? What's still left? And any benefit from the vaccine headwind, or is that still contemplated as a drag? Thank you.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Therman Fisher Scientific\n\nYep. Yeah. So then, so when I think about the tariff dynamic in China, we'd assumed it would be a significant cessation of trade. So we saw that early on in Q2, and there was an impact, and roughly half of the impact didn't happen in Q2. So I think that's up, and that's for the $75 million kind of beat on the top line. You can think about that as kind of the scale of the benefit in Q2. And yeah, so we have an assumption that things basically stay the same as they were in Q2. Things will improve from the guide we've given you. At the end of the day, it's probably about a 25% two-quarter cushion that we have against potential other tariff things that could come up. So I think it's appropriate this time not to change the guidance for that, and we'll see how the tariff environment changes over the next several quarters.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Dan. And so let me wrap up here. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're in a strong position as we enter the second half of the year. We're actively managing the company to continue to deliver differentiated performance, create shareholder value, build an even brighter future for our company. I very much will cherish the upcoming nine months with Stephen, and I look forward to working with Jim on the transition as well. We all look forward to updating you on our third-quarter results in October. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your line."

If you would like to ask a question during today's call, you may do so at any time by pressing star, followed by 1 on your telephone keypad. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the investor section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News, Events, and Presentations until 22 July 2025.

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered very strong performance in the quarter. I'm proud of our team's ongoing focus to enable the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline. Our continued success is the result of our growth strategy, our PPI business system, and our proven capital deployment approach. And, of course, all of this is against the backdrop of a more uncertain macro environment. So, big thanks to the team for their efforts. In my remarks today, I'll first cover Q1, which was a strong quarter with clean execution across all dimensions.\nIn the second part of my remarks, I will cover the expected impact of the uncertainty in the macro environment, and I'll provide a high-level view of our updated guidance for the year that incorporates the expected net impact of current tariffs and the changes driven by the current policy focus of the US administration. So, to turn into Q1, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.36 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.27 billion. Q1 adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, and we grew adjusted EPS by 1% to $5.15 per share. Our team's excellent execution and strong focus on our customer success enabled us to deliver revenue performance ahead of our expectations, and then we translated that revenue performance into earnings that were also ahead of expectations.\nTurning to our performance by end market, as a reminder, there were two less days in the quarter than the same period last year. In pharma and biotech, we delivered low single-digit growth during the quarter, which included a two-point headwind from the runoff of vaccine and therapy-related revenue. Performance in this quarter was led by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses, as well as our research and safety market channel. In academic and government, revenue declined low single digits in the quarter, driven by the macro conditions in the US and China for this end market. In industrial and applied, we grew low single digits during the quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we grew low single digits during the quarter, reflecting strong performance in our healthcare market channel and in our transplant diagnostics, and immunodiagnostics businesses.\nWrapping up on our end markets, while there was more uncertainty than originally expected, our team delivered on our financial commitments for the quarter. In terms of our growth strategy, we made terrific progress in the quarter. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. So, starting with the first pillar of our growth strategy, high-impact innovation. We had an excellent start to the year, launching several outstanding new products that are strengthening our industry leadership by enabling customers to advance their important work. Let me first highlight a couple of new products and analytical instruments that demonstrate our continued market leadership. In electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Vulcan Automated lab, a fully integrated AI-enabled solution that combines robotics and electron microscopy, helping to advance process development and control in semiconductor manufacturing.\nThe Vulcan system speeds up transmission electron microscopy workflows, reduces labor, and delivers consistent, high-quality data. This innovation improves manufacturing yields and enhances productivity and seamlessly connects lab and fabrication operations, a major step forward for our semiconductor customers. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we introduced the next generation Thermo Scientific Transcend, a new ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography platform, helping high-volume laboratories simplify sample preparation and increase efficiency in clinical research, forensic toxicology, food safety, and environmental testing applications, including for PFAS. Turning to our genetic sciences business, we introduced Olink Reveal proteomics kits that enable the identification of proteins related to inflammation and immune response, helping to advance precision medicine. It was a terrific quarter for innovation, and we're excited about the strong pipeline of launches slated for Q2, including those that will debut at ASMS. Our high-impact innovation is enabling an even brighter future for our company.\nDuring the quarter, we also continued to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and deepen our trusted partner status with our customers to accelerate their innovation and enhance their productivity. In our clinical research business, we continued to strengthen our leadership in real-world evidence to help our customers gain insights about the safety and effectiveness of current and future treatments. We launched new CorEvitas patient registries in alopecia and lupus to enhance our customers' ability to inform treatment decisions and ultimately improve patient outcomes. And in electron microscopy, we announced a new collaboration with the Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biological Imaging to advance the understanding of human cells by leveraging cutting-edge cryo-electron tomography technologies. This effort supports the development of the Open Cell Atlas, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at creating high-resolution 3D maps of human cells to drive biological discovery.\nIt's another example of how Thermo Fisher is enabling large-scale collaborative research efforts that push the boundary of science forward. Our trusted partner status and industry-leading commercial capabilities enable our customers' success. They also provide us a unique opportunity for us to engage with our customers, helping them solve current challenges and plan for the future. As always, our PPI business system played a significant role in our success, enabling outstanding execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. PPI is helping us to drive share gain and improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance. It's a significant competitive advantage for Thermo Fisher as we navigate through the current macroeconomic uncertainty. Let me now turn to capital deployment.\nWe continue to successfully execute our proven capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In February, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Solventum's purification and filtration business for $4.1 billion. The business is a leading provider of purification and filtration technologies used in the production of biologics, as well as in medical technologies, and industrial applications. Solventum's innovative products are highly complementary to our leading cell culture media and single-use technologies, broadening our bioproduction capabilities to better serve the high-growth bioprocessing market. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Thermo Fisher. In terms of return of capital, during the quarter, we repurchased $2 billion of shares and increased our dividend by 10%.\nLet me now turn to our guidance. We've all seen a tremendous pace of change in the world since we provided our guidance on 30 January. The two main elements of the macro changes since then are tariffs and the changes driven by the current policy focus of the US administration. As you would expect, we've been operating with agility to assess the changes as they come, and we're actively managing our business to mitigate the impact and capitalize on new opportunities. As a result, we're able to offset a large amount of the impact of the macro changes in 2025 and more fully offset them when the full impact of our mitigation actions is realized next year.\nWhile these recent macro changes are causing uncertainty and remain fluid, we thought it would be most helpful to the investment community to offer our best estimate of the impact of the known changes as of today and embed them in our guidance. Our updated guidance range for the year is revenue in the range of $43.3 to 44.2 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $21.76 to 22.84. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. While the guidance has changed for the expected impact of the macro factors and the mitigating actions, it's important to note that the rest of the guidance remains fully on track relative to what we shared on our last earnings call. As you know, during periods of change, we define a clear set of guiding principles on how to successfully manage the company. These principles have three elements.\nFirst, everything we do starts with our customers and ensuring that we're enabling their success. Second, we inspire our colleagues to bring their best every day to fulfill our mission. And third, we hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard to deliver differentiated short-term performance, all while identifying opportunities to enhance our long-term competitive position, which creates an even brighter future for our company. To enable that differentiated short and long-term performance in this environment, we're leveraging our PPI business system to aggressively manage our supply chain to counteract tariffs and to appropriately manage our cost base. You've heard us talk about our commercial intensity, and we're pivoting our commercial teams to the areas with the best opportunities to accelerate our share gain momentum. We're ensuring that our trusted partner status is driving tangible benefits for our customers.\nOne way we're doing this is by continuing to invest further to strengthen our capabilities for our customers. This includes increasing our investment in US manufacturing, R&D, in the range of about $2 billion. As the largest domestic life sciences player in every major market around the world, we're uniquely positioned to help customers navigate this environment. I'm encouraged by the fact that both our colleagues and our customers have never been more enthusiastic about our company. Our customer allegiance score is at an all-time high, and colleague engagement and retention is incredibly strong. So, to summarize our key takeaways from the quarter, we delivered a very strong quarter driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. Our trusted partner status and proven ability to enable our customer success is a significant competitive advantage.\nLooking ahead, we're acting with speed and agility to navigate the current environment, and we're incredibly well-positioned to minimize the impact and maximize new opportunities, creating an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our Q1 results for the total company, then provide color on our four business segments, and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2025 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view of how that Q1 played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. In Q1, we had another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q1 financials ahead of what we'd assumed in our prior guidance.\nOrganic revenue growth was approximately $100 million or 1% ahead, and adjusted EPS was $0.04 ahead. This was driven by $0.09 of very strong operational performance, partially offset by $0.05 of higher FX headwind, largely due to non-cash transactional FX. So, a clean beat for the quarter. The team's execution was excellent, and we delivered a strong start to the year. Let me now provide you some additional details on our performance, starting with earnings per share. In the quarter, adjusted EPS grew 1% to $5.15. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.98, up 15% from Q1 last year. On the top line, Q1 reported revenue was flat year-over-year. The components of our reported revenue included 1% organic revenue growth, a slight contribution from acquisitions, and a 1% headwind from foreign exchange.\nFor context, within our revenue growth for the quarter, we had a headwind of approximately 3% from the combined impact of two last selling days and the run-off of the pandemic-related revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, in Q1, North America was flat year-over-year. Europe grew low single digits, and Asia-Pacific also grew low single digits, with China declining mid-single digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.27 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, 10 basis points lower than Q1 last year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity. This enabled us to fund strategic investments to further advance our industry leadership and largely offset the impact of unfavorable mix and a headwind from foreign exchange. Total company gross margin in the quarter was 41.7%.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.5% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $342 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 7.5% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line, our Q1 net interest expense was approximately $100 million. The adjusted tax rate was 10%. Average diluted shares were 379 million, five million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to free cash flow in the balance sheet, Q1 cash flow from operations was $720 million, and free cash flow was $370 million after investing $350 million of net capital expenditures. During Q1, we deployed $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders through $2 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January, and approximately $150 million of dividends.\nAlso, during the quarter, as Marc mentioned, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Solventum's purification and filtration business for approximately $4.1 billion in cash. We expect the transaction to be completed by the end of 2025, and the business will become part of our life science solutions segment upon close. We ended the quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and short-term investments and $34.2 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.6x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.4%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now, I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. As a reminder, in Q1, we had two less selling days than the prior year quarter.\nThis impacted revenue growth in each segment by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points. In life science solutions, Q1 reported revenue in this segment increased 2% versus the prior year quarter, and organic revenue growth was also 2%. Growth in this segment was driven by our bioproduction business. Q1 adjusted operating income for life science solutions decreased 1%, and adjusted operating margin was 35.6%, down 120 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q1, we delivered very strong productivity, which was more than offset by the expected impact of the Olink acquisition, unfavorable mix, and strategic investments. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue grew 2% year-over-year, and organic revenue growth was 3%. The growth in the quarter was led by our electron microscopy business.\nIn this segment, Q1 adjusted operating income was flat year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin was 23.2%, down 50 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. In Q1, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through, which was more than offset by strategic investments, foreign exchange headwinds, and unfavorable mix. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q1, reported revenue grew 3% year-over-year, and organic revenue increased 4%. In Q1, growth in this segment was led by our healthcare market channel and our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 3%, and adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, flat year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered good productivity and volume pull-through, which was offset by foreign exchange headwinds and unfavorable mix. Finally, in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue decreased 1% versus the prior year quarter.\nThe run-off of pandemic-related revenue had about a 2% impact on revenue growth in this segment in Q1. This was largely offset by good growth in our pharma services business, and our research and safety market channel. In this segment, Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 2%, and adjusted operating margin was 13%, which was flat to Q1 2024. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which was offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. So, turning to guidance, as Marc outlined, we're updating our 2025 full-year guide to reflect the continued strength of the business, including the very strong start to the year in Q1, and to reflect the expected impact of recent changes in the macroeconomic environment.\nWhile these recent macro changes are causing uncertainty and remain fluid, we thought it would be most helpful to the investment community to offer our best estimate of the impact of the known changes as of today and embed them in our guide. Let me start with a high-level summary of the change to the midpoint of the guide. I'll then provide more detail around each one of the changes so that you have the right context. Adjusted EPS is a dollar lower at the midpoint than our previous guidance. $0.70 is driven by the tariffs between the US and China. We expect this impact will reduce very rapidly next year when the full benefits of our mitigation actions are realized. Non-China-related tariffs are assumed to have no net impact to the adjusted EPS for the full year 2025.\nOur mitigation actions offset the gross impact of the new costs within the year. And finally, the impact of changes driven by the current policy focus of the US administration has a $0.30 impact in 2025. Revenue dollars are unchanged at the midpoint. The volume-related impacts are offset by our mitigating price actions and more favorable FX. And we now expect organic revenue growth to be 2% at the midpoint of the range for the year. The guidance is prepared using tariff rates that are in place today and assumes no change in the current US policy focus. So, we're updating the guide to reflect the change in the macro environment and our highly impactful mitigation actions. It's important to note that all the rest of our guidance remains on track for the year.\nLet me now give you the detailed context behind each of these macro change factors, starting with the US-China tariffs. The tariff rates here are so substantial that they're likely to significantly reduce the volume of trade between the two countries. We expect this will impact the sales of our products in China that are produced by our facilities in the US. In our guidance, we're assuming this is a $400 million revenue headwind for the year. These tariffs are also expected to increase the cost of China-sourced parts and subassemblies. The pull-through on the lower volumes and higher costs, net of the aggressive mitigation actions, is assumed to be a headwind of adjusted operating income in 2025 of $375 million versus our prior guide. The mitigation actions take time to complete, so we don't get all the benefit from them in 2025.\nOnce they are complete, we expect them to fully mitigate the impact of these tariffs. Moving on now to non-China-related tariffs. These recently raised tariffs are increasing our costs, where we directly import items into the US. They'll also likely increase the cost of many items that we buy in the US that have an overseas content. A partial offset to the impact of these tariffs is foreign exchange. The increase in tariffs, of course, is a significant weakening of the US dollar. And at current rates, this increases our revenue guide for the year by $600 million. The bottom line benefit of the FX change is more muted, given the mix of currencies and one-time transactional FX caused by the recent rapid change in the rates. We're driving offsetting mitigation actions here as well, a combination of supply chain changes, actively managing our cost base, and appropriate pricing actions.\nAs a result, as I mentioned earlier, there's no net adjusted EPS impact for 2025 from the non-China-related tariffs. In terms of the changes in US policy focus, the largest impact is likely to be on our US academic and government customers. We now expect their purchases to be more muted in 2025, especially for instruments and equipment, as they evaluate the impact of potential changes to government funding and work out how to access new funding sources to continue their critical work. We're baking into our guidance a lower level of clinical trials work also related to vaccine studies. Net of appropriate cost management, these changes to US policy focus reduce our guidance midpoint by $500 million of revenue, $150 million of operating income, and $0.30 of adjusted EPS.\nThe tariffs and policy changes are also creating some very relevant medium and long-term opportunities, and we're working to maximize these upsides, including leveraging our extensive US manufacturing capabilities to help our customers navigate their own potential tariff impact. This will have minimal impact in 2025, but it's expected to be an important contributor going forward. So, bringing all this together, our updated guidance range for the year now reflects revenue in the range of $43.3 billion to $44.2 billion, organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%, and adjusted operating income margins in the range of 22% to 22.6%. It's worth noting that the tariff-related changes to the guide reduce our adjusted operating income margin by 120 basis points. This is driven by FX and also the tariff costs partially offset by incremental pricing actions.\nWe're taking the right actions in protecting the profit dollars, but it has an impact on our reported margins. Then finally, adjusted EPS in the range of $21.76 to 22.84. This reflects excellent performance in the current conditions. From a range standpoint, we've assumed a ±1% organic revenue growth range around the midpoint. This range is provided to give you a view on the potential outcomes based on the world as it is today and the current tariff levels and the current policy focus areas being unchanged. There are scenarios for 2025 that could be low in this guidance range if the macroeconomic outlook meaningfully dampens, and there are scenarios that could play out above this range that would be largely in line with our original guidance.\nAs I think about the implications for beyond 2025, given the robust mitigation actions we're putting in place, I see the financial impact of these macro-driven changes to our guide reducing fairly rapidly. We'll quickly realize the full benefit of our supply chain actions. Our academic customers will adapt their funding sources and will capitalize on the new opportunities that the macro changes are creating. So now we'll move on to an update to some of the modeling elements for the full year. So given the recent changes in rates, we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind to revenue of $50 million and $90 million headwind to adjusted operating income. This includes an estimated $60 million of one-time transactional FX. In terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a headwind of $0.19 for the year.\nBelow the line, we now expect approximately $330 million of net interest expense in 2025. The adjusted tax rate assumption for the year is expected to be 10.5% versus our prior guide of 11.5%, reflecting the changes to our earnings guidance. We continue to expect between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion of net capital expenditures in 2025 and free cash flow in the range of $7 billion to $7.4 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $2 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We continue to estimate the full-year average diluted share count will be between 378 and 379 million shares, and we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends.\nOur guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, so it does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Solventum's purification and filtration business. Finally, I wanted to touch on phasing for Q2. We expect organic growth in Q2 to be similar to Q1 and adjusted EPS in Q2 to be approximately $0.05 to 0.10 higher than Q1. To conclude, in a more uncertain world, we delivered on our commitments in Q1. While the world is more uncertain, what is unchanged is our approach. We're acting with agility and navigating appropriately, enabling the success of our customers, our colleagues, and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin today's question and answer session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question today, please do so by pressing star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher Management Team, please limit your time on the call to one question and only one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead, Michael.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. And thanks for the detailed comments, Marc and Stephen. That was really helpful. I want to start on something you both touched on, sort of the approach to the guide methodology going forward, given all the uncertainty in the broader market, and especially on the policy side.\nJust trying to think about, obviously, things have changed a lot in the last three months. It feels like they're changing every day, every week. We noticed that for the guide, both for revenues and EPS, you're given a wider range than you have in the past. But just could you talk a little bit about upside, downside, sort of what the world looks like for the lower end versus what the world looks like for the higher end? And just if things keep changing as they have been, what levers do you have to offset things if things deteriorate further, or maybe just sort of what your actions would be if things improve a little bit? Just think about various scenarios going forward. Thanks.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nMike, thanks for the question. Super, super helpful question. So maybe I'll start with a little bit of framing and then think about some scenarios, right? So I think that you start with, we had a really good quarter to start the year, right? And it was clean across all dimensions, top line, bottom line, and execution of the growth strategy. I was actually really excited about customer leads and things that we don't talk about as much, the best ever. Turnover rates of colleagues, the lowest that we've recorded. So things are good, right, from that perspective, right? And the majority of our businesses actually are right on track in terms of what I would expect. The macro, as you said, is quite changing and dynamic.\nIf I think about how challenging it was to just go through and assess what would be the impact on us of just what we have at this moment, we took the view that it is better to actually articulate that so that people can model it, right? And do we think that's going to be exactly right? Of course not. But do we think it's directionally correct? Yeah, we do. And what's hard to visualize is we are fully mobilized on mitigation actions, navigating the environment that we see right now. And if you think about, really, most of these changes started around 10 April, and we sit here less than two weeks later, and we're in full mobilization mode. If things change, we're going to capitalize on opportunities that we never saw coming. We will navigate risks effectively.\nWe'll roll back actions that are unnecessary if some of these things don't happen. So we'll be very agile, and I feel good about our ability to do that. Actually, I think we're incredibly differentiated based on our ability to do that. So what are the broad scenarios? So the upside scenario is changes in the policies between US and China so that you don't have sort of this dramatic reduction of demand based in China for US-made products. It's a small minority of what we produce for China is actually made in the US, but our assumption is effectively it goes to zero until we can mitigate supply chains, which we can do quite aggressively, but this takes some time to move production to other sites. So that's the most obvious scenario that would drive short-term actions.\nThere was actually a good set of commentary from the FDA commissioner about what he's trying to do, and I know the biotech community is all good about those changes, so you could envision a more robust biotech environment. Those are kind of both scenarios. There's probably some other ones I'm not thinking about. The negative is if tariff rates, or other things like that, or the macro gets affected by these things; that'd be the negative scenario. And many levers that we can pull, but it's hard to know exactly what the impact would be because we don't know the magnitude of the challenge that we face. So hopefully that helps you think about it. And the important reminder in a period of volatility: there's no place that's better to be than life science tools, right?\nIn terms of you think about this level of change, and in the scheme of things, very small changes to our outlook. We're still growing nicely, and our plan is to grow EPS, so it's a nice haven in a little bit challenging environment. Thank you, Mike.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nSure. Thanks so much, Marc. That's really helpful. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to touch a little bit on sort of the long-term beyond 2025. I think you guys addressed the tariff situation really well, saying that you'll be able to mitigate things, and it's really not going to be an issue next year. But thinking about NIH, US government funding, policies there, obviously that's an important market. So any thoughts? I know it's really early, but any thoughts on what your view is of the underlying tools market growth rate, that 4% to 6%?\nIs that still viable going forward in the future? Do you think that there will be enough offsets and ability to find new funding sources, or does this sort of dampen that longer-term outlook for the market?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks. Yeah. So, Mike, I think right now we're focused on the super short-term, right? Because obviously we're addressing that. I'm super optimistic about the long-term health of our industry because if you go about what's driving it, right? What's driving it is we're getting older. There's big demand for healthcare, and the scientific breakthroughs, they're awesome, right? The pipelines in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry are compelling, right? And those things generate the fundamental underlying growth. So when I think about the long-term, I feel very good about the long-term growth, right? What underlies that is obviously GDP growth.\nSo if the GDP growth in the world is better, that actually puts an upward pressure on growth. In the long term, if GDP growth is depressed, that puts a downward pressure. That would affect every part of the economy, but that's always a driver that we don't talk so much about. On the academic funding, when I think about sort of US NIH, when you're thinking about a few points of our total revenue, you have a one-time reset if this never changes in policy, but ultimately it grows from there. When I actually think about what is the practical aspects of the government environment or the academic environment, I should say, the next step actually is what does the appropriations happen in the budget? Congress has historically been strong supporters of NIH. We'll see how that plays out. Then from there, it'll go going forward.\nSo hopefully that's helpful. I'm excited for what the future holds. And right now, we're just going to navigate the environment that we're in.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Matt.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and really do appreciate all the detail you've given so far. I guess for my first question, just given how close you are to your customers, as we think about the large biopharma end market, could you maybe talk about any changes in order behavior or patterns where there's been a pull forward of inventories just to get ahead of tariffs? And if you haven't seen that yet, do you expect that to happen? And how do you work with your customers to ensure not a significant amount of supply chain disruption in that event?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Matt, it's a great question, and thanks for it. Given how short the announcement implementation of the tariffs, I don't really believe customers had any opportunity to pull forward, right? It would have been we didn't see something funky in the Q1 in terms of some bolus of things happening later in the quarter. We sort of kind of have the normal process. And the tariffs are in effect. So I don't see really any meaningful changes in the patterns that we're expecting. And so hopefully that's helpful.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Just for my follow-up, when you talk about manufacturing flexibility and the ability to mitigate, could you maybe at a high level just kind of talk about how flexible different types of products are, meaning is it easier to flex an instrument manufacturing facility versus, say, consumables and reagents? And how do you think about sort of the order of priorities in terms of flexing that manufacturing? I just think we all want to get a sense for timing of truly how flexible you can be given the diverse set of products that you offer.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Matt, when you think about what was said in that guide and how fast we were able to mobilize, you can see the short time duration it takes to actually get the full impact of that. And it's complex. It takes a lot of hard work. The team's doing an awesome job of A, thinking about the implications, and then B, putting the right action plans in place, and C, actually executing. So we're at the C stage and executing. And it's different by different businesses, by different product types.\nWe have flexibility in our system that you see the net impact is there. So I think that's the best way to put it. The team's just working with the benefit of the PPI businesses and actually execute on that.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo the other thing that will be challenging, I think, for the analysis of the industry is scale is just an enormous advantage here, right? Because if you're narrow and you ship to the world from a single site for your products, you might be massively disadvantaged. You might be advantaged. It may change your ability to be flexible incredibly hard. We have scale facilities in every major geography. They don't do everything that we do, but the capabilities are robust. We have a lot of twin factories where the factories do the same thing in different geographies.\nSo our ability to move with speed here is enormous. And that actually is a great share gain opportunity for us as well, right? So I feel very good about our competitive position, especially how strong the PPI business system is on our operational execution. And hopefully that's helpful.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks, Marc.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead, Jack. Your line is now open.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. And first, appreciate the very comprehensive guidance update that you guys provided. Marc, one follow-up I wanted to ask on the policy side is related to pharmaceutical tariffs. I was curious what you're hearing from customers, and then just talk about the risks and opportunities there for Thermo Fisher. I'll leave it open-ended, but then have a follow-up.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, Jack, thanks for the question. So we interact obviously with our pharmaceutical and biotech customers continually. Obviously, there's nothing been formalized on the tariffs at this point. And I think there's both advocacy that those customers are doing and planning as well. One of the things that we're doing is we're seeing a lot of interest in leveraging our scale US manufacturing capabilities within our pharma services business. So there's quite a bit of demand for our footprint here. And part of the reason that I talked about the investment, which is a $2 billion investment over the four-year period ahead of us, is really to actually have added capacity for pharma services, for analytical services, or laboratories, and additional R&D done in the US. And I think we just believe that there's going to be more activity here, whether there's tariffs or not, and that's the direction of travel.\nWe're going to enable our customer success. Once again, we'll be able to capitalize on that opportunity to help our customers be extraordinarily successful.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGreat. You kind of walked me to where I wanted to go, which is on the pharma services business. That got a few callouts in the script. We'd just like to get your thoughts on what ending you think this business is now in, kind of in the post-COVID recovery confidence that continues. When you have these discussions with customers, is it more API-related or fill-finish, just like where you're seeing the demand for help?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. It's the biggest area. It's across the board, but the biggest area really is in fill-finish, right? As well as, interestingly enough, drug product on the formulating side of the things as well because there's an interest in having more done in the US, right? So if I say drug product is seen the fastest thing because it takes a long time to move drug substance, actually, in terms of that happening. So I think that's where we'll see it first. And in terms of the COVID thoughts, we've won significant business to backfill the old COVID-related capacity. So that's pretty much all that is actually all signed up. And we're just ramping up production, right? And we have new lines coming in. We're going to have even more lines being added with the additional investments in the coming years. So from that perspective, the COVID's in the rearview mirror, and now you're starting to see the ramp of the activity on what we backfilled with.\nSo it's a pretty exciting time in pharma services.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Jack.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel, please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to dig into the policy changes that drove a portion of the updated guide. You highlighted that $500 million of that guidance reduction was related to those policy changes. You specifically called out the weakness in academics and government, but then you also highlighted some of the clinical trial weakness in light of lower expectations related to vaccines. So could you break down for us what percent of that $500 million update was related to A&G versus the CRO?\nAnd then alongside the academics and government, what are your updated expectations for how that market should perform for the full year?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nWhich market, Rachel? So I understand which market should perform?\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nFor academics and government.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nOkay. Thank you. All right. So in terms of the policy. Yeah. No, thank you. I just wanted to make sure I answered the right question. So thanks for the question. So the split is really quite straightforward on the policy changes. Within the clinical research business, we've seen $200 million of studies canceled or put on hold, specifically vaccine. About half of that is directly funded by the government through innovators, and about half of it is just from the innovators themselves. Every other aspect of clinical trial-related activity seems to be normal. So that's been fine. Actually, there's a lot of interesting strength in the biotech authorization.\nThere's a lot of good things going on there. But we have seen very specific actions, and I suspect that others that do that particular activity in the short term will figure that out. I also believe that ultimately, as the policy people get in place, it's actually good medicine that's actually on some of those studies. So it's just a question of, do they come back, and if so, when? So that's how I think about that. It's kind of a one-off. In terms of the academic and government, it'd be the balance of that. In terms of the phasing, obviously, we don't guide by end market or that. The way I would just think about it is customers are putting in their mitigation actions. We would expect that US academic would be relatively soft the balance of the year.\nThat's what we embedded in our guidance going forward, and that it could improve based on the appropriations dynamics this summer. We haven't assumed that that creates a tailwind, but I would say we just put it in effect right throughout the balance of the year, pretty much pro rata in terms of the impact.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to push on pricing assumptions. So you called out just in light of tariffs that you can see some potential pricing offsets there. So can you walk us through your broad pricing assumptions expectations for this year? How much do you really think you will be able to mitigate? How conservative are you being on those assumptions as well? What businesses are you expecting more pricing power and ability to pass that on through tariffs versus other areas where you maybe take less price in this environment?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. I think it's important to note that we're taking appropriate pricing actions. We're not trying to take advantage of a situation, and this is exactly what we've done in prior times, and appropriately passing price on. When I think about for the year, we were assuming this year we'd add just over a percentage point of price. This is kind of getting to that close to 2%. So it's not a significant price change. It's just appropriate given we're in an inflationary environment given what's happening in the change in the world in terms of tariffs. So that's the approach we're taking. We'll do that appropriately across the portfolio.\nSo there's no area of concentration when I think about that pricing implication.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Rachel.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Doug.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Good morning. Marc, I appreciate your answers to Mike's questions and a few others along the way earlier on essentially the LRP. And listen, I think a lot of us on the line know the history here of biopharma innovation and steady academic funding. That said, this seems different. Thus far, assuming that the White House doesn't really mean it, has not been a good policy. It's clearly not a business-friendly environment right now. Major pharmaceutical companies such as Lilly are publicly talking about reducing the trajectory of R&D and CapEx investment. And then even beyond these recent developments, the reality is it's been a tough five years for the group.\nYou and I have been doing this for a long time, Marc, and I think we believe in the greatness of this industry and the greatness of Thermo. But I'll tell you, a lot of the investors I speak with, if you're newer to the industry, but I don't mean just last year, I mean over the last five years, you've never seen tools be a good group. So with all that in mind, I would think you have to at least contemplate a scenario where the market growth rate is structurally lower. And while what we're doing now isn't normal, it may be normal-ish. In that scenario, what do you change? If the growth rate's lower, do you actually pick up more share than three points? Do you think about altering the portfolio, and how does that impact M&A?\nSo I want to start there, and then I actually want to come back to maybe a more positive question in my follow-up.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific",
    "content2": "So, Doug, I'm smiling. What I would say is if I look at the last five years, there have been aspects of the greatest that this industry has ever been in terms of enabling a global response to the most challenging pandemic that any of us have lived through, and certainly since 1918. And that was only really regional between the US and Europe in terms of the impact. And this industry enabled amazing things. So there are some great things that have happened. And in the five years, there's been some of the greatest innovations that have come out of our industry, let alone. And there's been an incredible overhang from the pandemic that has been extraordinarily painful, right?\nSo I'm very realistic about the ups and downs. But if I look back at the last five years, it basically says the relevance of this industry to have a very bright future and have really quite small movements up or down on the volumes, right? And I think that shouldn't be lost. And when you think about in a period of really, since 30 January, lots of new uncertainty, and in the scheme of life, very small changes to the top line, it talks about the resiliency of our company and actually the attractiveness of the industry, right? And I think that gets lost when there's not been a lot of headlines that are positive right now on some of these dimensions. But as the largest US player and the largest player in the field, with a policy set of actions that want to make the US.\nStronger, we're going to benefit from that disproportionately, and that's a good thing, right? And so I see all of that. When I think about the long term, I know what the drivers are. If GDP growth, right, if you take the views that you have or others are saying that the world's GDP growth is less going forward on a structural basis because of the changes, then the market growth likely will be somewhat less. It'll be much less affected than other parts of the economy. But yeah, if you believe that the world is fundamentally going to grow less, and you can say that's less business policies, whatever it is, then yeah, there'll be some change in growth rates. But if you also say that the US economy is ultimately going to be better positioned, I have no idea whether it will or won't.\nIf you take the bull case, then you could actually articulate that it could actually get better over time. What I do know is Stephen and I have lived our careers through transparency. If our views change on the long-term growth of the markets based on the facts as we see them, we will be the first to say it. We're not hanging on to a number, right? We're just literally putting the numbers that we think are best at this moment in time. We don't look at them every day in terms of long-term, but we look at them periodically. And if our views change, our investors will understand it because we're being candid. So hopefully that's helpful. And I've spent 30 years in this industry. I've lived through every environment.\nI'm pumped for the future, knowing that a lot of the short term is challenging, and we'll get through that just fine.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nAll right. Fantastic perspective, Marc. Thank you for that. Maybe to kind of build into something that might be a little more positive relative to the question I asked, some larger pharmaceutical companies and biotechs, I think most recently this week, Roche, but there have been others. They've started to talk about major build-out of infrastructure in the US. You guys are as close as anybody to your customers. I'm curious what you're seeing in terms of movement towards reshoring in the US and, for that matter, elsewhere in the world. What form do you think this takes for Thermo? If you're starting to hear more about this, where do you think you're going to benefit most? How quickly can this happen?\nIs there any chance that you'd be willing to size up this opportunity for you? I know it doesn't happen tomorrow, but it could be a really important growth driver moving forward.\nYeah. Doug, just like your first question was an important question, the second one is as well. When I actually think of a new facility gets announced, let's forget about the last couple of months. A new manufacturing facility gets announced. It is a meaningful revenue for us in terms of helping many, many, many millions of dollars of equipment, the lab infrastructure, the new consumable supplies, the inventories, but it really is great. I was thinking about a customer last year. Big new facility came online. Huge order, right, in terms of what they do broad-based across bioproduction, bioscience reagents, so on and so forth. Really quite meaningful.\nIn the dialogue we've had with our customers about new facilities that are being discussed, that is really a nice tailwind. We're in the conversation, and we'll certainly help our customers ramp up their capacity. So I think it's a nice tailwind. We don't know how many plants ultimately are going to be built yet, so we'll kind of go one at a time and incorporate it into our guidance as we know it. Just given how long it takes to break ground, it's really 2026 and beyond, but super exciting.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Tycho, please go ahead.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Marc, I want to probe into pharma services a little bit more. Setting aside the $200 million in vaccine cancellations you flagged for PPD, you talked about activity remaining normal, good strength in biotech authorizations. Can you maybe give a little bit more color there? I mean, anything around order growth? Is this mostly share gains from your perspective? How much of this is bundling with Patheon and the combined offering? And then it sounds like you don't really have concerns over pharma cuts in response to tariffs, and in particular around R&D. I just want to make sure that's the case. And then I have one follow-up for Stephen.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo Tycho, given the hour, we'll probably just get to the first one today. But in terms of what's going on in clinical research and sort of how it's performing, actually, the biotech part of the business is quite robust.\nAccelerated drug development, which we announced started to really go announce it late last year and into this year, is incredibly compelling. What does it really mean? I was thinking about trying to how do I visualize this, right? Our biotech customers outsource this work, right, because they are doing one or two studies, whatever it is, or one medicine, right? You're working with CROs. The capabilities and insights we get from our combined suite of capabilities are truly differentiated, which means that we can be faster and more cost-effective. Whether that's letting a customer know that this trial is not going to work out or letting the customer know more quickly that it's going to work out and maximizing their length of exclusivity, these are super compelling things.\nAnd the interest level and the wins here are meaningful, and we're very well positioned in terms of the outlook on clinical research. So I feel very good about what the outlook is there. And the vaccine one was just kind of one-off on the policy changes. What I would also say is that on some of the direction of travel with the FDA on experimenting with less animal studies around monoclonals, that would be the if you wanted to try that out, that's the area where animal models are less relevant. They're trying to modernize, which means anything that the industry has less cost on low value-added activity means that they'll put money where it's going to make a difference. So where we play in the human part of the trials, I feel we're very well positioned.\nOn pharmaceutical companies, how they'll respond to tariffs, they're planning, but I don't know ultimately how they're ultimately going to respond because they're not sure what is going to get implemented. So as we know that, we're going to help them navigate it, and we'll figure out ultimately what does it mean for us. So thank you for the question. Let me wrap up with just a quick comment. First, thanks to everyone for joining us. We're pleased to deliver a strong Q1, and we're very well positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, build an even brighter future for our company. I hope that you value the transparency that we embedded into our guidance, and we'll look forward to updating you on our Q2 results in July.\nAs always, thank you for the support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect your lines."

The Thermo Fisher Scientific Q4 2024 Earnings Call will begin shortly. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2024 Q4 Conference Call. My name is Ezra, and I will be your coordinator today. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us on the call.

While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change.\nTherefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our Q4 and full year 2024 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q4 call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered an excellent finish to 2024 with strong revenue and earnings growth. Our Q4 results continue to highlight the strength of our operational and commercial execution. As I reflect on our performance for the full year, I'm very proud of our team as they continue to enable the success of our customers, and this resulted in meaningful market share gains and strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers. We are incredibly well positioned for the future.\nI'll get into more detail later in my remarks, but first let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue in Q4 grew 5% year over year to $11.4 billion. Our adjusted operating income grew 7% to $2.72 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points to 23.9% and we delivered strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 8% to $6.10 per share in the quarter. Then, in terms of our full year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2024, adjusted operating income was $9.71 billion, and adjusted EPS was $21.86 per share.\nTurning to our performance by end market in the Q4, underlying market conditions played out as we expected and continued to improve. Our team's excellent execution resulted in revenue performance that was ahead of our expectations and we delivered positive revenue growth across all of our end markets. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we grew in the mid-single digits in Q4. This marks the Q4 in a row of sequential improvement for this customer segment.\nPerformance in the quarter was led by our research and safety market channel, pharma services, and bioproduction businesses. For the full year, pharma and biotech declined in the low single digits, which included a mid-single-digit headwind from the runoff of vaccine- and therapy-related revenue. In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits in the quarter and in the low single digits for the full year. In the quarter, we delivered strong growth in chromatography and mass spectrometry and in our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the high single digits during the quarter and low single digits for the full year.\nGrowth in the quarter was highlighted by strong performance in our electron microscopy business and in our research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the low single digits during the quarter and declined low single digits for the full year. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end market was impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing related revenue during the quarter and the full year. The team delivered good core revenue growth highlighted by our transplant diagnostics, immunodiagnostics, and our healthcare market channel.\nThanks to our proven growth strategy and our team's excellent execution, we delivered a strong finish across all of our end markets, continuing to drive meaningful share gain. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine.\nAs you know, our growth strategy really resonates with our customers, and throughout the year we have continuously strengthened our company to be even more relevant for the future. Let me give you some highlights starting with the first pillar. We had another really terrific year of high impact innovation.\nThroughout 2024 we launched outstanding products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work in chromatography and mass spectrometry this year it was highlighted by the launch of our Thermo Scientific Stellar Mass Spectrometer, which complements our award-winning Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral launched in 2023. By validating biomarker candidates of interest to advance clinical research, it's been great to see the significant impact these two mass spectrometers are having on advancing science.\nWe also launched the Thermo Scientific Dionex Inuvion Ion Chromatography System which streamlines environmental testing in industrial and applied settings, helping our customers identify contaminants more efficiently. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Iliad Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope which integrates a number of advanced analytical technologies into a seamless and user-friendly workflow to enable the development of advanced materials.\nIn our biosciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems MagMAX Sequential DNA/RNA Kit which maximizes the isolation of DNA and RNA from blood cancer samples, helping researchers identify unique insights into cancer-causing genetic alterations, and in bioproduction, we launched a first of its kind bio-based film for our single-use technologies. Developed with plant-based material rather than fossil fuel materials, this innovative film provides lower carbon solutions for the production of biologics. We continued this great innovation momentum in Q4.\nIn chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the Thermo Scientific iCAP MX Series ICP-MS, an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry platform designed to streamline trace elemental analysis for environmental, food, industrial, and research laboratories. In life science solutions, we introduced new additions to the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads platform to further enhance the development and manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. Another year of innovation that was spectacular and we have an exciting pipeline for the future as well.\nIn 2024 we also continue to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and deepen our trusted partner status with customers to accelerate their innovation and enhance their productivity. Throughout the year we expanded our capabilities to meet our customers' current and future needs.\nThis included expanding our pharma services and clinical research capabilities in the US and Europe to be an even stronger partner for our pharma and biotech customers. In Q4 we introduced our Accelerator Drug Development Solution. This truly unique offering leverages our combined CDMO and CRO capabilities to enable our customers to move their critical drug development programs forward with speed, quality, and efficiency, helping to improve their return on their R&D investments. This is a huge value add for our customers and not something they can do alone or with our competitors.\nCustomer feedback has been incredibly positive. We're winning new business and we're excited about the future impact of our accelerated drug development capabilities. We also made significant advancements in partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year.\nThis included our partnership with the National Cancer Institute on the myeloMATCH, precision medicine umbrella trial, which we announced in July, and then the FDA approval for Ion Torrent Oncomine Dx Target Test. That's another example of our customer partnerships. This is a next generation sequencing based assay to be used as a companion diagnostic for Servier's first treatment for patients living with glioma, a type of brain cancer. Finally, during the Q4 we entered into a partnership with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to establish the Thermo Fisher Scientific Center of Excellence for Proteomics there.\nThese partnerships demonstrate how close we are working with our customers to enable their success and drive meaningful impact for patients. As you can see, it was another excellent year of advancing our growth strategy. As always, our PPI Business System continued to enable outstanding execution throughout the year.\nPPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. PPI is helping us to drive share gain, and improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance. We're also benefiting from the application of generative AI into our PPI business system. Our colleagues around the world are actively deploying GenAI, finding new ways to improve the customer experience, streamline internal processes, and enhance our products and services. Not only did PPI contribute to our excellent financial results, it's also helping our team to find new ways to enable our customer success, ensuring a very bright future for our company.\nTurning to capital deployment, we continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy to create tremendous value. We do this through a combination of strategic M&A and substantial return of capital to our shareholders.\nIn 2024 we returned $4.6 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, including repurchasing $1 billion of shares in Q4. In terms of M&A during the year we completed our acquisition of Olink, a leading provider of advanced solutions for proteomics research. Olink is now our proteomics science business. The integration is progressing smoothly, and just after quarter end our Olink technology was selected by the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project to support the world's largest human proteomics study of its kind. The latest validation of the value of our capabilities.\nWhen I think about our disciplined approach to M&A and our unparalleled track record, it's all about long-term value creation for our shareholders. We just celebrated the two-year anniversary of the acquisition of the Binding Site, now our protein diagnostics business.\nThis business performed incredibly well again in 2024, delivering low-teens growth, launching new products, and driving a great return on investment. This is a recent example of the impact of our proven capital deployment strategy in action. Let me now give you a brief update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet.\nI'm proud of the actions we took in 2024 in this regard. We made meaningful progress on our net zero roadmap by reducing our emissions, increasing the number of our zero waste certified sites, and launching new greener products and shipping solutions.\nWe also formed new collaborations to improve health outcomes across the globe, and we were named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our significant contributions in diagnostics that help to advance health equity. Additionally, we continue to advance our STEM education programs, reaching more than 180,000 students globally. This helps to ensure we have students engaged in the sciences as ultimately they'll become our future customers. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. We have more than 120,000 passionate colleagues who are dedicated to enabling our customer success and advancing science.\nTogether we continue to build a bright future for our company, and I'm very excited about the year ahead. Let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into the guidance but let me quickly cover the highlights.\nIn 2025 we will once again deliver strong share gain, and our PPI Business System will enable outstanding execution, and we will deliver very strong earnings growth. We're initiating a 2025 revenue guidance in the range of $43.5 to 44 billion, which assumes 3% to 4% organic growth and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $23.1 to 23.5, which represents 6% to 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We're in a great position as we enter 2025. I'm incredibly excited by the opportunities we have with our customers and to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company.\nTo summarize our key takeaways for 2024, our proven growth strategy continued to drive significant share gain. We continue to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationships with many customers, and this in combination with the power of our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver an excellent finish to 2024 with differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year. As we enter 2025 with strong momentum, we are well positioned to deliver excellent financial performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO Stephen Williamson. Stephen.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we had an excellent Q4. The team executed really well in the quarter, and we delivered Q4 financials significantly ahead of what was assumed in the midpoint of our prior guide. We beat Q4 organic growth by just under 2 points, adjusted EPS by $0.14, and we ended the year with very strong free cash flow, delivering $7.3 billion for the year. Looking back on 2024, we had a very successful year. The markets played out as we outlined at the beginning of the year, with growth steadily improving each quarter.\nOur proven growth strategy drove consistent share gain, and the PPI Business System enabled great execution. All of this enabled us to consistently deliver differentiated financial performance throughout the year, all while further strengthening our industry leadership.\nThis puts us in a great position to deliver an excellent 2025. Let me now provide you with some additional details on our Q4 and full year 2024 performance. Starting with earnings per share in the quarter, adjusted EPS grew 8% to $6.10. For the full year we delivered adjusted EPS of $21.86. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.78, and for the full year it was $16.53. On the top line, Q4 reported revenue grew 5% year over year. The components of our reported revenue change included 4% organic growth, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a slight headwind from foreign exchange.\nIn Q4, core organic revenue increased 5%. For the full year 2024, reported organic and core organic revenue were all flat year over year. In 2024 we delivered $520 million of pandemic related revenue comprised of approximately $100 million of testing and $420 million from vaccines and therapies. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography in Q4, North America grew mid single digits, Europe grew low single digits, and Asia Pacific grew high single digits with China growing mid single digits. For the full year, North America declined low single digits, Europe was flat year over year, and Asia Pacific and China within Asia Pacific grew low single digits.\nWith respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.72 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, an increase of 7% year over year, and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, 50 basis points higher than Q4 last year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity reflecting the continued execution of our cost management initiatives, and we drove good volume pull through. This enabled us to fund strategic investments to further advance our industry leadership and offset the expected impact of unfavorable mix this quarter.\nFor the full year, we delivered $9.71 billion of adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 43.2%, 170 basis points higher than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 42.2%, an increase of 100 basis points versus 2023.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.1% of revenue; for the full year, adjusted SG&A was 16.3% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $374 million. In Q4, for the full year, R&D expense was $1.39 billion, up 4% year over year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for the full year was 7.2%. Looking at our results below the line, our Q4 net interest expense was $89 million, slightly higher than Q4 2023. Net interest expense for the full year was $312 million, a decrease of $183 million year over year driven by effective management of our debt portfolio, and our strong cash flow.\nThe adjusted tax rate was 10.9% in Q4 and 10.5% for the full year, in line with our expectations. Average diluted shares were $383 million in Q4, $5 million lower year over year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. In Q4 we repurchased $1 billion of shares, bringing our total repurchases for 2024 to $4 billion.\nTurning to free cash flow and the balance sheet, full-year cash flow from operations was $8.7 billion and free cash flow was $7.3 billion. After investing $1.3 billion of net capital expenditures during 2024, we deployed $7.7 billion of capital, $3.1 billion through M&A with the acquisition of Olink and $4.6 billion through the return of capital to shareholders in the form of $4 billion of buybacks and approximately $600 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $31.3 billion of total debt.\nOur leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.4x on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.6% reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company.\nNow provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment grew 5% and organic revenue growth was 3%. Growth in this segment was driven by our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue declined 3% and organic revenue was 4% lower versus 2023. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 36.6%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year quarter.\nDuring Q4 we delivered strong productivity and good volume pull through which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 36.4%, an increase of 210 basis points versus 2023.\nIn the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue grew 7% and organic revenue growth was 8%. The strong growth in the quarter was led by electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 3%. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 30.5%, up 170 basis points year over year. In the quarter we delivered strong productivity and good volume pull through and had favorable FX. This was partially offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments.\nFor the full year, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, 10 basis points lower than 2023. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q4 both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 5%. In Q4 growth in this segment was led by a transplant, diagnostics, and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as our healthcare market channel.\nFor the full year, reported revenue increased 2% and organic revenue growth was 3%. Q4 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 23.6%, 30 basis points lower than Q4 2023. During the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which is more than offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 3% higher than 2023 adjusted operating margin with 25.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year.\nAnd finally, in the laboratory products and biopharma services segments, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 4% versus the prior year quarter. The runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue had a mid-single-digit impact on the growth in this segment in Q4. This was offset by very good growth in our pharma services business, and research and safety market channel.\nFor the full year, reported revenue grew 1% and organic revenue was flat. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is flat to Q4 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is offset by strategic investments and unfavorable mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 8% and adjusted operating margin was 13.3%, which is 130 basis points lower versus 2023.\nTurning now to guidance as Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2025 revenue guidance range of $43.5 to 44 billion and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $23.1 to 23.5. This guidance assumes 3% to 4% organic revenue growth, a 1% headwind from the remaining runoff of the pandemic-related revenue, a 1.5% revenue headwind from foreign exchange, and approximately 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. All of this will enable a really strong 6% to 8% growth in adjusted EPS. The strength of the guidance reflects our industry-leading position, our proven growth strategy, and the power of our PPI Business System.\nLet me now provide some more detailed context behind the guide. Starting with the market growth framing, in 2024 we estimate the industry market growth was down low single digits. In 2025 we expect the market growth will be better than 2024.\nWe expect market growth will be slightly positive for the year, improving as the year progresses. With this market context and a very strong share gain, we expect organic growth for 2025 to be in the range of 3% to 4%. Now, as I commented earlier, this includes a 1% headwind from the remainder of the pandemic runoff, largely in our clinical research business, so the underlying total company growth is strong.\nTurning to FX, given recent changes in rates, we're assuming there'll be a headwind from revenue from FX in 2025 of approximately $650 million or 1.5 points. Putting all this together, our top line guidance assumes a 1.5% to 2.5% increase in reported revenue dollars and a 3% to 4% increase in organic revenue. This is a strong step up from 2024.\nMoving on to the bottom line, we expect to deliver a very strong year of adjusted EPS growth in 2025. The cost actions we took over the past couple of years are enabling very accretive pull through on the incremental dollars of revenue growth, and we will continue to use the PPI Business System to drive productivity and actively manage our cost base. This will enable very strong adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 90 basis points. Below the line, we're effectively managing our debt and cash positions and taking advantage of great interest rates from cash deposits.\nAll of this will enable us to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of $23.10 and $23.50, which is a very strong 6% to 8% growth for the year. In terms of potential changes in the macro environment, our guidance is assumed to cover the impact of modest policy changes.\nTo help you with your modeling, here are a few additional assumptions behind the guide. We expect approximately $315 million of net interest expense in 2025. We assume that the adjusted income tax rate will be 11.5% in 2025, largely driven by the increased earnings. We're expecting between $1.4 and $1.7 billion of net capital expenditures in 2025, and we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $7 to $7.4 billion for the year.\nIn terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $2 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January, and we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be between 378 and 379 million shares, and we're assuming return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. Finally, I wanted to touch on phasing for Q1.\nEmbedded in the guidance for the year is an assumption that organic growth is flat in Q1 as is adjusted EPS growth in Q1. This is largely driven by Q1 having two less selling days than the prior year quarter, and also the phasing of our services revenue within the year. In conclusion, Q4 capped off a very successful 2024. We expect to continue to manage the company and the opportunities really well in 2025, and a focus on delivering very strong share gains and adjusted EPS growth, enabling excellent financial performance. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back. Over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nOperator, we're ready for. The Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. We will now open the floor for the Q&A session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Now, please ensure your device is unmuted locally. If you change your mind or your question has already been answered, please press star followed by two. In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address Thermo Fisher management team, please limit your time on the call to one question and only one follow up. If you have any additional questions, please return to the queue. Our first question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start with something that you flagged briefly there in your closing remarks. Stephen, I think you mentioned modest policy changes built into the guide. I just, I'm wondering if you could expand on that and just broadly talk about guidance methodology going into 2025. It feels like there's a lot more uncertainty even despite where we're coming from the last couple years, specifically as it relates to policy and government changes, things like tariffs, NIH, export controls announced a couple weeks ago on some specific product lines.\nIt's still really tough and too early to say how these will play out. I'm just wondering if you, how much conservatism you build into the guide? What are your assumptions on some of these factors? Any additional color you could provide there would be helpful.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nMike, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with a summary actually of the key points, and then I'll talk a little bit about the, what's going on from a policy perspective, what we embedded in the guide. Bear with me a little bit. When I think about 2024, I think the key points are the team executed very well. The performance was quite differentiated financially, and really great momentum with our customers. Ultimately the trusted partner status continues to strengthen and positions the company for a bright future. Q4 was strong, right?\n4% organic growth, 8% growth in adjusted EPS, market conditions, they improved sequentially throughout the year as we expected. We saw positive growth within our expectation for the market in the Q4, and which is what we thought at the beginning of last year.\nThe predictability is back in our industry, which is great. When I think about 2025, what we're assuming in the guidance is that the market conditions will continue to strengthen as the year progresses, and we're entering the year with good momentum. Our focus, especially given that there's always some level of uncertainty or volatility, is to really deliver outstanding EPS growth this year.\nWhat we embedded in our guidance is 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth and our best view of the market, returning positive organically in terms of total and us delivering 3% to 4%. That's how we thought about it, and we're actively managing the business, so we're very excited about what's the year ahead.\nNow when I think about Policy changes, what's embedded. I think you know deeply our philosophy, within reason of changes or within reasons of opportunities. We just manage through it. It becomes. It's our job to manage through the unanticipated changes unless they're of such magnitude on the good side or the bad that we would articulate it. We thought about the environment where today there's a lot of ideas being discussed but not really yet materialized into any particular policies. What I'm very excited about is the business environment, particularly in the US, is going to be much more business friendly with much more of a focus on economic growth.\nI'm excited that from a M&A perspective we're likely to see a much more reasonable environment from a regulatory perspective. When I think about what our company does and what our customers do, science and medicine are unbelievably important, and they're not discretionary. Therefore, we're excited about it, and we'll navigate whatever the environment holds.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay, that's helpful Marc, thank you. Then for a quick follow up in terms of the EPS guide, you're right. Better earnings power than we had anticipated, I think most anticipated. Stephen, I think you said 90 basis points, operating margin expansion that's very strong, especially given the subdued top line environment. If you could expand on that. You mentioned some of the cost actions you've taken in the past, but are there incremental cost actions throughout 2025? What's the contribution from return to volume growth or maybe mix shift, just any color on that 90 basis points? Thanks.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Mike. Yeah, that's the right number. Yeah, really good volume pull through. When I think about the cost actions, we've taken over the past couple of years as we've wound down from the impact of the pandemic and certain areas of our business have had lower volumes than normal, like coming back to more normal volumes. Then we're making sure that the incremental revenue is pulling through at a really high clip. So great to see that. That's embedded in the numbers. Then it's not just huge cost initiatives.\nIt's about just managing our P&L appropriately and using the PPI Business System to be able to do that. Driving very strong productivity and good cost management in the top line environment that we're in for the years. Bring that all together. That's what's driving the 90 basis points.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks Marc.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you so much. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JP Morgan\n\nPerfect. Good morning and thank you so much for taking the questions. I wanted to follow up on your answer to Mike's first question around some of the policy changes that we've seen, but specifically to NIH funding. Obviously we've seen some of the reports the last few weeks around potentially getting frozen in light of the new administration. Appreciate that it's early days and. We don't know what some of these. Policies could ultimately look like.\nAt the same time, you would have to imagine that some of these headlines are driving disruption at your customers. Can you walk us through what have you seen since the new administration? Turnover in terms of customers' behavior, especially within that academic and government market. How are you actually expecting NIH funding to play out this year?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Rachel, it's been nine days. In terms of the environment. I don't think there's any real insight into. What's going on. Obviously, there's actually no policies yet. There are different things being explored. Our job is to work collaboratively with the administration. We have a good working relationship certainly with the President's first administration.\nEducate on the importance of our industry and our customers' work and help our customers navigate the environment as well. From my perspective, I look at, we'll help our customers navigate whatever it is. When I think about what's embedded in our guidance, I would say, for academic and government, globally.\nWould be around the company average in terms of what's assumed there and maybe slightly below that, because I think pharma and biotech ultimately be a little bit better than the company average this year in terms of the end markets. When you think about that, about half of our academic and government end market is in the US and half is in markets around the world. Interestingly enough, we obviously had an incredibly strong finish in academic and government in Q4. It was globally strong. Right? It was really. Every market had really a very strong end to the year. Hopefully that's helpful.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JP Morgan\n\nYeah, that is. Thanks for framing that up. To follow up then I just wanted to ask on analytical instrumentation, obviously that was a really nice quarter in Q4. Can you walk us through some of the drivers of that beat? Did you guys see any budget flush trends in the quarter, and was there any benefit from China stimulus in that number? And then when you look at analytical instrumentation performance for 2025, what are your assumptions regarding China stimulus contribution? Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Rachel, thanks. Our instrument business once again had a really very positive year, capped off with 8% organic growth in the Q4, 3% growth for the full year. That's an environment where China was relatively muted for the full year. As you know, China is a meaningful contributor to the instruments business across the industry. Team really doing a great job. What drives that? It's the steady drumbeat of innovation that makes a huge difference.\nIf you think about even in my remarks, I had to really narrow it down like in terms of the number of products we launch. You see one instrument after another; you see many other reagents and other products. We are just on a roll in terms of phenomenal new products.\nWhether it's in electron microscopy, whether it's in chromatography and mass spectrometry, and also in the environmental type applications with ion chromatography, with ICP-MS, just really strong and the adoption is great and that's driving meaningful share gain. The way that our business works is you have relevant innovation customers because of the importance of the work they're doing; they find the funding. That's how it showed up in terms of stimulus in China and how we thought about it. It was actually nice to see revenue. It wasn't huge, but it was nice to see revenue flow in the instruments business.\nIn Q4, orders were actually stronger in terms of the orders that we received in China on our instruments that will obviously ship in 2025. Stimulus started to flow there as well. Hopefully it gives you a good sense of the momentum in our instruments business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you and good morning. Stephen, you talked about the phasing of. Good morning. Forget if it was Stephen or Marc. You talked about the phasing of services. Revenue during the year. Albeit, what does the guide assume? For PPD clinical research? Can you give us an update? Just color on what you're seeing in terms of new authorizations.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. I'll give the phasing aspect to it, and Marc will give you some more detail about the businesses, which are both in great shape, by the way. When I think about phasing within the year, I said that in Q1, there's some timing and the phasing there, it's largely the pandemic related runoff is more pronounced in Q1 given the comps from last year. That's the largest piece of phasing. There's a little bit of phasing quarter to quarter in terms of the overall phasing for our pharma services business. That's in the normal noise, but that's probably the largest driver that I talked about in Q1.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYes. Jack, when I think about the clinical research capabilities that we have, we're a leader. Incredible reputation for innovation, quality, and performance for our customers. When you think about that, one of the things that we've been talking a little bit about, I try to highlight it more today, was the combination with our pharma services business. As you know, in pharma services, we're a leading provider of contract development and manufacturing capabilities. We spent over three years looking at the added value of having those both sets of capabilities, the insights you get, and the impact that you can have for the customers.\nWhen we launched Accelerator Drug Development, it really is compelling. What that really is allowing our customers to do is to leverage our expertise and capabilities to improve the returns on investment of their R&D investments, which is everything in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. We're excited.\nWhen I think about now more of the details and I think about clinical research, we delivered low single-digit organic growth last year. The team did a good job, really good job. That was to basically grow the business despite the very meaningful headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies that was in that business. When I think to the future about 2025.\nThe business is behaving the way that I would think it should, which it's a long cycle business. You saw, for the industry and even with us, low single digit growth last year; that's below the trend line. The trend line for this business is a high single digit growth business. It's the result of 2023's biotech environment and 2023 and 2024's pharmaceutical customers actually reprioritizing their portfolios for the IRA. When I look at authorizations, particularly in the back half of 2024, they were very strong for us.\nWhen I look at the commercial pipeline that we have this year and the conversations that our executive team is having with our customers, the business actually has a lot of momentum underlying. If I think about the cycle time of the business, that bodes well towards the end of the year and entering 2026. It feels like the conditions will be more measured this year. That's what's embedded in our guidance, similar to what we saw last year. Then it sets up for great success. Overall, super positive.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nAwesome. You're leading me exactly where I want to go next, which is the guide for 2026. Mostly joking but can you just talk about as you look at the phase and the guide in 2025. What does the exit rate look like in the Q4? Just more broadly, just like confidence about your ability to get back to the LRP targets that you have.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. Jack, I'll be thrilled to talk to you about 2026 on this call in a year's time. I understand that you think about that and how you're thinking about the trajectory of the company. Yeah. First of all, we're highly confident we're going to get back to the industry long-term market growth rate of 4% to 6%. It's just a matter of what the timing is you actually get to that point. We've proven the ability to consistently drive share gain above that. Our organic growth will be stronger than markets. It's great that markets are improving. When I think about what the guide setup is here, going from market down a couple of points to being up slightly. That's a continued improvement.\nWe expect that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect that to continue to increase as we go through the year. The exact ending point of where market growth will be at the end of the year. We'll see that as we get close towards the end of the year. As Marc said at the beginning, our job in this period of going through that transition back to normal is to drive really strong adjusted EPS growth. That's exactly what we're doing, setting out to do here for the year ahead.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nAwesome. Thanks Steve.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks Jack.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nStephen.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nDoug, you unmute.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning, guys. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple questions on guidance. The first is on the top line, and I'm just sitting here playing with the model, thinking through the stacks, thinking through the comps, thinking about what you talked about for the Q1 starting rate. That leads me to a question of are you expecting to exit 2025 back in your targeted 7% to 9% organic growth range? I can see where you're at least close to the low end of that. That's my first question. My second is back to the topic of the 90 basis points of targeted operating margin expansion that is embedded in your guidance. This would be particularly impressive in any period.\nIt's especially notable right now, given your revenue growth rate for the year is below your long-term construct, and there has been speculation that you wouldn't be able to get anywhere close to that type of margin expansion with a lower level of growth. Obviously, you expect to do that. The questions are one, what's allowing you to do this in 2025? Is this a function of mix? Is it a function of basically the benefit of operating really tightly in a tough environment and starting to come out of it? Is it something else?\nThen the other part of that is, are there reasons we shouldn't assume a continuation of this type of margin potential as we think about future years where you are getting back into your normalized growth construct? Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nDoug. Thanks for the question. Let me start with context. If I think about the many interactions that I have with investors over many years, but certainly over, let's say, the last six, nine months. A lot of the investors have been focused on, and certainly analyst community as well, what's the momentary change in the trajectory of the growth rate of the industry. We understand why because it's an amazing industry with an incredible future and we're in a recovering environment.\nOne of the things as a management team, as you know, we're very focused on great performance and great execution is what's going to be most helpful to our shareholders in creating value and creating a bright future. We're in a recovering market and we're expecting a better year in terms of market environment, better year in organic growth this year. The thing that we can control is how great is our earnings per share. That's through the power of our PPI Business System.\nStrong execution, cost discipline is not a mix driver or any of those things. As a leadership team, what we're focused on is delivering another very differentiated year and fully focused on the thing that we can control, which is how we drive from revenue down to the bottom line. It's not the long-term new number, but it's the right number for 2025. I think the 40 basis points to 50 basis points of long-term expansion associated with 7% to 9% is an appropriate driver. This year that's the way I would think about it.\nIn terms of the 3% to 4%, one thing that we all should just remind ourselves: there's a point of headwind in that number for the final runoff of the pandemic. Our assumption is effectively zero pandemic-related revenue this year, revenue this year. You can say the normalized growth is getting back to stronger growth, but it's not yet at 7% to 9%. You can do the phasing if you're assuming as Stephen has laid out a flat start to the year. We understand that's clearly why it's not about a market thing. It's the phasing of days and how we see the service revenue specifically laying out.\nYou're going to wind up with something in the strong mid-single digits at the end of the year for us. You can say, there's a point of headwind, so you're not quite at the 7% to 9%, but you're progressing in a direction that would be encouraging, and we're excited for this year. Like, this is a big step up in expectations, and we're going to deliver it versus last year, and the quarter after quarter of just better market conditions sets us up for an incredible future.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Tycho, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director of Global Equities, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Marc, I want to probe a little more on the accelerator program and really just try to understand why now is the right time. Synergies for PPD have gone well. Any kind of bogey you can. Pointing to in the next couple years in terms of how you're thinking about synergies, is this more for small or large customers, more on the CDMO side? Or CRO side and has this brought. To highlight any additional service offerings that you might need to bring to these customers.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific",
    "content2": "Tycho, thanks for the question. One thing that I've learned. It's held deeply ingrained in our customer base; you don't make promises that you don't have 100% confidence that you are going to be able to deliver. That's what our customers expect of us. If you remember back to the announcement of the acquisition of PPD, we talked about the potential to bend the time and cost curve of developing medicines. That was a strategy that we articulated. Then you haven't heard us talk about it really at all for the last three years.\nNot because we weren't working on it, but because we wouldn't declare that opportunity until we had the proof cases in place. Customers actually leveraging the combined capabilities of the company and the confidence that we can have great conversations with our customers.\nTo continue to deliver great results for them. The authorizations momentum is very strong in terms of how our customers perceive our capabilities and performance. Customers can pick and choose, right? It's not that they have to buy everything, but rather they can pick the relevant insights from us and the relevant expertise to shave the weeks and months off of the timelines to be more cost-effective and leverage our expertise. The excitement is very substantial.\nWhen I think about, we're seeing interest and excitement and authorizations and orders, orders being on the pharma services landscape. What we're seeing it is it's faster in biotech because you have a decision maker that has the whole domain. We're seeing great interest in large pharma as well.\nWith large pharma you typically will pick a molecule, a part of their pipeline, and work that way. Biotech, it typically will work across everything they're doing. It's exciting times and we're just getting going. As you know, these are long cycle businesses, so it takes some time to actually translate the authorizations and orders into revenue. It bodes really well for the acceleration of growth certainly in 2026 and beyond.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director of Global Equities, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Then, follow up on China. I didn't actually hear what you're assuming for China growth this year. You're assuming your products come off the trade restrictions list. I think last time you were able to get them off. Then I know you don't have as much exposure to volume-based procurement, but how are you thinking about exposure there? And obviously the headwinds have magnified.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. In terms of China. When I think about the year, first of all, 2024, and that's a reasonable framing for the next year, we really had a very strong year in a very, very challenged environment. The economy is challenged, the end market is challenged. Our business in the Q4 grew mid single digits. We grew low single digits for the full year.\nClearly gaining market share. The team's done a good job. Our expectation is that the environment is similar to what we saw last year. Stimulus will be a benefit, and there'll be just. We're not assuming any recovery from an economic perspective, and that may change. That may be a bad assumption. We don't see any evidence yet of a real strengthening environment other than stimulus. We just assume that the conditions will continue to be somewhat muted and similar to last year. In terms of health care, value-based procurement, and some of the reimbursement things that have been executed.\nYour framing is exactly right, which is very small for us. Because our diagnostic business in China is very much in the specialty area, it's not a large business. While there's a little bit of a headwind, it's fully embedded in our guidance and it's not a meaningful number. That's how we left it.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYep, certainly. Our next question is from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYeah, hi, Marc. Thanks for taking my question. I'll wrap my question in one. On the biopharma side and the biotech side, could you elaborate what you're hearing from your larger biopharma large cap customers versus the early emerging biotechs? Another brief question on the therapeutic side, Marc about 75% of the IND filings to the FDA in 2024 molecules from China or assets from China.\nThat number used to be very small in 2023 and practically nothing in 2019. My question is, if more of the drug discovery pivots to China, how do you think Thermo is positioned? What are the implications for Thermo and for the tools industry overall? If you could. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. You know what I love about January? There's many things I love about January, but is I get to spend an enormous time with our customers. Both out on the West Coast where many convene as well as in Europe. I've seen quite a number of customers, and if I say what are the themes? If I start with the larger customers, the larger biopharma.\nReally a real change in confidence, like really quite positive in terms of how they enter the year, feeling like the actions that they've taken over the last couple of years have put their companies in a good spot. Obviously, some companies are benefiting hugely from. The GLP-1s and there's great confidence there obviously for and that excites everybody in terms of the ability to have very relevant medicines that can get adopted quickly and help human health. Actually it feels to me that large pharma is meaningfully in a better mind space which will help over time grow budgets.\nWhen I think about the more of emerging customers, actually that also was positive. There seems to be a reasonable confidence on funding and partnerships to allow for funding to continue to improve as the year unfolds and still recovering, but certainly better. In terms of where innovation is, I think ultimately what you're seeing, as a few years back, it became really very difficult for a China based company to serve the global market. You're seeing more licensing deals; there's a huge amount of work that happens in the western labs after things are licensed.\nWe're well positioned in China, but we're obviously well positioned globally. Thank you for the question. Let me wrap up with just a couple, a couple quick things. First of all, thanks everyone for participating in the call today. We entered this year with strong momentum and we're in a great position to deliver an excellent 2025. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much everyone for joining us. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

So with that I'll now turn the. call over to Marc Casper. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had great results for the quarter. We're making excellent progress to deliver differentiated results for the year. I'm proud of our team as they executed at a very high level to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. This continued success is a result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System. So first let me recap the financials.\nOur revenue in the quarter was $10.54 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.35 billion. Adjusted operating margin increased in Q2 to 22.3%, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 4% increase year-over-year to $5.37 per share. Our performance in the second quarter is allowing us to raise our guidance once again and continues our track record of delivering differentiated results. Turning to our performance by end market in the second quarter, underlying market conditions played out as we'd expected.\nOur team's excellent execution drove share gain in the quarter and we delivered a sequential improvement in growth in all four of our end markets. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we declined in the low single digits for the quarter. The vaccine and therapy revenue runoff resulted in a 4 point headwind for this customer segment. Performance in the second quarter was led by our biosciences and clinical research businesses in academic and government, and in industrial and applied.\nWe grew in the low single digits during the quarter. In both these end markets, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we declined in the low single digits. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end market is impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, the team delivered good core revenue growth highlighted by our transplant, diagnostic, and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as our healthcare market channel.\nAs I reflect on our performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I feel very good about the progress we've made. At the halfway point of the year, our end markets are playing out as we expected, and our team's execution has been excellent. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine.\nStarting with the first pillar, it was a fantastic quarter of innovation as we launched a number of high-impact new products across our businesses. I'll begin with the new technologies we launched at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, further strengthening our industry-leading position in analytical instruments. At the conference we introduced the Thermo Scientific Stellar Mass Spectrometer, which extends our leadership in proteomics. The Thermo Scientific Stellar is used to validate biomarker candidates.\nIt offers unprecedented analytical capabilities for targeted quantitation, enabling the insights needed by researchers to advance their work. It's a perfect complement to our groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral used for protein discovery that we launched last year. It was incredibly exciting to hear the customer testimonials sharing the power of the Orbitrap Astral. To date, we've had more than 40 publications that incorporated the impact of this breakthrough, and we're really just getting started.\nAlso at ASMS, we launched three new built-for-purpose editions of the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid Mass Spectrometer tailored to specific applications for multiomics, structural biology, and biopharma. These instruments continue to elevate our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio by offering enhanced speed and sensitivity to detect and characterize the most difficult protein samples and including complex biologics. This quarter, we also launched products to help our customers meet their own sustainability goals. In our bioproduction business, we introduced a first of its kind bio-based film for our single-use technologies.\nThese new bioprocess containers use plant-based material rather than fossil fuel materials to provide lower carbon solutions for the manufacture of biologics. In our laboratory products business, we launched a new line of Energy Star Certified Thermo Scientific TSX Universal Series ULT freezers that deliver industry-leading performance and energy efficiency to help labs meet their sustainability goals.\nTurning to the highlights of our second and third pillars of our growth strategy, during the quarter we continue to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engineering and the trusted partner status we've earned with our customers. Our customers rely on us to help accelerate their innovation, increase their productivity, and advance their important work. I spend a lot of time connecting with customers to understand their near and long-term priorities so that we can enable their success.\nAs a result of these unique relationships, we continue to advance our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. Let me give you a couple of examples from the second quarter. We expanded our leading clinical trial supply services with a new ultracold facility in Bleiswijk in the Netherlands to offer pharma and biotech customers tailored end-to-end support throughout the clinical supply chain for high-value therapies including cell and gene therapies, biologics, antibodies, and vaccines.\nWe also opened a state-of-the-art innovation lab at our site in Center Valley, Pennsylvania to showcase our innovative solutions for global clinical trial supply including new packaging solutions, real-time tracking and tracing, and enhanced clinical trial setup and planning. In addition, we advanced partnerships and collaborations with our customers during the quarter. Let me give you a couple of examples.\nIn the Asia Pacific region to support Indonesia's growing investments in health care, scientific research, and renewable energy, we further expanded our presence and capabilities to in the country. We are collaborating with the National Battery Research Institute to advance battery technology and energy storage as well as with the Mandaya Hospital Group to help advance stem cell research and cell therapy development.\nIn Singapore, we announced a collaboration with the National University Hospital and Mirxes, a local RNA technology company, to develop and clinically validate advanced next generation sequencing genomic testing solutions specifically made to address the needs of the Southeast Asian population. Another strong quarter of executing our growth strategy. Let me now turn to our PPI Business System which enabled excellent execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day.\nDuring the quarter, I had the opportunity to see the PPI efforts to further improve manufacturing of our lab equipment products, and I came away incredibly impressed with the progress to drive operational efficiency in this business. It's also great to see how PPI has been adopted in our clinical research business where it is driving meaningful improvements in our efficiency and customer allegiance.\nUltimately, you see the positive impact of our PPI business system in our Q2 results reflected in strong profitability and cash flow that we delivered in the quarter. We also advanced our corporate social responsibility priorities during the quarter. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also create a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet.\nWe continue to make progress on our environmental sustainability roadmap in Q2 as part of our commitment to safeguarding the world's natural resources. We have set targets for 2025 which include zero waste certification for 30 manufacturing and warehouse sites. During the quarter, three more of our sites achieved zero waste certification and we're on track to achieve our goals. You can learn much more about our progress in our 2023 Corporate Social Responsibility Report which was published during the quarter.\nThe report provides a transparent account of our journey as we fulfill our commitments to society and all of our stakeholders. Let me now give you an update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Shortly after the quarter ended, we completed our acquisition of Olink, and it was great to welcome our new colleagues to the company earlier this month.\nAs you know, Olink is a leading provider of next generation proteomics solutions. The addition of Olink's proven and transformative technology is highly complementary to our industry leading mass spectrometers. Olink further advances our leadership as it is a great addition to our differentiated protein research ecosystem. Our world class commercial engine will enable us to bring this technology to scientists around the world. By increasing the use of NextGen Proteomics and providing industry leading quadratic quality at scale.\nExcuse me, data quality at scale. We're in a great position to further enhance the understanding of human biology and meaningfully accelerate scientific breakthroughs. So as I reflect on the quarter, I'm proud of what our team accomplished and grateful to their contributions to our success. Let me now turn to our guidance. Given our strong performance in the second quarter, we're raising our 2024 guidance.\nWe now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.29 to $22.07 per share. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. To summarize our key takeaways from Q2, we delivered another quarter of strong results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI businesses. We continue to enable our customer success, and this reinforces our trusted partner status as an industry leadership. Our strong results in Q2 allowed us to raise our guidance again for the year.\nWe're well positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO Stephen Williamson.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, then provide color on our four business segments, and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view on how the second quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call.\nAs Marc mentioned, in the quarter, market conditions were as we'd expected, yet another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q2 financials ahead of what we'd assumed in our prior guidance. Starting with the top line, core organic revenue growth was a little over 0.5 percentage points ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q2. That translates to approximately $60 million of revenue, which is partially offset by slightly higher FX revenue headwind.\nTurning to the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $0.25 ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q2. $0.08 was from some strong operational performance, $0.06 was from favorable FX and timing of discrete tax planning benefits within the year, and $0.11 was from the beat, which was from lower net interest expense. In my prior guidance, I took a prudent approach to the Olink transaction from a financing cost standpoint. We're also executing well on free cash flow generation year-to-date.\nFree cash flow is 68% higher than the same period last year, so we're continuing to deliver strong performance and were well positioned at the halfway point of the year. Let me now provide you with some additional details on Q2. Beginning with the earnings per share in the quarter, Adjusted EPS grew by 4% to $5.37. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.04, up 15% from Q2 last year. On the top line in Q2, reported revenue was 1% lower year-over-year.\nThe components of our Q2 reported revenue change included 1% lower organic revenue, a 1% headwind from foreign exchange, and a slight contribution from acquisitions. We delivered another strong sequential improvement in core organic revenue growth this quarter and in Q2. Core organic revenue growth rounded up to flat on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. Pandemic-related revenue was approximately $115 million. This was mainly from vaccines and therapies. This represents a 3% headwind to organic revenue growth.\nTurning to our organic revenue performance by geography in Q2, North America declined mid-single digits, Europe grew low single digits, and Asia Pacific grew mid single digits, which includes China, which also grew mid single digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.3 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, 10 basis points higher than Q2 last year and 30 basis points higher than Q1 2024.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 42.1%, 110 basis points higher than Q2 last year. In the quarter we continue to deliver very strong productivity reflecting our continued focus on cost management as well as the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year.\nThis enabled us to more than offset the impact of lower volumes, which, while appropriately funding investments to further advance our industry leadership. Moving on to the details of P&L, Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.6% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $340 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation R&D, as a percent of our manufacturing revenue, it was 7.1% in the quarter.\nLooking at results below the line, our Q2 net interest expense was $59 million, which is $89 million lower than Q2 2023 due to higher cash and investment balances. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%, and average diluted shares were 383 million in Q2, approximately $5 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution.\nTurning to free cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $3.2 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $2.6 billion. After investing $630 million of net capital expenditures, we ended the quarter with $8.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, and $35.4 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, and 2.5x on a net debt basis. Including my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.8%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company.\nNow provide some color on our performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 4%, and organic revenue was 3% lower than the prior year. Q2 growth in this segment was led by our biosciences business that was more than offset by the impact of the pandemic. Q2 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased 6%, and adjusted operating margin was 36.7%, up 350 basis points versus the prior year quarter.\nDuring Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull through. The team continues to do an excellent job to appropriately manage the cost base and deal with the unwind of the pandemic. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue grew 2%, and organic growth was 3% higher than the prior year.\nquarter, we continue to deliver very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 24.6%, 10 basis points lower. Year-over-year, in the quarter we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning to specialty diagnostics in Q2, both reported and organic revenue were 1% higher than the prior year.\nIn the quarter in Q2, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as in our healthcare market channel. Q2 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which was flat compared to Q2 2023. During the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which is offset by strategic investments, and finally, in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment, both reported revenue and organic growth decreased 1% in Q2 versus the prior year quarter.\nThis is driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies. Revenue growth in this segment in Q2 was led by our Clinical Research business. Q2 adjusted operating income declined 10%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, which is 120 basis points lower in Q2 2023, flat sequentially to Q1 2024. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance. As Marc outlined, given our strong performance in Q2, we're raising our 2024 full year guidance.\nWe now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to 43.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.29 to $22.07. The improved revenue guidance does not change the core organic revenue growth rounding for the year, so we still continue to assume core organic revenue growth will be in the range of -1% to +1% for 2024, and we continue to assume that the market declines low single digits this year. Our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again.\nOur 2024 updated guidance range assumes an adjusted operating income margin between 22.5% and 22.8%, slightly higher than the prior guide. Our PPI Business System is continuing to enable excellent execution, manage costs appropriately, and fund the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership.\nWe now expect net interest costs to be in the range of $380 to 400 million for the year, and the raise to our adjusted EPS guidance range reflects a $0.15 increase on the low end and a $0.05 increase on the high end, which results in an increase in the midpoint by $0.10. So another strong quarter of execution enabling an increase in the guidance outlook for the year. We remain really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance.\nI thought it would be helpful to remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 to 400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 to 1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. We've seen that FX would be roughly neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS.\nWe're assuming that the $0.03 FX adjusted EPS beat that we saw in Q2 is offset for the remainder of the year, leading to no change for the year as a whole. For FX versus the prior guidance, we continue to expect adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024. For the year, we're assuming between $1.3 and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 to $7 billion. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks which were already completed in January.\nWe expect to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we deployed $3.1 billion to acquire Olink shortly after the Q2 close. Full year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. Finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing to help you with your modeling. Relative to the midpoint of the guide, I recommend modeling Q3 organic revenue growth 1% higher than we delivered in Q2. Also good to model core organic revenue growth in Q3 1% higher than we delivered in Q2.\nIn terms of Adjusted EPS in Q3, I recommend modeling it to be just over 24% of the full year. So to conclude, we continue to deliver on our commitments and at the halfway point we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders. 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\noperator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Now, if you change your mind, please press star followed by two in order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher management team. Please limit your time on the call to one question, one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue.\nOur first question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGreat.\nThanks for taking the questions, guys.\nCongrats on the quarter, Marc. A high-level one for you to.\nStart off maybe at our Vegas Healthcare Conference in May. You made some initial comments about 2025 market expectations, and you said that you expect the tools market next year would be just below the 4 to 6 level it has historically been. Just given the way the year is playing out, how you're exiting 2024, entering 2025, it's been a couple of months since then. You've got hopefully clearer view of how 24 is going to play out.\nSo given where you sit now, do.\nYou have more confidence in that 2025 market assumption, and maybe how Thermo can deliver differentiated performance above that?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nMike, thanks for the question. It was a pleasure to be with you earlier in the quarter. So let me start actually one level off, just kind of frame a few of my general thoughts and I'll talk about 2025.\nWhen I think about Q2.\nYou know, the team executed really well, really good financial performance. It was ahead of our expectations, allowed us to raise our guidance. The other aspect of the performance is the actual performance as opposed to relative to expectations. Clearly very differentiated and very strong. It was good to see that core has now, you know, elevated to. It's now flat, which is great. 4% Adjusted EPS growth and expansion of margins. So I feel very good about the performance, and when I think about the market, you know, they were in line with our expectations.\nSo it's good to see the visibility that we've enjoyed for decades, you know, as returns in terms of how the market's playing out. You know, when I think about our own performance within the markets, it was good to see that all four of our markets, we had sequential improvement in our growth across all four. So really, you know, very positive development. PPI Business System is really delivering outstanding impact, and ultimately feel good about the performance.\nCapital deployment has been active and good. We've deployed over $6 billion of capital through the first half of the year. Half of it on return of capital and half of it on a very exciting acquisition of Olink. We're very well positioned at this point to deliver strong results. When I think about 2025, I think the way I would just think about it is we're going to give you that in January of 2025, when we have the benefit of the year behind us and we're focused on delivering a great year,\nwe'll be able to give you a view of not only our performance, but how we saw the underlying market conditions. The year is progressing as we expected, so we expect that the market will continue to improve modestly in the back half of the year, each quarter being a little better than the quarter before, and that our performance will also continue to step up, and that will give us momentum going into 2025, and the details we'll give you back, we'll give you in a few months time.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nOkay, fair enough.\nAnd then for my follow up, I want to focus on China. I think if I heard correctly you.\nCalled out that it grew mid-single digits in the quarter.\nI want to make sure I heard that right. If so that's a bit surprising. Anything you can say in terms of?\nWhat you're seeing there is that also.\nAhead of your expectations, and is this.\nJust a temporary bump in the quarter, something one timey, or are you seeing?\nSome real traction here?\nAnything that continue into your end.\nThanks.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, you know your hearing is excellent. So yes, we delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. Team did a nice job, really good execution. Comparison was relatively easy in the quarter. So. And I would still characterize the conditions as muted in terms of the environment, but nice. A nice job by the team to deliver, you know, a very solid Q2 result. Thanks Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much.\nOur next question is from Jack Meehan. Jack, your line is now open.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nAnalyst, Bellwether\n\nThanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to start by asking about LSS. This had some nice sequential improvement in the growth rate. I heard Biosciences has led to growth. Can you talk about the relative improvement you're seeing there? Also, Genetic Sciences, Bioprocessing, and any updates on where you think your customers stand in terms of feedstock?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Jack, thanks for the question. When I think about probably the most important points on our Life Sciences Solutions segment, nice to see the growth in our Biosciences business that's, you know, every lab, every day, really nice adoption in the pharma and biotech segment there. So that was very nice positive development terms there. And maybe I'll dive a little bit into bioproduction, which is always an area of great interest to our investors.\nThe business is actually progressing really exactly as we expected. Really nice quarter of performance. So when I think about the most salient facts around bioproduction, sequentially, really nice revenue growth in Q2. When I look at orders, we had really nice sequential growth in orders. We had year-over-year growth in orders, and we had a favorable book-to-bill, so progressing well. And when I look at others that have reported, I feel very good about our performance.\nSo when I think about the life science solutions segment, those are two of the drivers. And then you've seen some announcements in the previous few months about important companion diagnostics. Our clinical sequencing business is doing quite well. So, Jack, thanks for the question on LSS.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nAnalyst, Bellwether\n\nExcellent.\nOkay.\nAnd then wanted to rotate to the AI. So this also came in a bit better than I was expecting. Can you talk about how the book-to-bill was in the segment in the quarter and just updates on customer spending patterns? Thanks.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, so when I think about analytical instruments, you know, it was nice to see the 3% growth in the quarter and very positive. You know, I would say the market conditions also playing out pretty much as we expected. They're not at the normal levels yet. We certainly see the impact of the muted conditions in China. We have really excellent momentum in those differentiated products that we have where innovation matters on orders as well as on revenue.\nWhen you look at electron microscopy, you look at the Orbitrap Astral, just the cutting edge work, you see an incredibly strong momentum there. So that's where the highlights are. And I would say in the more routine-ish aspects of the portfolio, you see more muted conditions.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Jack.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase and Company\n\nPerfect.\nHi, good morning, you guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to follow up on some of the China comments. You mentioned that China grew mid-single-digits partly due to the comp there. Can you just walk us through what are you seeing from China stimulus? You know, we heard that this first tranche of funding was released earlier this quarter. So have you seen any orders related to China stimulus? Do you think that you'll benefit from this first tranche?\nAnd then also have you seen any customers holding back spending related to the stimulus program? Kind of getting at this like air pocket idea that we've heard some of.\nYour peers talk about.\nAny comments there would be helpful.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nRachel, thanks for the question. It's an important question. So let me start at the sort of high level and then get down to the stimulus and try to as much transparency as I possibly can. First of all, I think the world was surprised at how weak China was economically as this year unfolded. The stimulus programs announced early in the year was a sign that the government wanted to get the economy going, which is a good thing, right? In terms of sort of what is the macro backdrop in terms of a tough economic environment.\nWhen I think about stimulus in our industry and what we're seeing. Tremendous amount of activity with our customers, actually, to help them with figuring out what to apply for. So we know there's quite a bit of interest in our products from a stimulus perspective, and we're helping our customers in that process. When I think about how I expect it to play out, my expectation is that it's largely going to show up in revenue in 2025 and likely to have some small effect in Q4 2024 as well.\nI did ask the question about an air pocket to the team, and I'm actually heading off to China in a couple weeks time, so I'm looking forward to that. Our team didn't highlight any air pocket or anything like that. They said kind of, you know, muted conditions. Customers are working on looking at the investments associated with the additional government funding. We didn't see any pauses in the activity. I'm proud of the team's mid-single-digit growth in the quarter.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase and Company\n\nGreat.\nJust as my follow up here on the CRO, you called out clinical research with an outperformer this quarter.\nThat drove some of the growth.\nSo we've seen a few volatile prints from your peers. So could you walk us through what have you seen from an RFP standpoint and book-to-bill in the quarter for PPD, and then have we turned the corner on emerging biotech funding and kind of how is that flowing through the model as well?\nThanks.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYes. So Rachel, team's doing a really nice job executing very well in our clinical research business.\nAnd you know, when I think about our performance, you know, we delivered positive, you know, organic revenue growth despite a really substantial headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies in that activity. So team's doing a nice job. Commercial execution was very strong in the quarter. Right. And customers value our capabilities. And when I sort of went under the details of the commercial performance and looked at some of the underlying trends,\nit was very clear that in Q2 we really did see some of the biotech funding activity that we talked about as a green shoot in Q1 that would give us confidence that the year in aggregate across our business would be improving from a market perspective. We saw that in Q2 actually translate into an acceleration of authorizations in our biotech customer base. And that really does bode well for that.\nAs you know, well, this business that really translates more into revenue in 2025 and 2026 in terms of how long it takes to get the clinical trials up and going. But the authorization momentum, very encouraging in the quarter.\nThank you, Rachel.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Marc.\nWhen we look at your stacks and calculate CAGRs going back pre-pandemic, it seems like most business lines within Thermo continue to trend positively. I think your commentary is consistent with that on the call this morning. With that in mind, I think one of the key questions is what's going to be the pace of improvement from here? So with that in mind, two questions. First, where is the recovery occurring more quickly than you may have expected? Where are things lagging?\nYou know, and I'm kind of thinking.\nAbout this, both in terms of, you know, how you guided for the year, but also just based on what you've seen through previous cycles.\nSo that's one question. And then the second would be just keeping in mind your assumption that this market grows 4% to 6% on a normalized basis, is it fair to assume that, you know, recognizing you're making progress here, but just seeing what the pacing is, is it fair to assume that the move back into that range is going to be gradual versus a snapback and, you know, essentially that this move into the 4% to 6% range is going to take several quarter.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah.\nSo, Doug, there's a lot in that question. It's a good question. So let me just start with. I think the things that are around the market and our performance that's important to our investors, right? You know, pre-2023, you know, holding aside some of the amazing market in our performance in the pandemic period, a very predictable, visible market without a lot of volatility and really a great underlying set of growth, right? So there's never debates about market growth sort of pre-pandemic or even in the early parts of the pandemic.\nAnd then obviously a difficult year for the industry in 2023, you know, comparisons and a lot of other factors related to the pandemic directly and indirectly. So when I think about what we're seeing in the industry now for three quarters in a row, the visibility is pretty good.\nLike we have a good feel for what's going on. It's playing out as we expected. There's always things a little better, a little worse. They're all so irrelevant on the, you know, on the margin. They're all in the factor of the aggregate. So I feel very good about the progression. When what's embedded in our guidance in the market, right, is that, you know, for the full year, is that it continues to step up a little bit more in Q3 and further in Q4.\nAnd when I think about what we've assumed in the market growth back in the January timeframe when we gave our guidance, as we said the market was going to be down low-single-digits.\nBut when you looked at sort of the phasing implied, it probably is flattish, maybe up slightly in the fourth quarter in terms of the market progression. We don't have a perfect crystal ball, but that sort of wasn't applied in the math. And so it's progressing well. When I think, too, you know, how it's going to progress exactly each quarter thereafter, you know, when we get to January, I'll have a much better feel for it. But I think what's really relevant is how do I feel about the four to six. Right.\nAnd I'm looking forward to investor day. I feel great about the long-term. Four to six.\nThat doesn't mean I can predict it.\nTo a quarter or the specific year. But when I'm talking a three to five year time frame and do I believe that the market growth is going to be four to six, 100% confidence in that. The underlying scientific drivers, they're phenomenal in terms of our industry, what's going on in pipelines, in our customer base. Fantastic. Right. So I don't lose any sleep over that. And I always question it because it's important. It's not like, you know, just take it from a dogmatic standpoint, but from a fact and underlying drivers, I feel great about it.\nAnd then the other thing that's important to me, important to our 125,000 colleagues, and actually quite important to our investors is our customers meaningfully choosing us more often than their other choices. And the ability to grow 3% faster than the market I feel great about.\nWe have an incredible track record this quarter, at least looking at what we've seen so far, once again delivered on that. So hopefully that puts it in the context of my enthusiasm and will provide you transparency as the year wraps up. So what do we see as a reasonable assumption for the next year? I think our forecast accuracy is pretty good.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay.\nAnd Marc, if I can ask one more high-level follow-up, you know, over the years and in working with you and following Thermo, you know, one of the neat things has been in these, these tougher periods in the market, you know, Thermo and you specifically have, you know, you've played offense when others have played defense. Recognizing every cycle is difficult and different. I would say the last year and a half has been maybe tougher than normal even for Thermo as things start to improve a little bit. But again, it's gradual.\nDo you feel you're in a position now to maybe get even more aggressive like you have in previous cycles when it comes to capital deployment, evolving the business, and other initiatives? Are you feeling more comfortable, more confident in making those moves that we've seen in prior cycles?\nThank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nDoug, thanks for the question. When I think about the company's strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers over many, many years, you know, we're able to take a long-term perspective while holding ourselves accountable for delivering excellent short-term results. And I love periods where.\nNot everybody's performing at the same level. It creates opportunities. I love the fact that during the pandemic we were able to accelerate our investments in innovation. Wow. I mean, I talked probably for five of my 15 minutes today on innovation, and I had to truncate it because the list was so long. It is super cool. And our job is to differentiate our competitive position, deliver superior organic growth to the others, and translate into great results.\nAnd I'm very excited about our ability to continue to do that and further differentiate our industry leadership going forward. So thanks for the question, Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson. Tycho, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Hey Marc, a question on operating margins.\nOr maybe for Stephen, you know, lab products and services. Obviously you felt the headwinds from the vaccine and therapy roll off, but you know, it was effectively at a two-year low. So just curious about how you think about margins for lab products going forward. And then as we think about 2025, you know, if PPD and Patheon can grow above the corporate average, you know.\nDo you still have the ability to?\nDrive 40 to 50 basis points of margin expansion or potentially could it be higher or lower?\nThanks.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nTycho,\nThanks for the questions and good to hear from you again. So in terms of the margin profile in the quarter, we're going through largely the impact of the transition of the vaccine related capacity and sterile fill-finish translating into other modalities. That's probably the biggest factor that you see there. And I think about the margin profile for our businesses. I feel good about the ability to drive strong margin expansion.\nAs we know, the top line growth comes back and certain parts of our business where we've appropriately adjusted the cost base down, where volumes have come down and as volumes come back, we're going to get some good pull through that comes from that.\nSo.\nLook forward to giving the details on 2025 when we get to the January call. Yeah, in terms of the margin profile and kind of the mix of business, I feel good about the ability to expand our margins.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay.\nOne follow-up on CDMO capacity. You doubled fill-finish over the last couple years. Just curious, Marc, how you think about additional capacity expansion, how you think about capacity utilization in the industry, and, you know, how actively you may look at some of the capacity that could get freed up from some of the recent M&A or potentially around biosecure in the US.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So Tycho, when I think about our pharma services business and our capacity.\nWhere we play, I feel very good about our position. We've had very strong demand for our Sterile Fill-Finish capabilities, which is our largest activity and we're doing well there. We've been expanding the number of lines we have at our sites and demand has been strong for that. So I feel good about that outlook. In the clinical trials supplies, which is the other really large portion of our business and where we really have an unparalleled position, I highlighted a couple examples of capabilities we're expanding effectively.\nWe make sure that our capacity lines up with our forecasted demand so that it's not really an overcapacity viewpoint. And on the other parts of the business, I feel okay about our position and nothing of note there. So that's pretty positive.\nYou know, what we're going through right now, as a reminder, is we're transitioning a lot of the COVID-related activities to the normal therapies, and the team's doing a good job. It certainly impacts our growth in terms of headwind in 2024, but it becomes better in 2025 and 2026 as the new therapies and the tech transfers are complete and new lines come on pace. Pretty good times ahead.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks. I appreciate the color.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks Tycho.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks, Mark and Stephen. Thanks for taking the question. So, Mark, a higher-level question for you. Maybe with your, when you have conversation, the C-suite conversation with therapeutics teams out there, what are you seeing and hearing from your larger biopharma customers and maybe to some extent this mid-cap ones as well, versus the smaller and earlier stage customers. How much of a divergence are you seeing within these groups and when can that divergence narrow?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Puneet, thanks for the question. So when I think about.\nThe things that jump out to me, the patterns if you will, and I see lots of customers. I'm looking forward to being back on the road tomorrow, seeing our customers a great thing.\nIn our larger customers.\nThese would be the companies with many products that are both commercial and in their pipeline. You're seeing a few things. One, they're focused on, you know, resiliency of their supply chain. So where maybe historically pre-pandemic they would have had single-site in-house manufacturing, you're seeing much more of the second-site leveraging, you know, our capabilities. And that's great, right? In terms of just making sure that they can meet their customer demand, if you will, for medicines.\nYou're also seeing the desire for how do we help them be more innovative and productive? And you basically fund all of the exciting things in their pipeline by just helping them really prioritize the most important work and do that in the most effective way. So it's really about helping them do more to maximize the impact of what's in their pipeline.\nWhen I think about the smaller customers, because we had gone through a period in 2023 where funding was challenged, a lot of the tone was around how do they get through the period? When I think about the first six months of dialogue, much higher confidence, right. Funding is happening, but also the confidence that funding will be available really at a very different spot. And you're seeing that really translate into the earliest indicators of that, which is authorizations of new clinical trials and new activity.\nBut I would expect that that would sort of flow through the rest of the types of work we do as the year continues to unfold and as we get in 2025. So I think that's a very positive development.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nOkay, great. Just a follow-up for Stephen on the EPS beat. It was about $0.25 at the midpoint, but you raised the guide only by $0.10. So just wondering how much of that is a reflection of the end market versus what's within your control in terms of cost management or is there anything specific that you would point out too?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So $0.06 of the beating in Q2 is really timing related. When I think about the FX rates and kind of the outlook for the rest of the year, $0.03 of that $0.06 is going to be offset in the second half. And then from a tax standpoint, we're not assuming the change in the overall rate for the year. So that's timing with that. So that $0.06 is good beat in Q2, but it's net neutral for the year as a whole. And then with the rest, we've raised the low end $0.15 and we raised the high end $0.05, and I think that's a strong raise at this point.\nI think it's appropriate and enables us to be better positioned for the second half of the year. And I wouldn't really read anything else into that. It's just, I think that's just appropriate at this point.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nGot it.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nWe have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYeah. Our next question is from Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Arias",
    "content2": "Managing Director of Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Stifel\n\nThank you. Mark, where do you think the academic markets are headed here?\nThe mixed data points there.\nNIH budget isn't particularly robust this year. So, curious what expectations we should have?\nFor the second half and then into the next cycle.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, you know, I was encouraged by what I saw in, you know, academic and government in Q2. We had low single-digit growth, relatively challenging comparison. So those team did a good job. What I'm seeing is on the high end differentiated products, customers are getting money. I mean, if I think through, customers get money for the really great innovation and given our track record on innovation we're seeing strong demand for the Orbitrap Astral.\nAnd I know that there's a lot of excitement around the Thermo Scientific Stellar Mass Spectrometer and, you know, the Eclipse series. These are really recent series and these are really, really positive developments. And so I think it's good. I always think long-term academic and government globally, you know, is kind of a low single-digit growth market, sometimes a little better than that.\nAnd for our performance is playing out in line with that right now.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director of Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Stifel\n\nOkay. And then if I just have to follow up on your comments on China.\nStimulus and the ability to see money get spent there, do you see that as primarily just a function of time?\nCustomers need time to have it flow and get to them, or are there?\nSort of discrete triggers and specific things that need to happen in order to have demand actually make its way to you? Thanks.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, I mean the process is.\nThey have to apply, and there's central government funding and matched by their other funding sources, usually provincial or it could be local depending on the institution. So they're going through that process. As it gets approved, they then have the ability to go out and place the order. So that's the view. I think because these institutions are funded by the government at all times, whether it's stimulus or not, I think they have a mechanism to understand what's likely to happen. So this is not giant mystery to them.\nI think they're working through it, and it's kind of normal from that perspective, and what we're doing is reminding them of the importance of the, you know, the important instrumentation that we launched and the relevance of it so that they prioritize their funding request to support our instrumentation.\nDan, thanks for the question, and I'll turn to just wrapping up. So thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. You know, pleased to deliver another strong quarter, well positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and we'll build an even brighter future for our company. We're looking forward to talking about that bright future at our upcoming Investor Day on 19 September 2024 in New York and updating you on our third quarter performance in October.\nAs always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we had a great start to the year. We delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. I'm proud of our team's ongoing focus on enabling the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline, and our continued success as a result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System. So, let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.34 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.28 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin in Q1 to 22%, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 2% increase year over year to $5.11 per share.\nOur performance in the Q1 is allowing us to raise our guidance and sets us up to deliver differentiated performance in 2024. Turning to our performance by end market, in the Q1, underlying market conditions played out as we'd expected. Our team's excellent execution enabled us to deliver differentiated revenue performance that was ahead of our expectations. Now, let me provide you some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we declined in the low single digits for the quarter, which was a sequential improvement in performance over Q4 2023. In the Q1, the vaccine and therapy revenue runoff resulted in a three-point headwind for this customer segment, and we also delivered strong growth in our clinical research business. A quick reminder on academic and government, and industrial and applied.\nA year ago, we had very strong shipments of analytical instruments as we worked down the backlog that was caused by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. As a result, in academic and government, we declined in the low single digits during the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business as well as in our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we declined in the low single digits for the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business in this segment. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare in Q1, we declined in the high single digits. The reported growth in this end market was impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, core revenue growth was highlighted by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as our healthcare market channel.\nSo, wrapping up on our end markets, underlying market conditions played out as we expected to start the year. As you recall, our assumption for 2024 is that we'll see a modest pickup in economic activity as the year progresses. During the quarter, it was good to see a couple of positive developments in our end markets that support this view, including continued improvements in the biotech funding environment and the stimulus program announced by China. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, high-impact innovation. We had an excellent start to the year, launching a number of new products across our businesses during Q1.\nLet me first highlight a number of products in analytical instruments that demonstrate our continued market leadership. In our chromatography and mass spectrometry business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Dionex Inuvion Ion Chromatography System, which enables higher resolution, faster time to results, and streamlined workflows to more efficiently identify contaminants for environmental testing. In our chemical analysis business, we launched the Thermo Scientific LInspector Edge In-line Metrology Solution to enhance battery safety, performance, and production. We also launched the Thermo Scientific TruScan G3 Handheld Raman Analyzer, a next-generation handheld instrument for the rapid identification of chemical compounds used in drug production. Then in life science solutions, we launched the Axiom PangenomiX Array, a high-throughput microarray for use in human genomic studies across global populations, including disease risk and detection research as well as population-scale disease research programs. So, another strong quarter of product launches.\nOne other highlight of our high-impact innovation during the quarter was being named as one of Fast Company magazine's Most Innovative Companies. It's great external recognition for the impact that our team is driving for our customers. Moving to the second pillar of our strategy, we earned the trusted partner status over many years, and it gives me the unique opportunity to connect with our customers' senior executive teams. Since the beginning of the year, I've had many meetings with our customers, as they're turning to us more than ever. This is to both reinforce our partnership as well as to help them navigate the opportunities and challenges that they face. These conversations are happening across our company at all levels of the organization.\nOur customers see our team as part of theirs, and our culture of always finding a better way every day serves to reinforce our trusted partner status with our customers. We do not take lightly the trust our customers have in our company, and we'll continue to partner closely with them to enable their innovation and productivity. The first example of this is in our clinical next-generation sequencing business. In the quarter, we announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop a next-generation sequencing-based companion diagnostic that will help identify patients who may benefit from Bayer's growing portfolio of precision cancer therapies. The second example is our analytical instruments business. We are partnering with the North Carolina Collaboratory to support PFAS research capacity in the state as they help to identify and implement solutions to address PFAS contamination.\nThis is the first network of its kind, and they'll use several of our state-of-the-art instruments, including the Orbitrap Astral, in their research. And finally, in our clinical research business, I'll share two examples of how our trusted partner status comes to life as our customers look for solutions to their unmet needs. We expanded our portfolio of GMP lab services to include QPCR-based biosafety testing capabilities for the detection of bacteria and other contaminants in medicines. This offering enables significantly faster results versus traditional testing methods, allowing for quicker delivery of medicines to patients. And we launched the CorEvitas syndicated clinical registry in generalized pustular psoriasis to address an unmet need for real-world evidence related to outcomes for patients with this rare disease. As you recall, CorEvitas became part of our company last year.\nThe business is performing very well and making a difference for our customers and patients. All of these are great examples of our trusted partner status. Now, let me turn to our PPI business system, which enables outstanding execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. You can see it in our strong profitability and cash flow that we delivered in the Q1. Looking forward, our team is actively utilizing generative AI as part of the PPI business system to increase efficiency and productivity, as well as to continually improve the customer experience across the company. To share a couple of examples of how we're applying AI, it's enabling us to accelerate software development timelines in our analytical instruments and life science solutions businesses.\nWe're also leveraging the combination of large language models with a vast and differentiated amount of data at our disposal. One benefit we're seeing is our ability to enhance the capability of our technical and customer service teams to more effectively serve our customers. Generative AI is another great example of how we continually strengthen the impact of the PPI business system. Let me now give you an update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities, being a good steward of our planet, and focusing on STEM education and advancing global health equity. To that end, during Q1, we announced a collaboration with the South African Medical Research Council.\nTogether, we'll establish a center of excellence and training program focused on molecular biology and life sciences. The facility will provide specialized education and support for professional development to scientists and laboratory professionals in Africa. I'm also pleased to share that Thermo Fisher achieved a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index for the eighth year in a row. Let me now give you an update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we reached the one-year anniversary of the Binding Site acquisition, now our protein diagnostics business. Its financial performance is tracking ahead of the deal model with really strong growth.\nI recently had the chance to visit the headquarters of our protein diagnostics business and saw the great progress they're making, given the exciting new products that can positively impact patient care for multiple myeloma. Turning to our planned acquisition of Olink, we're working through the regulatory process, and the transaction is on track to close by mid-2024. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to the company later this year. In terms of return of capital during the quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of shares and increased our dividend by 11%. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished and grateful for their contributions to our success. In a nice recognition of both our team and track record, Thermo Fisher has once again been included on Fortune Magazine's list of Most Admired Companies. Let me now turn to our guidance.\nGiven the stronger operational performance to start the year, we are raising our 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.3 to 43.3 billion, and we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.14 to 22.02 per share. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So, to summarize our key takeaways from the Q1, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. We continue to enable our customer success, and this continually reinforces our trusted partner status. Our strong results in Q1 position us to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Thanks, Marc.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nCFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nAnd good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our Q1 results for the total company, then provide color on our four business segments, and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view on how the Q1 played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. In Q1, market conditions were as we'd expected. We had another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q1 financials meaningfully ahead of what we'd assumed in our prior guidance. Core organic revenue was $150 million, or 1.5% ahead, and adjusted EPS was $0.40 ahead.\nTo give you some color on that $0.40, $0.19 was from very strong profitability pull-through on the revenue beat, $0.12 was from phasing of spending within the year, $0.07 was from lower FX headwinds, and $0.02 was from lower net interest expense. So, we're continuing to manage the business really well and after a great start to the year. Let me now provide you with some additional details in our performance, beginning with earnings per share. In the quarter, we grew Adjusted EPS by 2% to $5.11. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.46, up 4% from Q1 last year. On the top line in Q1, reported revenue was 3% lower year over year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue change included 4% lower organic revenue and a slight contribution from acquisitions. Q1 core organic revenue decreased 3%.\nIn the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $200 million, including $175 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, in Q1, North America declined mid-single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia-Pacific and China declined in the low single digits. With respect to our operational performance, the team used the PPI business system to execute really well in the quarter, delivering $2.3 billion of adjusted operating income, which was 22% of revenue, 20 basis points higher than Q1 last year. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.8%, 150 basis points higher than Q1 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver very strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management as well as the carryover benefits from the cost actions put in place last year.\nThis enabled us to more than offset the impact of lower volumes while appropriately funding investments to further advance our industry leadership. Moving to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.5% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $330 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investment in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 7.2% in the quarter. Looking at results below the line, our Q1 net interest expense was $84 million, which is $70 million lower than Q1 2023 due to increased cash balances. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10.5%. Average diluted shares were $384 million in Q1, approximately $4 million lower year over year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to free cash flow and the balance sheet, we had a strong start to the year with cash flow generation.\nQ1 cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and free cash flow for Q1 was $910 million after investing $340 million of net capital expenditures. We continued to return capital to shareholders in Q1 with an 11% increase in our dividend and the $3 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January. We ended the quarter with $7.25 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.6 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3x gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA and 2.6x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.8%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we've been generating across the company. Now, I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, starting with life sciences solutions.\nQ1 reported revenue in this segment declined 13%, and organic revenue was 12% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven by moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment, as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year-ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income for life science solutions increased 1%, and adjusted operating margin was 36.8%, up 480 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q1, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team continues to do an excellent job to appropriately manage the cost base and deal with the unwind of the pandemic. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue declined 2%, and organic growth was 1% lower than the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver very strong growth in the electron microscopy business.\nAs a reminder, we had very strong comparisons in this segment in the quarter due to the high level of instrument shipments in Q1 last year as we worked down the backlog. In this segment, Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 70 basis points lower year over year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics, in Q1, reported revenue and organic revenue were flat versus the prior year quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as in our healthcare market channel. Q1 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, which is 120 basis points higher than Q1 2023.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered favorable business mix and good productivity, which was partially offset by strategic investments. And finally, in the biology products and biopharma services segment, both reported revenue and organic growth decreased 1% in Q1 versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue. During the quarter, we delivered strong growth in our clinical research business. Q1 adjusted operating income declined 6%, and adjusted operating margin was 13%, which is 80 basis points lower than Q1 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance, as Marc outlined, given the strong start to the year, we're raising our 2024 full-year guidance.\nWe now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.3 to 43.3 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.14 to 22.02. At the midpoint, that reflects a core revenue increase of just under $100 million. We continue to assume core organic revenue growth will be in the range of -1% to +1% for 2024. We continue to assume that the market declines low single digits this year. Our growth strategy and PPI business system execution will enable us to continue to take share once again. In terms of adjusted EPS, the increase in the guidance at the midpoint is just over $0.10. The majority of this is from the core revenue raise, and it's also $0.02 from assumed lower net interest expense versus our prior guidance.\nOur 2024 updated guidance range assumes an adjusted operating income margin between 22.4% and 22.8%, slightly improved from the prior guide. We continue to use the PPI business system to enable excellent execution, manage costs appropriately, and fund the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. So, a great start to the year and increase in the guidance outlook. We remain well-positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. I thought it'd be helpful to remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 to 400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 to 1.4 billion, or 3% of revenue.\nWe assume that FX will be roughly neutral year over year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. Given recent FX rate changes, we're assuming that the $0.07 beat that we saw in Q1 is offset in the remainder of the year, leading to no change for the year as a whole for FX versus our prior guide. We expect the adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024, and we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 to 7 billion. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January. We expect to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we continue to assume that we'll close the Olink acquisition by mid-year.\nFull-year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. Finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing. In Q2, we expect revenue dollars to step up from the Q1, and organic growth will likely be two points better than Q1. We expect Q2 adjusted EPS to be similar to Q1. This reflects the revised view of the phasing of spending within the year that I mentioned earlier. I think this view of Q2 is pretty close to what's currently baked into consensus right now. So, to conclude, we delivered on our commitments in Q1, and we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nOperator, who's ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Tejada. As a reminder, everyone, if you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad now. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two. In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher Management Team, please limit your time on the call to one question and only one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. We'll pause here briefly as the questioner registered. We have the first question from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Simply put, it was a better start than expected to the year. Marc, can you share color on one, how did the quarter progress? And two, how does that progression and really momentum heading into Q2, how do those things inform your thinking on the outlook for the balance of the year?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, thanks. So, I thought, just in the spirit of continuous improvement in PPI, that I would frame a few of the key points for the Q&A session and then get to your question. So, indulge me for a second. So, when I think about the key points, one, I will start with the long term. We serve an awesome industry that has a bright future, right? And when you think about what drives the bright future, very durable growth given by the great science, the strong pipelines, and the unmet medical needs. When I think about Q1, zooming into the short term, market conditions were in line with our expectations.\nReally, it was strong execution in the quarter that resulted in the financial performance that was ahead of our expectations. It allowed us to retire risk as well as raise our full-year outlook. Reminding our investors, what's assumed in the 2024 guidance is that we're going to see a modest step up or pickup in economic activity as the year progresses. During the quarter, it was really good to see a couple of positive developments in our end markets that supports the view of a pickup as the year progresses, which is continued improvements in the biotech funding environment and the stimulus program that was announced by China. As you know, how we define success is that we deliver differentiated short-term performance with a strong emphasis on share gain while strengthening our competitive position for the long term. Q1 was another quarter in which we achieved that.\nSo, Doug, as I think about the phasing of the quarter, market really played out exactly as we thought it was. And we looked at the different parts of it, and really, in aggregate, and in the pieces, it really played out that way. As the quarter unfolded, what I would say is, didn't see a huge change in pattern, although March was a little bit better than the first couple of months. You had the way Easter laid out, which kind of makes it a little bit hard to know exactly, but it felt like March was a good exit rate consistent with the modest step up. And that's baked into it. And I would say that April is, in the first couple of weeks, kind of playing out with that as well.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's super helpful. And thank you for the high-level thoughts as well. If I could maybe just kind of double-click into an area of focus for all of us, lab products and services was stronger than expected relative to certainly what I had in my model and from what I can tell was in consensus. In particular, obviously, the CRO and the CDMO businesses are a focus for all of us. What are you seeing there? Is it fair to say that things are picking up there a little bit better and maybe better than expected, keeping in mind that some of the early updates from CDMO peers have been relatively encouraging? I think maybe more on the CRO side is where we'd see this impact.\nBut as we kind of keep it in mind that Q1 was the best biopharma funding quarter in about five years, how does that make you feel about the outlook for the next several quarters and the years ahead?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nCFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYes, Doug, I'll tee up the kind of the view versus consensus first. And I'm not going to talk about the kind of business dynamics. So, we don't guide by segment in terms of our organic growth. And for us, it came in, as Marc said, the markets came in as we'd expected in aggregate. And that's the same thing for the segments. And we executed well. So, it wasn't a huge outperformance, part of the beat that was kind of pretty much across the board for the company. Yeah.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nAnd then when you get into the dynamics, the one thing I would call out is in our CRO capabilities, clinical research, the former PPD business. Really excellent execution in the Q1 drove really very strong performance. Very proud of what the team accomplished. And when I think about the market dynamics, definitely seeing the pipeline of activity picking up. And as you certainly know, it takes a while for that to actually materialize into revenue just given the cycle of the business, but very encouraging given the biotech funding environment to see that level of pipeline of work picking up. So, thank you, Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Marc, I want to pick up on something you just mentioned. You called out continued improvement in biotech funding environment. Earlier, you talked about the stimulus in China, two positive developments you saw in the end market in Q1. But I think you also acknowledge it's still relatively early going for those. There have been a few false starts in end markets over the course of 2023. So, I guess the question is, what gives you confidence that these have really turned the corner? What data points are you looking for as the year progresses? And especially given your position on the China Business Council, just when do you think the better funding and stimulus will show up as revenues for you for Thermo?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Mike, I think it's a great question. I like the way you framed it as well. So, nothing about false starts.The way that I think about it is, and super clear on the word choice, what was assumed in our original guidance was a modest pickup. The two data points that I called out would be consistent with that view. So, we're not changing our view upwards on the market, but rather what's going to drive the slight pickup, the fact that biotech funding is improving and that China announced a stimulus program. I think everybody was probably positively surprised that they announced it as early in the year as that they did. And they're trying to get their economy growing. Those are good facts to support the modest step up, and set ourselves up for an even stronger set of market conditions as we enter 2025. So, that's how I think about kind of the phasing of what's going on in the market.\nAnd then the other thing that I wouldn't just note about the quarter, which was very positive, is that it actually played out as we expected, right, including the four end markets. And that's good because, I mean, the normal incredible visibility and predictability that you typically have in this business is returning, which is helpful as well.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. That's really helpful. And Doug asked about lab products and services. Let me focus on analytical instruments. You called out electron microscopy, continuing to do very well there. And you do have really tough comps. But maybe you could focus a little bit on chromatography, mass spec. What are you seeing there from an end market perspective? There's been a lot of concern about pharma, CapEx budgets, and sort of how they're trending in 2024. So, any early comments you can say about that part of the portfolio? Thanks.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Mike, when I think about analytical instruments, we had a really good quarter. It's against a very, very strong comparison, which is why I called it out because compared to the high-teens growth last year, it's important to flag it. Let me start with electron microscopy, then I'll get to chroma, mass spec. So, electron microscopy, that business has been performing at a great level, continues to have a strong order book, and is just doing a really good job. I feel great about that. When I think about chromatography and mass spectrometry, they as well have incredibly strong comparisons. We're getting really good uptake on the Astral and really have had some milestone level of shipments on that product over the first nine months of launching it. So, that's gone well.\nMost of our business is in the high-end research portion, which has done well for us. We have a little bit less exposure to kind of the more routine applications. I did flag one product that we launched, which is really quite relevant, as you know, with a very strong market leader in chromatography. You hear a lot about PFAS testing, things of this sort. And we launched the next generation of instrumentation there, which is great just given how large our fleet is around the world. And that product is off to a great start. So, I feel good about the outlook for the different pieces.\nAnd I highlighted a couple of interesting launches in chemical analysis, the smallest of the three businesses where we're enabling battery production and really trying to change the way that QAQC is done in pharmaceutical manufacturing by having raw materials inspected at the factory versus doing lab testing. And the handheld Raman analyzer does that. So, really great innovation, drives growth in the business, and a really good performance to start the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nChartered Financial Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGood morning, guys. I wanted to keep digging in on the pharma businesses here. So, the first question is on clinical research. You called out strong growth. Just a clarification, is this inclusive of the COVID headwinds you've talked about before? The tone sounds more positive. Any comments around what you're seeing would be great.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYes. There's no adjustments to any of that. It's just business just grew through that. When I think about the year, when I think about the guidance, that the assumptions are better than the guidance, we reminded our investors that we had the largest role in clinical research on supporting the pandemic response. We also had, in parallel, incredible growth in the business and really just an excellent start and excellent execution to deliver strong growth in the quarter. While we expect this business will moderate this year relative to the last few years, just the momentum it has bodes extremely well for the midterm of high single-digit growth business plus synergy. So, the team has done a great job of becoming part of the company, leveraging our relationships, and getting really strong commercial momentum. So, really nice start to the year.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nChartered Financial Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nAwesome. And then on the pharma services side, there's been a little bit of a competitive shake-up with Novo Nordisk's proposed acquisition of Catalent. Can you just talk about your win rate for Patheon and how you feel about the runway for future tech transfers?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Jack, when I think about pharma services, the business has performed very well. And when I think about the industry dynamics that have gone on in an area that we're the market leader, sterile fill-finish, where we put the medicine or vaccine in its final dosage form, effectively, you have one of the pure play competitors being taken out of the CDMO business effectively or less so. And that in an area where capacity is constrained already, it bodes really well for our business as the market leader and great reputation. Our activity level is high.\nThe number of dialogues we're having with our customers is high. We're securing new business. So, I feel great about it. Our job as the trusted partner is to enable our customer success, right? Our customers think in decades in this industry. When there's events that make them uncertain, whether it's biosecure or whether it's an acquisition of one of the suppliers, they look at the industry leader and say, This is a company that doesn't create uncertainty and does a great job. Those things ultimately allow us to better support our customers going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. So, I wanted to dig into the comments around China stimulus a little bit more.Just on one hand, the language around the stimulus is fairly broad, but this tranche also appears to be two and a half times the dollar amount of the stimulus package that benefited last year. So, can you walk us through what are you hearing from customers regarding this stimulus? Are you working on proposals with customers yet, or have you even seen any orders related to that stimulus come through? Albeit, it's probably a bit early for that.\nAnd then just to follow up on those comments around the timeline for stimulus, if we look at what happened last year, the stimulus was actually announced in September 2022, but we really didn't see an impact until early 2023. So, just given that delay between initial announcement and actually seeing the benefit, in your view, could we potentially see the benefit this year, or could this ultimately be a 2025 dynamic?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, Rachel, thanks for the question. I share the enthusiasm about the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, get things going. So, it's an interesting time in that respect. So, anybody just to jump in.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nCFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nI want to go back to Mike's comment about the view on, is this a start, the start, post-start? I think it's a good thing that China is trying to find ways to stimulate the economy. And I think this is one element of it. And we look forward to other things happening as well in terms of just the way that China is managing the economy. Marc, sorry, go ahead. Yeah, yeah.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, when I think about actually the way things play out, and a lot of this is about signaling, as far as I can tell from my own experience of working in China for many years, it's a multi-year program as opposed to the last one, which was shorter term. So, basically, the government is signaling, at least to the economy, that they're looking for investments in instrumentation equipment, technological advances, advanced research. So, that's very encouraging in terms of that it's not a short-term program, but rather longer term. And yes, we've already had proposals in front of customers. And yes, there's quite a bit of dialogue. Customers are actually waiting for some of the very practical details of how this will work because it varies by province ultimately. So, to my knowledge, no orders yet. I wouldn't expect any of that quickly anyway, but lots of activity.\nThe way that I would think about this is there's the direct effect and then the indirect effect. I would expect that we would see orders really later in the year and some revenue late in the year directly associated with the stimulus. But that may miss by a few months one way or the other. So, I wouldn't expect material shipments in Q2 around this. That would be the way I would think about my experience. The indirect effect, it's a confidence booster, right, which is basically saying the government's going to try to get the economy up and going. And that should help more broadly. And that doesn't help tomorrow, but it helps from a contextual standpoint of business confidence.\nSo, I think those things would say that you're seeing China try to get the economy growing. We're not assuming a lot in China in our numbers this year in terms of major changes. So, what I'm most excited about there is that it sets up for 2025. Not that we won't see a benefit this year, but it's kind of a direction of travel. And our view is longer-term China should be a good growth market for us.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. Really appreciate all that detail. I just wanted to stick on China for my follow-up then. Obviously, we've seen some of these headlines run via Biosecure Act. We've heard some of your customers talking about trying to de-risk some of their supply chains and go with more Western manufacturers, just given where we're at from that headline perspective. So, I wanted to see how has that been impacting your customer conversation? Have you seen any increase in inbounds in terms of Patheon?\nAnd then just from a timing, if you were to benefit from this, obviously a pretty capacity-constrained sector right now. I know you mentioned some of the Catalent and Novo dynamics earlier as well. Could you even benefit in the near term from any competitive wins relating to biosecure, or is it just a function of capacity constraints? This really alludes to the value chain and the vertical integration that Thermo has, but would be more of a benefit longer term. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, the way that I think about biosecure is I kind of put it into the context of there's a level of geopolitical tensions that exist around the world, including between the US and China. It's never exactly clear whether these things become enacted or not. It's our job to help our customers navigate those shifting landscapes.\nI think at the highest level, actually, relations are falling between the countries a bit. There'll always be challenges. When I think about how this could play out, should it play out, I think that what is making the customer base that's largely Western in terms of where biotech and pharmaceutical activity is largely is think more about their supply chains, who's doing development work, etc. Given our network is effectively 100% in US and Western Europe and that set of capabilities, we're likely to be a long-term beneficiary, not per se of the act, but rather the fact that customers are thinking about who are their partners and where should those partners be based. So, I think that's a long-term should be okay. And I don't think it has any material impact to the results in the short term. Thank you, Rachel.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director of Research, Health Care, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks for the questions, Marc and Stephen. Maybe just on China, I know there's already been some discussion points here, Marc, but could you just give us a sense how the low single-digit decline in the quarter kind of compared expectations and just remind us what to assume for the full year and kind of any color you can share about just demand trends across your business segments in China?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, when I think about China, that actually played out as we expected. The team delivered on the expectations for the quarter. As you know, our guidance, we don't guide by geography or by business. It's really the aggregate of it all. But actually, the Q1 played out as the team expected, and they executed well. When you kind of go down into the subsegments of China, now you get into the tiny portions of our revenue, nothing really significant of note in terms of things better or worse than what we've been seeing or what we would expect.\nSo, that would be my high level. We are looking forward to returning to China early in the summer, so get some firsthand perspectives on that as well.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director of Research, Health Care, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. And then maybe just on pharma services, I know the consumable portion of your business, Mark, is call it 10% or so of revenues, but now there's obviously tremendous focus there right now. Could you give any color on how that business performed in the quarter and any color you can provide on this ongoing destock issue, whether or not you've seen orders start to grow again sequentially? Thanks.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Dan, thanks for the question on bio production. It's definitely a factor where it got in the queue of the questions. It says that the emphasis is reducing on that, so it's becoming a little bit more predictable. Really, Q1 was in line with expectations. Organic growth did decline as we expected in the quarter due to the strong comparisons from a year ago. But when I look at orders, that's now two quarters in a row with really good sequential bookings growth, nice improvement in book to bill.\nAnd when I look at the things that have been said externally about the quarter, I feel really good about our performance in terms of how we executed. So, working out in line with what we thought would happen. Thanks, Dan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just revisiting the AI segment and maybe just compare and contrast the end markets and where you're seeing some of the greatest strengths. Sounds like industrial applied remains strong, but just would love to hear you kind of go through biopharma, applied industrial, and academic government and sort of the phasing of growth over the course of this year in those end markets for AI. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSure. So, when I think about the business, one of the things, Matt, is we really don't manage it by end segment because effectively you produce a certain amount of products, and then you ship them to specific customers. So, you can have quarters where you ship more to an industrial customer the exact same product as a biopharma customer, and therefore it kind of skews things. So, that's my caveat around that.\nBut when I look at the parts of the business, the industrial and applied continues to have strong momentum in semiconductor material science applications for electron microscopy was strong. So, in terms of how that played out, very difficult comparisons for all of the businesses based on the shipments a year ago, but that was strong. And then the other segments in terms of academic, government, pharma, and biotech pretty much played out as we expected. So, nothing that really jumped out at me as being significant in terms of trends or patterns.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. And then just for my follow-up, just on LPS and the margins, I know when you had acquired PBD, you talked about potential for long-term margin expansion in that business. Could you just maybe talk about some of the levers you've got within LPS, understanding that revenue improvement would help a lot, but just any levers to get that margin within LPS to expand that over time?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nI'll start, and then maybe Stephen will add a few additional thoughts. So, when I think about margins, and obviously you have different businesses there, the clinical research business, formerly PPD, incredibly strong operational execution, right? So, when you actually look at utilization rates, modifications, all of the things that ultimately drive margins, they're doing a great job and executing really well. We're obviously benefiting from the synergies that we outlined, and we will have achieved all of our synergy targets on the cost side. So, that's gone well. And so, they're really doing a great job of executing the trials really well, and that bodes well for margin expansion along with volume.\nWhen I think about pharma services, the underlying is very strong, but we obviously have a capacity coming online and also the runoff of the COVID revenue. So, when you lose the volume, you see short-term pressure on margins. But if I say how is the team operating, actually the team's operating well. So, the margins there will expand as the year progresses and into the future as well. So, that would be my thoughts about margins, but I don't know, Stephen, anything else?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nCFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, I think on the pharma services side, it's the capacity coming online and switching over. There's cost to do that. And as you're ramping up the facility, bringing on the colleagues to be able to operate that facility, those are all factors that come into that, but those are the right drivers.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Matt. And operator, we have time for one more question. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question we have time for today is from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLuke Sergott\n\nDirector of Healthcare Equity Research, Barclays",
    "content2": "Great. Thanks for the question. So, I want to dig back into the Biosecure Act and follow up on what Rachel was asking about. But I wanted to know, Marc, what you guys are hearing from your customers and multinationals that operate over there and what they're saying to you regarding their assumptions on China retaliating and maybe excluding them from the region. I know it seems pretty unlikely and it's probably going to be limited, but is this something that is on their radar or some of those conversations that you're having?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. I can't really speculate on whether this thing will even come to pass. And if it comes to pass, what is the response to it? Our job is to do a great job of supporting our customers globally to comply with the global regulations, both the actual regulations and the spirit of the regulations of the various countries. And we'll do a good job navigating it. So, that's how I would think about it.\n\nLuke Sergott\n\nDirector of Healthcare Equity Research, Barclays\n\nYeah. Okay. And then, Stephen, for you on the life science margins, so very, very strong here from Life Science Solutions. I understand that the destocking is less of an issue, but how much of this step up in the quarter was from the restocking? Just kind of walk through and double-click on the drivers there. And should we consider this as kind of the jump-off point or it'll be around this range for the rest of the year or anything from a modeling perspective?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nCFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, Luke, that really good margin profile in the segment, and it's really about addressing the cost base in that business given the low volumes, both from the pandemic unwind and kind of the bio production aspect to it. So, it's really just fundamentally addressing the costs that we have in that business. Team's done a great job of doing that, and that's the way to think about that.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, thank you, Luke, and thanks everyone for the questions. Let me wrap up. Very pleased to deliver a very strong quarter. Incredibly well-positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, build an even brighter future for our company. I look forward to updating you on our second quarter results in July and discussing our very bright future as well as outlook at our upcoming investor day on 19 September. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your line."

So with that, I'll now turn the. Call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. As you saw in our press release, our fourth quarter results were ahead of the guidance we provided on our call in October and demonstrate strong execution. As I reflect on our performance for the full year, I'm very proud of our team as they operated with speed at scale to enable the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong operational discipline and commercial execution. In 2023 we delivered differentiated short-term performance while at the same time strengthening our long-term competitive position. I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first let me recap the financials.\nStarting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.89 billion, our adjusted operating income was $2.55 billion, we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points to 23.4%, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 5% to $5.67 per share. Then, in terms of our full year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2023, adjusted operating income was $9.81 billion, and adjusted EPS was $21.55 per share. Last year we once again delivered meaningful share gain with our industry-leading products, services, and expertise. We leveraged our PPI Business System to enable outstanding execution including aggressively addressing our cost base to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we strengthened our long-term competitive position with high-impact innovation and exciting and complementary acquisitions, additional investments in our capabilities, and further strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers.\nTurning to our performance by end market in the fourth quarter, underlying market conditions largely played out in line with our expectations. Our continued strong execution resulted in revenue performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations. Now let me provide you some color on our performance in the context of each of our end markets starting with and biotech. As expected, growth declined in the high single digits for the quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. In 2023, vaccine and therapy runoff resulted in a 7-point headwind in this customer segment, which was effectively offset through share gains. As a result of our trusted partner status, we've made strong progress in transitioning COVID-related capacity to other therapies, and that's very exciting for the future.\nIn academic and government, we grew in the mid single digits for the quarter and in high single digits for the full year. In 2023 we delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses including electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry as well as the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. During the year we delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy business and finally in diagnostics and Healthcare. In Q4, revenue declined in the high teens and was 30% lower for the full year. In 2023, we delivered good core business growth in this end market highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology, and transplant diagnostic businesses.\nI'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another terrific year of high impact innovation. Throughout the year, we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work in chromatography and mass spectrometry. The year was highlighted by the launch of the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer, which is helping our customers uncover proteins that were previously undetectable. The scientific breakthrough is enabling customers to advance precision medicine, including the identification of new clinical biomarkers. In the six months since launch, the scientific community's adoption of the product has exceeded our high expectations, and the momentum is continuing to build as we enter 2024.\nIn electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 STEM, a fully automated system that enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to advanced development. In specialty diagnostics, we launched the first FDA-cleared assays for the risk assessment and clinical management of pre-eclampsia. This first-of-a-kind diagnostic has received significant attention and adoption as it has significantly raised the standard of care for pregnant women, helping physicians to better manage care by predicting who is most at risk for this condition. In life sciences solutions, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next-generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. We continued this great innovation momentum in Q4.\nIn electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Meridian EX System for precise defect localization in advanced logic semiconductors, and in laboratory products, we launched the Thermo Scientific Aquanex Ultrapure Water Purification System for reliable water purity and operational enhancement in laboratories. So another spectacular year of innovation and an exciting pipeline for the future. In 2023, we also continue to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we have earned with our customers. This included the opening of a state-of-the-art Customer Center of Excellence in Milan to showcase our industry-leading product, services, and expertise. During the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our position in advanced materials by opening a Customer Experience Center for battery manufacturing in Seoul to accelerate the development of next-generation environmentally friendly energy solutions.\nWe also made significant advancements in the partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year, building on our long-standing relationship with Boehringer Ingelheim. A great example in Q4 was an exciting opportunity to develop a genomic testing-based companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer patients in Japan and the United States, where lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death.\nNow let me turn to our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture which continue to enable successful execution during the year. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. It's helping us to drive, share, gain, improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance. I'm proud of the way our team leveraged PPI to step up in an agile way to navigate the dynamic environment last year, driving higher commercial intensity, actively managing our cost base, and optimizing sourcing. We're also leveraging generative AI as part of our PPI Business System toolkit and to increase productivity, further optimize our commercial effectiveness, and improve the customer experience.\nA quick recap on capital deployment. Last year we continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we completed our acquisition of The Binding Site, our Protein Diagnostics business, which enhances our specialty diagnostics offering by advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and other immune disorders. The integration has gone smoothly, and the business is performing extremely well and tracking ahead of the deal model. As we look to the future of the protein diagnostics business, our launch of EXENT Instrument Solution represents a significant breakthrough given its enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use when compared to conventional methods.\nThis is a great complement to our Freelite assays and their strong interest from the medical community due to the positive impact on diagnosing multiple myeloma patients. In the third quarter we added CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real world evidence for approved medicines, and therapies. CorEvitas is now integrated into our clinical research business and customers are seeing the benefit of these additional capabilities. The business is off to a great start and performing very well. During the fourth quarter we announced our intent to acquire Olink, a provider of advanced proteomics solutions that help researchers to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. As a reminder, Olink's technology complements our leading mass spectrometry and life science platforms, and we are uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers.\nThe transaction is on track to be completed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals in 2023. We also returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.\nLet me now give you a brief.\nUpdate on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet, and I'm proud of the actions we took in 2023 in this regard. Building on the environmental sustainability initiatives, we continue to accelerate our transition to renewable energy with on-site solar projects and power purchase agreements around the world. This progress will help us achieve our recently established target of utilizing 80% renewable electricity globally by 2030 to advance global health equity. In Q4, we announced a partnership with Project HOPE to improve the well-being and treatment outcomes for young people living with HIV in Nigeria, the country with the second largest HIV epidemic worldwide.\nThroughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was once again recognized for our industry leadership and inclusive culture where colleagues can have a mission-driven career. To list just a few of the recognitions, we were once again included on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies as well as Fortune's inaugural list of most innovative companies. Newsweek named us as one of America's most responsible companies. Forbes included us on its list of the world's top companies for women and named us as one of the best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. Thanks to our incredible colleagues, we successfully navigated the environment, continues to build a bright future for our company. I'm very excited about 2024 and beyond.\nSo let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our 2024 revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 to 43.3 billion and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22 per share. This outlook reflects a continuation of us demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution, operational discipline, and enabling the success of our customers. I've had the opportunity to connect with many of our customers in January to understand what's on their minds. Based on our long-standing relationships, we have terrific access to the senior executive teams of our customers. From these conversations, it's clear to me that our customers value our partnership and see us as essential to enabling their success.\nThey are enthusiastic for the future because of the progress and pipelines to treat disease, and there's also great enthusiasm with material science customers for the important advances made in those fields. All of this will create strong long-term demand for our capabilities as we enable customer scientific breakthroughs, and we continue to be incredibly well positioned to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. So, to summarize our key takeaways for 2023, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. We continue to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationship with many customers. Last year and this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, delivered differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year, helping us to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment.\nWe're well positioned in 2024 to once again deliver differentiated short-term performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO Stephen Williamson. Stephen,\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nthanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we executed really well in Q4. Market conditions played out largely as we'd expected in the quarter, and through great execution we delivered 1% more core organic revenue.\nGrowth than our prior guidelines.\nIn terms of adjusted EPS, we beat our prior guide by $0.05 and that included offsetting $0.08 of additional FX headwind. So really strong operational execution in the quarter. We also capped off the year with very strong free cash flow, delivering $7 billion in 2023. Throughout the year, we navigated the changing macro environment very effectively. Our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System enabled us to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers, differentiated financial results for our shareholders, all while continuing to invest in the business and advance our strategic position as the world leader in serving science. Let me now provide you some additional details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. We delivered $5.67 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $21.55 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.20 and $15.45 for the full year.\nOn the top line, reported revenue was 5% lower year over year in Q4. The components of our Q4 reported revenue change included 7% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange. Q4 core organic revenue decreased 4%, for the full year 2023 reported and organic revenue decreased 5%, and core organic revenue.\nGrowth for the year was 1%.\nIn 2023 we delivered $1.73 billion of pandemic-related revenue, $330 million of testing, and $1.4 billion of vaccines and therapies revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the quarter. In the current year and prior year in Q4, North America declined low double digits, Europe declined low single digits, Asia Pacific grew low single digits with China declining in the mid single digits. For the full year, North America declined high single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia Pacific declined low single digits with China declining high single digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.55 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, 100 basis points higher than Q4 last year.\nIn the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptionally strong productivity and achieve good price realization. This is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, strategic investments, and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI Business System. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 22.9%. In line with our prior guide, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.5%, 10 basis points higher than Q4 last year. The change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.2%.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.1% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.2% of revenue, an improvement of 60 basis points compared to 2022. Total R&D expense was $328 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.35 billion, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.8% in 2023. Looking at results below the line, our Q4 net interest expense was $81 million, which is $38 million lower than Q4 2022. Net interest expense for the full year was $495 million, an increase of $41 million year over year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $19 million, $9 million higher than Q4 2022.\nThis is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX for the full year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense of $16 million compared to a net income of $14 million in 2022. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter and for the full year was 10%. This was 280 basis points lower than Q4 last year and 300 basis points lower for the full year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities.\nAverage diluted shares were 388 million in Q4, approximately 5 million lower year over year, driven by share repurchases net of options, and shortly after the year-end, in January 2024, we repurchased $3 billion of shares.\nTurning to cash flow and the balance sheet, full-year cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion, and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow was $7 billion. After investing $1.4 billion of net capital expenditures, we returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in Q4 and $523 million for the full year. During the year, we invested $3.7 billion on completed acquisitions and committed $3.1 billion.\nTo the acquisition of Olink, which we.\nExpect to close by mid 2024. We ended the quarter with $8.1 billion in cash and $34.9 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5x on.\nA net debt basis.\nIncluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12% reflecting the strong returns on investment that we have across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year, so that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. In 2023, we continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 19%, and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter.\nThis was driven by the runoff of our pandemic-related revenue in the segments, as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported organic revenue was 26% lower than 2022. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Science Solutions decreased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 36.2%, up 210 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team's done an excellent job appropriately managing the cost base and dealing with the unwind of the pandemic. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 39%, and adjusted operating margin was 34.3%.\nIn the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 10% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 28.8% up 340 basis points. Year over year in the quarter we delivered strong productivity and volume pull through which was partially offset by FX and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%, an increase of 350 basis points versus the prior year.\nTurning to specialty diagnostics in Q4, reported revenue declined 1% and organic revenue was 7% lower than the prior year. In Q4 we continue to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our transplant diagnostics, microbiology, and immunodiagnostics businesses. This is offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue was down 13%. Q4 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 27% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, which is 530 basis points higher than Q4 2022. In Q4 we delivered strong productivity and favorable business mix, which was partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. The full year adjusted operating income was 10% higher than 2022 and adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, an increase of 400 basis points versus 2022.\nFinally, in the laboratory products and biopharma services segments, Q4 reported revenue decreased 4% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue and the phasing of revenue in our pharma services business within 2023. As had been expected for the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 2% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is 10 basis points lower than Q4 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 17% higher than the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 180 basis points versus 2022.\nLet me now turn to guidance, and as Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion. Adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22. Our guidance assumes core organic revenue growth in the range of -1% to 1% for 2024. Our view on the expected market conditions in 2024 has not changed significantly from our initial framing for the year shared on the last earnings call. We're assuming that the market declines in the low single digits this year. Our growth strategy and PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again this year. Our current estimate of pandemic related revenue in 2024 is just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 to $400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue.\nIn total, this represents a year over year headwind of $1.3 to 1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. MA is expected to increase revenue by $175 million year over year. The combination of six months of Olink revenue and the inorganic portion of core CorEvitas revenue in 2024. At current rates, we expect FX to be neutral year over year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. From a phasing standpoint, FX is expected to be a slight headwind in Q1 and an offsetting tailwind in the second half. Turning to margins, our 2024 guidance range assumes adjusted operating income margins between 22.3% and 22.8%. We continue to aggressively manage our cost base, and that's reflected in this margin outlook. In terms of the range for the margins, that's driven by the revenue range that I provided.\nWe'll continue to use the PPI Business System to not only manage costs very carefully, but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls, including the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year, are expected to largely offset the runoff in the remaining pandemic-related activities, revenue inflation, and the normalization of incentive compensation across the company. To appropriately invest in our colleagues below the line, we expect approximately $430 million of net interest expense in 2024 and expect adjusted other income and expense to.\nNet close to zero.\nWe assume that adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024, and below the tax line, you should factor in $20 million of profit elimination related to minority interests. We're expecting between $1.3 billion and 1.5 billion of net capital expenditures in 2024, and we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $6.5 billion and 7 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share back share buybacks, which, as I mentioned earlier, were already completed in January, and we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 383 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we're assuming that we close the acquisition of Olink by mid year.\nAnd finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year, so there are a few things to consider. First, in terms of organic revenue growth, we expect Q1 to be better sequentially than Q4 2023 by one to two points and then improve each quarter during the year. Implied in that is core organic revenue growth in Q1, similar to Q4 2023. Core organic revenue growth is also expected to improve each quarter during the year, leading to moderate growth in the second half of the year.\nFrom a margin standpoint, we expect Q1 to be just under 21% and increase each quarter throughout the year from that level. And we expect Q1 adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 22% of the full year. So, in conclusion, we navigated the challenging environment in 2023 very successfully. We stepped up for our customers and delivered differentiated financial performance for our shareholders. We continue to manage the company with agility and we're really well positioned for the year ahead. I look forward to updating you on.\nOur progress as we go through the year.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q and.\nA portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, please press star followed by 2. Again, to ask a question, please press star followed by 1. In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher management team, please limit your time on the call to one question and one follow up. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you.\nGood morning, Marc.\nMorning. So if you look at the business, I think the question is if you.\nStart to see some recovery, could you?\nTalk about what parts you think could grow more or less above market and just what that can mean in terms of revenue and earnings?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So just Jack, when I think about.\nLast year, and you've heard us say, delivering differentiated short-term performance, strength in the company for the long term, kind of simultaneously, we had the opportunity to look at, obviously, for the first nine months, of how others have done. And we looked at those companies that preannounced or reported so far, and we had a really strong year in terms of delivering, you know, above-market growth, which means share gain. Right. And that share gain actually was broad-based in terms of the performance you look at, you know, things like analytical instruments, very strong clinical research, pharma services. These businesses did well. And by the absence of some, I'm.\nNot implying anything in the others.\nIt's a very strong year relative to a challenged set of market conditions. As I think to the future, we're well positioned in those businesses to continue our share gain momentum. We made an assumption for this year, which is pretty much the same as what we said back in late October, is that we're assuming that for the full year it's going to be pretty similar to 2023 and a mirror image, meaning that we start to lap comps.\nAs the year unfolds and we wind up with the market being down slightly in the low single digits, and us performing better than that level. So I'm excited about what the year unfolds and our position to deliver differentiated performance, and we're certainly going to capitalize on any improvements in the market and hold ourselves to a very high standard of what good looks like.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nOkay. And are there specific businesses you can talk about? So as an example, in the script, I think you talked about transitioning capacity?\nNew therapies in a potential recovery.\nCan you talk about how you expect?\nPhasing for Patheon and the bioprocessing business?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So when I think about the year.\nWe basically use a range of outcomes for each of our businesses in terms of how they perform. I believe that the second half of the year, based on lapping the columns as well as, we're expecting that the market conditions improve slightly as the year unfolds. And that helps with demand for the industry and for us. [That] is how I would think about the business in aggregate. [That] is the way that we manage the company. So thank you, Jack.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today comes from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director, and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nMorning guys. Thanks for the questions.\nMarc, obviously a lot of discussion on.\nDestocking across the industry.\nCan you just maybe add some color to where you think you are with that process and maybe draw a distinction?\nFor us, between the inventory drawdown that's taking place on the bioprocess.\nSide specifically versus more routine consumables, you.\nknow, if you split it that way.\nAre the drawdowns kind of happening at?\nA similar pace and ending at a similar time, or do you think we should sort of keep those two buckets?\nSeparately or think of them differently?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So Dan, I guess let me start with sort of bioproduction, which I think is the essence of the question and maybe a step one level above that in terms of bioproduction. You know, it is an incredibly good long-term market. Historically it's been, you know, an incredibly good market. Sort of a taboo name these days, right? In terms of bioproduction, caused a lot of volatility during, certainly, 2023 in the industry.\nFor us. A couple of facts, right? It's a little bit under 10% of our revenue, and we have best-in-class bioprocessing products with an incredible global footprint. We have leading positions in cell culture, media, single-use technologies, and increasingly important purification business as we grow our share position there. When I think about the fourth quarter, we did see a sequential pickup in orders in Q4 versus Q3, but the underlying activity is still muted, right, in the market. So we didn't see an inflection, we weren't expecting one, and we didn't see one in the fourth quarter. Our view is that it will normalize as the year unfolds. And as I've said in an investor conference earlier in the year, no one's going to get rewarded for calling the moment of when that inflection happens. So it'll play out during the course of the year.\nThe long-term fundamentals here are very strong. You know, when I think about, you know, our businesses, you know, in general coming into the year, you know, I think the things that are very exciting is.\nThe trusted partner status that we have earned with our customers over many, many years. You know, we're in the room with the decision makers, we understand what's on their mind, we're incredibly well positioned. If I think about, you know, the midterm outlook for clinical research, for pharma services, for bioproduction, for our channel business, it's incredibly well positioned.\nRight.\nIn terms of, we're part of helping our customers bring the breakthroughs through their pipeline. We're part of helping them navigate, you know, whatever the environment is. So hopefully that's helpful. And then maybe the last comment that I would make is one of my takeaways from the many, many customer interactions that I had in the first month of the year was that in the biotech community, and what I mean by biotech is I'll call it the smaller companies, the capital market dependent companies in the pharma biopharmaceutical segment.\nThey were much more positive.\nRight.\nThey're seeing green shoes. They love the M&A activity that was happening at the end of the year that gets investors excited about, you know, new company formation, new rounds of capital. And while it's early and it will take some time, it's certainly the most optimistic that I've seen in the last five quarters in terms of what the tone was on their view, and I think that bodes very well for the coming few years. Thank you.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director, and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nOkay, that's encouraging. Maybe just a follow up on the AI piece. Consistently solid growth there. I'm curious if you're just still carrying.\nA backlog in microscopy and can you.\nMaybe just talk a little bit about.\nLead times and order conversion this year?\nIs the assumption that those might get extended as we move through the year?\nOr do you think maybe you can?\nBe stable relative to where we are today?\nThanks.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So when I think about the performance of our analytical instruments business with double-digit growth for the full year, that was awesome. Really a tremendous year. It was across all three businesses. The backlog that we carried into the beginning of 2023. Those things largely cleared in H1 2023. So we've been at normal lead times, normal shipping times really for about six months now in terms of that already. So we're kind of in a normal spot. And while there won't be the repeat of the, you know, the unwind of the pandemic impacts on the supply chain, the business is positioned for a good year. And you know, there's high demand for the breakthrough technologies, whether it's in electron microscopy for semiconductor material science, life sciences, or the astro.\nRight.\nIn chromatography mass spec. It's just incredible demand for those technologies. We're excited for the upcoming year and the future of that business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question today comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nDerik de Bruin\n\nManaging Director and the Senior Life Sciences & Diagnostics Tools Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning, everyone.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGood morning, Derik.\n\nDerik de Bruin\n\nManaging Director and the Senior Life Sciences & Diagnostics Tools Analyst, Bank of America\n\nSo, Marc, I'm just sort of curious. Last quarter you were talking about 1% core growth when you were sort of looking at your initial framework for 2024. If I heard you correctly, now it's ±1%. It didn't seem like Q4 got a lot worse in anything. So what's changed? Are you more conservative on?\nYou know.\nThe PPD in these businesses are more conservative on just tough comps. I'm just sort of curious what's embedded now in this, like more conservative outlook?\nSteve, why are you?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, so let me provide some context on the guidance, kind of a step back on that and then hopefully help frame your questions. So we provided an early framing for 2024 on our last call and had the insight on how Q4 played out and completed our detailed planning work with our businesses. Through that process, our view on the market outlook has not changed significant. The guidance is not significantly different from the initial framing that we provided. Includes the latest view on fx, both rates and expected mix of revenue and cost by currency. That increased revenue from our initial framing, but no impact on operating income, which reduces our margins by 20 basis points from that initial framing.\nAnd then from an operational standpoint, I think the only item of note that's changed in the past three months is a discrete item in our pharma services business. We're transitioning some of our sterile fill finish capacity from COVID vaccine support to GLP-1 support. We'd have been expecting to recognize an upfront fee in Q1 2024. Now the accounting's finalized, we expect to recognize that benefit in line with production, which actually starts in 2025. So it shifted approximately $0.20 out of Q1 2024, and that's had some impact in terms of the reported core growth. And then one other comment on the guidance is that we thought it best to provide a range, not a point estimate. So I think it's more helpful for our investors and the range of outcomes for the year.\nNow, the range doesn't encapsulate every possible scenario for the year, but it does capture the reasonably likely scenarios of how the year can play out. As we see it today, the range is about $1 billion in revenue and $1.05 of adjusted EPS, which I think is appropriate given the scale of the company. That hopefully kind of teed up kind of the framing for the guide.\n\nDerik de Bruin\n\nManaging Director and the Senior Life Sciences & Diagnostics Tools Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay.\nA little bit more. How should we sort of think about the segment margins as we go through? I mean, I'm just sort of looking. I mean, you've seen really good progress in LSS, and you may see good progress in your margins and expanding margins across all of them. But I'm just sort of thinking about how should we think about LPS, and given where you were in the, is that 14% margin range that we're seeing for the full year, is that sustainable? Does that fall back next year? I'm just trying to figure out where the margin hit is given relative to what our expectations were.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nIn terms of. We finished the year exactly where we guided to for the full year for our margin profile for the company. And I think some of the changes in terms of Q4 versus between the segments, I don't think everyone quite understood the phasing of our revenue within lab products and biopharma services. When I see some of the pre.\nCall notes.\nThis is, I think, a.\nLittle bit different in terms of what some expectations, but from our expectations internally, Q4 played out as we'd expected, and then from margins going forward.\nI think the margin profile that we have today. I'm not calling a significant difference in margin profile going forward into next year. And I think where we are in landing point and margins for the segments is probably a good starting point.\nThink about the year ahead.\n\nDerik de Bruin\n\nManaging Director and the Senior Life Sciences & Diagnostics Tools Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGreat. Thanks, Eric.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director, Senior Research Analyst, and the Head of Life Science & Diagnostic Tools, Wolfe Research\n\nAll right.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGood morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGood morning, Doug.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nWelcome back.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director, Senior Research Analyst, and the Head of Life Science & Diagnostic Tools, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Great to be back and working with great folks like you and the team. So I want to start just with a high-level LRP question, and then my follow-up is really just a clarification on LRPs. So on the LRP, you've been consistent in saying that Thermo is built to grow two to three points better than the peer group over the long term. That said, you did talk about 7% to 9% growth as recently as last year's analyst day. I'm sure the two to three points hasn't changed. But as we flip the calendar, is it fair to say that the 7% to 9% growth rate, you know, maybe is a little bit high even in a more normalized environment?\nI just want to give you an opportunity to maybe just adjust that, you know, as we kind of flip the calendar and look ahead and below the top line. You know, you've done a fantastic job as always leaning operations in a more challenging period. You know, never, never let a good crisis go to waste. Your guidance suggests to me, at least on the surface, that you may be investing more in the near term. But as we think about a return to normal, I'm just wondering if you think we could get some outsized incremental margin flow through for the business as the business normalizes. So let me leave it there and.\nThen I'll ask the quick follow up.\nOn LPS in a second.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSure. Doug, thanks for the question.\nIn terms of the long-range outlook, we raised our outlook in late 2021 and.\nWhat? That at that moment nobody can remember exactly what that moment was, but we were growing 25%.\nRight.\nWe were growing at an extraordinary organic rate. And what we wanted to do was give our investors a very long-term view of what is the market and what is our position in the market. Right. And in terms of our ability to gain share, you know, three points I think is two, three, but I use three for simplicity. Three points faster than the market is kind of the standard we hold ourselves to. And we've been delivering that for a while and we've been growing share for a really long while, for many, many, many years. And so nothing has changed there in terms of the market growth where the market was extraordinary when we said it, we said four to six was going to be our underlying market growth, and that was higher than 3 to 5.\nThe change was actually just that we had a larger exposure to pharma and biotech as we built our business capability there. When I look to the future and I think about what's going on in the directional drivers of the long term in our industry, I feel incredibly confident that this is a 4% to 6% growth industry and that we're well positioned to grow, for simplicity, three points faster than that. So 7% to 9%. So while I get the question a lot and obviously in a period where we delivered 1% core growth in 2023, that's a long way from 7% to 9%. But our view on the market declining low single digits last year reflects at least a share gain component. And when I look to the future, I continue to remain very confident in the long term health of the industry.\nI've had some really interesting discussions with investors and basically went through the logic saying if you're bullish on life science tools, diagnostics, and pharma services, you know, you're probably at 6% long term growth. And if you're bearish on the life science tools, diagnostics, and pharma services, you're probably at 4% industry growth, but you have to be incredibly bearish on the world to actually get to less than 4% industry growth for the long term in our segment. Because we really are a GDP plus type business in terms of the markets that we serve. So hopefully that gives you at least a sense of how we think about it. And while I appreciate the offer to change our outlook, I couldn't be more confident in the future of our industry and our competitive position in terms of the below the line, the very high level concept.\nI do believe that as you see volumes grow at more normalized rate, you'll see a very strong flow through on the margins. And part of what's going on with the margins for this year is we reset our incentive compensation for our colleagues back to normalized levels after a year of below that. So just the math says you have some level of headwind embedded in these year numbers. Nothing different than we expected in October. But that's part of why you don't see as much of the margin step up that one would expect to have.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director, Senior Research Analyst, and the Head of Life Science & Diagnostic Tools, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, I'm going to, I'll leave the LPS question for another day. But I guess the other part of my question on the margins, Marc, was, you know, obviously you got to pay people. You got to reset things in a period where you're not growing as much. This is, you know, where Thermo has historically played offense while others have played defense to a certain extent. So I'm just wondering if you're actually pulling forward some investment early in the year and that could over the next several quarters lead to even better than expected margin flow through as the company returns to a more normalized period.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Doug, I think the example that I gave on the GLP1 contract is we're basically standing up a facility for a customer. We're getting paid a fee to do that. We get to recognize that fee over the production volumes, and we're incurring substantial, substantial cost in the interim in 2024, which will create good accretive growth going forward. That's one good example. And we're continuing to invest in innovation across the company, and we're not lessened our drive here to really drive great long term growth. So we're appropriately managing our costs with a top line environment. We're making sure that we're actually putting the right investments in place to make sure that that top line environment stays.\nThe outlook is as good as we.\nAs much as articulated.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Doug.\nOkay, I'll leave it there. Thanks so much.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director, Senior Research Analyst, and the Head of Life Science & Diagnostic Tools, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar, Everc ISI.\nPlease go ahead.\nYour line is now open.\n\nVijay Kumar (Everc\n\nSenior Managing Director, Head of Medical Supplies and Devices Research, and Senior Equity Research",
    "content2": "Hi Marc, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. My first one, Marc, when I look at the annual guidance here, the core is flattish at the midpoint, but excluding the vaccine headwinds, it's about three points. That's a pretty solid guide. The three things that have come up are China, the CRO business, and analytical tech. Can you just remind us what China.\nWhat PPD did in fiscal 2023 and.\nIs the guide assuming?\nThose three pieces.\nChina, CRO, and analytical tech, is that at 3%? About 3% below 3%. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo Vijay, thanks for the question. So when I think about.\nThe performance of our businesses, certainly last year and certainly as we look to the future.\nLast year, just spectacular performance in our clinical research business, really the team, unbelievably good job in terms of the results, and I think that in a way we probably undersold the details, not the numbers as much as sort of what actually was going on, because there were so many different things we were communicating. But if I think about clinical research, you know, it's a little over two years after the acquisition, phenomenal acquisition, customers love it, business performing well, and colleagues doing a great job. Right. It's been a big success. The business in the pandemic played the largest role in supporting the clinical trials on vaccines and at the same time delivered by far the fastest. I'll call it underlying growth, excluding all of the COVID activity, just crushed it.\nThat means for this year we have both a roll off which we've given transparency to on, you know, a big chunk of the vaccine revenue, which is fine. And we have generated a really substantial comparison which is cool. Like, that's good, good challenge to have in terms of the great performance. So we would expect that the business's growth would be much more moderate this year just based on the comparisons. But the future, meaning looking out into 2025 and beyond, you know, this is a really strong business, long-term high single-digit growth business plus the synergy driving. So I feel really great about that.\nThen a quick comment just on China, which is unrelated to clinical research, but sort of the other element of your question. China, you know, market conditions were challenged in 2023. Q1 was really strong, lots of stimulus, all of those good things. But then, so that was China. Effectively, we're not calling for a meaningful improvement in China this year, rather we lap the comparisons as the year unfolds. So it becomes a little bit less of a headwind. We all know that at some point the Chinese government will create some mechanism of stimulus, whether that's direct, confidence, or whatever it does. We don't know when that will happen. But at some point it will improve the market conditions because the needs for what we do is very high.\nSo I'm bullish on the long term being better in China than what we've been experiencing currently, and it'll take some time to get there.\nGreat, thanks Vijay.\nGo ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar (Everc\n\nSenior Managing Director, Head of Medical Supplies and Devices Research, and Senior Equity Research\n\nStephen, just one quick one for you on Q1. I think operating margin of slightly under 21%. I think the EPS is around $4.70-ish. Is that just the outsized impact from incentive comp reset? Just want to understand the Q1 margin cadence.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So when I think about the margin in Q1, that's definitely an element when you look at it year over year and kind of sequentially as well. So when I think about it year over year.\nSo there's the.\nObviously we have a significant drag from the lower pandemic revenue and the reset of the incentive comp that's just under 200 basis points in total.\nThen about 100 basis points contribution from the core business despite the lower dollars of revenue, and the key driver there being the impact of the cost actions that we've taken over the past year. So it's a good way to frame the margin in Q1, and then yes, the margin profile grows each quarter as.\nTheir revenue dollars grow during the year in terms of the profile for the year ahead.\nThanks Vijay.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you guys.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley.\nPlease go ahead.\nYour line is now open.\n\nTejas Savant\n\nExecutive Director, and Senior Healthcare Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey guys, good morning, and thanks for the time here. Marc, just to follow up on your China commentary, there's more in terms of the long-term opportunity. You've talked in the past about that being an important market for you growing at the higher end of your outlook for the company. You know, recently there's been a thawing in relations over the last month or so. I think you've kind of alluded to that as well, and you know, some high-level government engagement. But then you know, a little while ago we got word of this BIOSECURE Act legislation. Can you just help us think through sort of what that entails for you?\nPerhaps an opportunity to be more front-footed and gain share in the near-term on the services side versus kind of the long-term risk of a potential blowback from the Chinese side in terms of US MNCs operating in that market. That would be super helpful. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSure. So, thanks for the question. In terms of China.\nA market that we've been in for 40 years, a set of capabilities that we built over a long period of time that's helped Chinese society and created American jobs as part of it, better food supply, addressing air pollution, helping produce medicines for the local population. We have a great reputation. I've had the honor of being the chair of the US-China Business Council over the last couple of years and interacting both with the US Administration and the Chinese government. While it's clear to me that the short term GDP environment is challenged in China, that the needs for what our industry does and what Thermo Fisher does for the long term is good, it'll be a solid growth market, certainly one of the faster growing geographies in the long term in terms of the relations.\nBetween the countries. Yeah, I agree with your sentiment. There's a thawing, and in terms of potential legislation, there are thousands of bills that are written that don't happen. So until something sort of matures through the process, you know, it's hard to really know whether it comes to pass and what the exact implications. In my quick read of what they're working on this particular one, it really is basically an opportunity for non-Chinese companies to have a stronger position in serving federal government-related entities. So that's sort of the essence of that. And obviously as a non-Chinese company, we'd be well positioned to support the US government. So thank you for the question. Let me just do a quick wrap on the call. So thanks everyone for participating in our call today. We entered this year with strong momentum.\nWe're in a great position to deliver an excellent year in 2024. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."

My name is Ellen, and I'll be the operator for today's call. During the presentation, all lines will be on mute; however, there will be an opportunity for a question and answer session at the end. To register a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. I'd now like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the investor section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News, Events, and Presentations until 10 November 2023. A copy of the press release of our Q3 2023 earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials.

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q3 Call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter, and then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing play out in the macroeconomy and the implications for our guidance. In Q3, our revenue was $10.57 billion.\nOur adjusted operating income grew 8% to $2.56 billion, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin 200 basis points to 24.2%, and we delivered excellent growth in adjusted EPS, achieving a 12% increase to $5.69 per share. We delivered a very strong Q3. In the quarter, the market environment continued to get more challenging, so I thought that it would be best to update you on what we're seeing and the implications on our guidance for the full year.\nAs a reminder, coming out of Q2, we assumed core market growth to be in the 0% to 2% range for the year, driven by two factors: cautious customer spending and low economic activity in China. As we indicated in September, those same two factors increased in impact, and we now expect core market growth to be slightly negative for the year. Our team did a good job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the quarter, and we continue to expect to grow faster than the market for the full year and to once again deliver share gain in 2023.\nFactoring in the current macroeconomic conditions that I discussed, as well as the related increase in FX headwinds, we're revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for 2023. We now expect revenue to be $42.7 billion and adjusted EPS to be $21.50 per share.\nStephen will outline the underlying assumptions later in the call, along with some thoughts to help frame 2024. So, as I look ahead, the combination of our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System will enable us to successfully navigate dynamic times, positioning us to deliver differentiated short-term performance and simultaneously strengthening our long-term competitive position and outlook.\nThe long-term prospects for our industry remain as bright as ever. Science continues to advance at a rapid pace, and our tools are used by scientists for the most important work that they do, providing the foundation for the scientific breakthroughs they enable. Our capabilities enable the pharma and biotech industry, which is addressing so many unmet healthcare needs. Let me now turn to our Q3 revenue performance in the context of our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, growth declined 1% for the quarter.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue runoff performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a headwind in this customer segment. In Q3, performance in this end market was led by our pharma services business. In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses. In industrial and applied, growth was flat for the Q3.\nPerformance in this end market was led by our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare in Q3, revenue was approximately 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, the team delivered good core business growth highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology, and transplant diagnostics businesses. We made strong progress on our growth strategy in Q3.\nAs a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with innovation, it was another great quarter for the company. We launched a number of high-impact new products across our businesses that are further strengthening our industry leadership and providing our customers with new technologies to enable breakthroughs in their work. Let me start with a brief update on the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific ASTRO, which we launched at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry in June.\nDemand has been very strong, and it's great to see these instruments being so quickly adopted by our customers for their protein discovery research. In the quarter, we launched the EXENT solution in Europe after receiving IVDR certification.\nIt's the latest innovation from our protein diagnostics business, which, as you know, became part of Thermo Fisher with the acquisition of The Binding Site at the beginning of the year. EXENT complements our leading portfolio of assays that help to diagnose and monitor blood protein abnormalities related to multiple myeloma and other disorders. In our bioproduction business, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next-generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies.\nAnd in our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Hydra BioPlasma FIB, providing high-resolution imaging along with a simplified workflow for cell biologists. And earlier this week, Time Magazine selected Thermo Fisher's preeclampsia test as one of Time's 2023 best inventions.\nAs you may recall, this is the first and only immunoassay to aid in the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia, and it received FDA breakthrough designation and clearance earlier in the year. Now, turning to the trusted partner status we've earned with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry-leading products, services, and expertise together in ways that no one else can.\nWe continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. As you know, we've had strong demand for our biologics drug substance manufacturing capabilities. And during the quarter, we completed an expansion of our site in St. Louis, Missouri. This facility supports therapies for a wide range of diseases, including cancer, autoimmune conditions, and rare genetic disorders.\nIt features our new Thermo Scientific HyPerforma DynaDrive 5,000-liter single-use bioreactor, which is a significant advancement in single-use technology. The DynaDrive offers better performance and is scalable to much larger volumes than previous-generation bioreactors. We also further strengthened our clinical research offering by opening a facility in Ohio to produce sample collection kits for clinical trials. This enables us to deliver customized kits to our clients and provide greater supply chain stability to support their trials.\nAs always, our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day, and it enables us to improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance while also helping us to navigate a dynamic environment. I'm proud of our team's efforts, which resulted in strong operating margin expansion in the quarter.\nWe continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. It's been a very active year. As I mentioned earlier, we closed The Binding Site in January, and the business is performing exceedingly well. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory-grade real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies.\nAs a reminder, real-world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high-growth market segment, as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, as well as regulatory bodies, are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in the post-approval setting. The business is now part of our clinical research business, and it's off to a great start.\nShortly after the close of the quarter, we announced the agreement to acquire Olink, a company that is accelerating proteomics. Olink's products enable leading academic researchers and the biopharmaceutical companies to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. Its proprietary technology, Proximity Extension Assay, provides high-throughput protein analysis. The acquisition of Olink underscores the profound impact that proteomics is having as our customers continue to advance life science research and precision medicine.\nThis technology is highly complementary to our leading mass spectrometry and life sciences platforms, and we're uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. We expect to deliver $125 million in adjusted operating income synergies in Year 5, driven by revenue synergies and cost efficiencies. We expect this business to be a mid-teens revenue growth business for us well into the future.\nThe transaction is targeted to be closed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. So, 2023 has been an active year of M&A that further strengthens Thermo Fisher Scientific for the future. During the quarter, we continue to advance our environmental, social, and governance priorities. This included launching a collaboration with the National Minority Quality Forum, a not-for-profit research and education organization that helps bring clinical research to historically underserved patient populations through their alliance for representative clinical trials.\nThe collaboration supports pharma and biotech customers in meeting regulatory expectations to enroll and retain patients in clinical trials who more fully reflect real-world populations experiencing the disease or health condition being studied. It also helps to enable our customers to meet US Food and Drug Administration requirements around diversity action plans.\nIn terms of our environmental sustainability efforts, we've officially surpassed our original goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. As we previously announced, we've increased our target to a 50% reduction by 2030, and we're well on our way to achieving that goal. I'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success, but also by creating a greater work environment for our colleagues and making a positive impact for society. So, to summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we delivered strong operating performance in Q3, driven by our team's execution and the power of our PPI Business System.\nGiven the more challenging macroeconomic environment, we're taking the right actions and appropriately managing the company. And we're incredibly focused on delivering differentiated short-term performance while simultaneously strengthening our long-term competitive position and outlook.\nThe attractive long-term outlook for the life sciences industry remains unchanged, and we're uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities, and make of this period an even stronger industry leader with a very bright future. With that, I'm now handing the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in that press release, and as Mark just outlined, while the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in Q3, we continued to deliver differentiated performance. In Q3, we delivered $10.6 billion of revenue, which included 1% core organic revenue growth. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and we delivered $5.69 of adjusted EPS, a 12% increase over Q3 last year. We're continuing to successfully navigate the current environment.\nLet me now provide you with some additional details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.69 of adjusted EPS in Q3. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.42. On the top line, reported revenue was 1% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange.\nTurning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q3, North America declined mid-single digits. Europe grew in the low single digits. Asia-Pacific declined in the low single digits, with China declining in the high single digits.\nWith respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 24.2%, 200 basis points higher than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization. This is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments, and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI Business System. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 42%, 30 basis points higher than Q3 last year. Moving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 14.8% of revenue, an improvement of 140 basis points over Q3 last year. Total R&D expense was $320 million in Q3, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation.\nR&D is a percent of our manufacturing revenue, with 6.7% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $113 million, which is similar to Q3 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%, which is 180 basis points lower than Q3 last year, reflecting results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q3, approximately 7 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution.\nTurning to cash flow in the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $4.7 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3.7 billion after investing $1 billion of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and we deployed just over $900 million of capital for the acquisition of CorEvitas.\nWe ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in cash and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.7x on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company.\nTo now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue is higher in the prior year. That does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation.\nMoving on to the segment details, starting with life sciences solutions, Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 18%, and organic revenue was 19% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven predominantly by the runoff of our pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income for life sciences solutions decreased 16%, and adjusted operating margin was 35.9%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and had favorable FX, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume mix. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q3, and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 21%, and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, up 290 basis points year over year.\nIn the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume pull-through, which was partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q3, reported revenue increased 2%, and organic revenue was 6% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology, and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year-ago quarter.\nQ3 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 29% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 26.1%, which is 550 basis points higher than Q3 2022. During the quarter, we delivered favorable volume mix and very strong productivity. That was partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. Finally, in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 3%, and organic growth was 1%.\nDuring Q3, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 29%, and adjusted operating margin was 16.4%, which is 340 basis points higher than Q3 2022. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and favorable mix, which was partially offset by FX.\nLet me now turn to guidance. As Mark outlined, we're revising our full year 2023 guidance to reflect the more challenging macroeconomic environment. Our revised estimate for 2023 is revenue of $42.7 billion, with core organic revenue growth of just under 1%, and $21.50 of adjusted EPS. Let me now provide you with some details behind the change in guidance versus the estimate we provided on our last earnings call. Starting with revenue, our revised guidance is $850 million lower than the prior outlook.\n$200 million of this is driven by an increased headwind from FX. We've increased our guide by $45 million to reflect the acquisitions of CorEvitas, and the rest of the change is due to our lower core revenue assumption. We now see core organic growth for the year of just under 1%, which is a little less than 2% lower than the prior guide. This is driven by the same factors that we've seen throughout the year: the weak economic conditions in China, and cautious spending in general across our customer base.\nAs we indicated during Q3, these factors increased in impact during the quarter, and our assumption is that the conditions we saw at the end of Q3 will continue throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, we now expect core market growth for our industry to be slightly negative for the year.\nHowever, we continue to effectively navigate the macro dynamics and expect to continue to deliver differentiated core organic revenue growth for the year despite the more challenging conditions. Moving on to profitability, the revised guidance assumes a pull-through on the lower revenue of just over 40%, and we now expect our adjusted operating margin to be 22.9% for the year. We continue to use the PPI business system to manage our costs appropriately given the market conditions.\nFrom an adjusted EPS standpoint, the revised guidance is $0.17 lower due to FX and $0.69 related to the change in core revenue. So we now expect to deliver $21.50 of adjusted EPS in 2023, a strong result given the challenging macro environment. Let me now provide you with some additional details of the updated 2023 guidance. We continue to assume that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023.\nWe expect the total vaccines and therapies-related revenue will be $1.6 billion less than the prior year, an impact of over 4% on our core organic revenue growth. This assumes we'll recognize $1.3 billion of vaccine therapies revenue in 2023, $600 million of which is in our clinical research business. Moving on to FX, given recent rate changes, we're now assuming that FX will be a year-over-year headwind to revenue of approximately $100 million.\nAnd in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $0.28, which is $0.17 more of a headwind than our previous guidance. The Binding Site and CorEvitas acquisitions are performing well, and we now assume that they'll contribute approximately $300 million to our reported revenue growth for the year.\nBelow the line, we now expect just under $500 million of net interest expense in 2023, a slight increase reflecting the acquisition of CorEvitas. We continue to assume that the adjusted tax rate for 2023 will be 10%, and we're now expecting net capital expenditures will be between $1.3 and 1.5 billion. We now expect that free cash flow will be between $6.7 and 6.9 billion for the year.\nIn terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January, $3.7 billion in acquisitions completed this year, and $3.1 billion committed to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close in 2024. We continue to assume that full year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares, and that we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022.\nSo before I conclude my prepared remarks, I thought it would be helpful to share some more detailed thoughts around how to frame 2024. At this point in time, a good starting assumption is that our core organic revenue growth in 2024 is similar to 2023, approximately 1% growth. With our proven growth strategy, we expect to continue to take share, and that would mean market growth in 2024 will be similar to 2023, with the market declining one to two points.\nIn terms of phasing of our core organic revenue growth, it's best to assume a more challenging first half and then moderate growth in the second half. The pandemic-related revenues, both testing and total vaccines and therapies, are likely to be around $300 million in 2024. This is a headwind of approximately $1.3 billion, or 3% of revenue.\nM&A is expected to increase revenue $175 million year-over-year after a combination of six months of Olink and the inorganic portion of CorEvitas revenue in 2024. And based on current rates, we'd expect FX to be a headwind to revenue in 2024 of approximately $375 million, just under 1%. So wrapping all this together, 2024 revenue dollars will be very similar to 2023.\nIn terms of adjusted operating income dollars, with this top-line setup, we would expect to deliver similar adjusted operating income dollars to 2023. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to manage costs very carefully, but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to continue to strengthen our industry leadership.\nStrong underlying productivity and cost controls are expected to offset the runoff in the remaining pandemic revenue, inflation, and the normalization of incentive compensation across the company and appropriate investment in our colleagues. Below the line, the interest income benefit from our cash generation and an assumption of $3 billion of buybacks in 2024 would more than offset the impact of a slight increase in our tax rate to 10.5%. All of this would enable us to deliver around $21.75 of adjusted EPS for the year.\nSo the high-level summary is that with these assumptions, we'd expect 2024 core organic revenue growth to be similar to 2023, and that our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System would enable us to continue to manage the macro conditions and the runoff in pandemic revenue very effectively so we can deliver revenue and profitability similar to 2023 and a slight increase in adjusted EPS.\nNow, should the market conditions be better than I just outlined, our growth strategy, improvement, and execution capabilities will enable us to deliver the upside benefit. I look forward to providing you our formal guidance for 2024 on our next earnings call, along with our usual supporting details for the year ahead. At that point, we'll have the insight from a full year of 2023, and we'll have a better view on the macro conditions entering 2024.\nSo in conclusion, we'll continue to navigate the environment really well, delivering differentiated financials and further strengthening our industry leadership. We remain really well positioned to capitalize on additional opportunities as market growth normalizes over time. And as we think about our cost base, we're really well positioned to drive strongly accretive growth going forward. Now, let me turn the call back over to Raf. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now enter our Q&A session. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher Management Team, please limit your time on the call to one question and only one follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please return to the queue. When preparing to ask your question, please ensure that your device is unmuted locally. Our first question today comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGood morning, and thank you for all the color. Marc, bigger picture question. Upon greater reflection, how much of your decision to raise the long-term target, the 7% to 9%, do you think may have been based on the environment we were in? And was curious, do you think it's prudent for investors to think of something lower than that in the medium term?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Jack, thanks for the question. When I think about the long-term guidance, or long-term targets, right, what's underlying it is 4% to 6% growth, right? I don't think there's any controversy, market growth, 4% to 6% market growth. I don't think there's any controversy that we're going to grow meaningfully faster, because if you look at the last 10 or 15 years, we've delivered superior organic growth, and it keeps getting better and better relative to the market, right? So the spread of two to three points better than that, that's not in question, right? So at 4% to 6%, you get to the 7% to 9%.\nWhen I think about my 20-plus years in this industry, thinking about what the historical growth is, what the drivers are for the growth, I feel 4% to 6% long-term market growth is actually the appropriate number, that the things that the industry are going through now do not change my view that the long-term health of this industry is exceptionally bright and that you'll see that return. I can't call when exactly that returns, but what I can say is that the unmet healthcare needs and all the drivers that we talked about on our analyst day remain extraordinarily bright for the future. So thank you, Jack.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThanks. Then maybe as a follow-up, the deterioration kind of in the market we've seen since Q2 earnings or even early September, what are you hearing from customers as you try and diagnose what's happening here? Just what are your thoughts on kind of the recent increase in the 10-year? How does that impact kind of the pace of the recovery as you see it?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. I've been out with customers, as you know. I do that a lot. I've been out on a definite customer tour out there, both in Europe and the US, and earlier in the quarter, I was in China. So when I think about what our customers are saying, they're actually very bullish on the mid- to long-term, right? So there's incredible opportunities for us. What I would say is short-term, if you're visiting a smaller biotech customer, what you're seeing is concerns about when the funding environment's going to improve.\nSo there's a level of caution. And I think that's generally across the customer base. Customers are being cautious after a very robust pandemic period, right? But long-term, and the excitement, and customers looking forward to the future with us is extremely positive.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nAnything on the long-term interest rate?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nNo, I wouldn't think about the long-term interest rate. I think from a funding standpoint, I think there's a spread between interest rates and then what kind of return people are going to get on investment. And as the valuation expectations moderate for our customers, I think the funding will start flowing better going forward. The timing of that will still be played out, but the return profile and the successful investment in biotech is still incredibly compelling. So long-term, that will moderate appropriately.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThanks, Steph.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Jack. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. Thanks for the questions, guys. Maybe Marc and Stephen, excuse me. It's somewhat hard to reconcile just the magnitude of this end market weakness, just given the view towards the structural attractiveness of kind of the customer drivers.\nSo maybe could you just give us a lens on this outlook for 2024? Maybe first from a geographic perspective, China, how much of is that a driver towards other regions? And then B, it'd be great for us to learn about within biopharma, your largest customer base, maybe some of the underlying factors that kind of point to this very weak growth in bioprocess, pharma R&D, Marc you just mentioned, pre-commercial biotech. Just give us a little more color on what's driving the real kind of contracted growth outlook.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So Dan, thanks for the question. I think the way that Stephen and I thought about giving an early view to 2024 is not based on us having finished our operating plan process, which we do in December. And then when we actually lay out guidance, we do it based on how did the year finish, all of the details by business, by geography, and then we figure out the details. We took the benefit of each of us having 20-plus years of experience in the industry, looking at the market conditions that we see today, and basically went through the assumptions of how could 2024 play out based on what we know today, right?\nSo this is not a bottoms-up view by country, by geography, and by business unit, but rather based on experience and based on what we're seeing. So when I think about for us next year, right, we try to give you incredible clarity about what's COVID in our numbers, right? So we're expecting a runoff of $1.3 billion of COVID-related revenue in 2024. That would leave $300 million of revenue in 2024, of which we have a pretty good line of sight to what those activities are, right? So that's the first assumption.\nThen the second assumption is effectively what's going on in the base business, meaning excluding the COVID-related business. And that should be a little bit over 3% growth, right? So if you think of those two factors, that's how you get to a core number of 1%. Remember that testing is part of the decline. So that's the set of assumptions. So then there's another lens to think about it, which is comparisons, right? Or we're going to lap the customer caution, different businesses at different points in time. But the first half, we'll have more difficult comparisons having fully seen the effect of caution.\nThe second half, you actually get to more back to kind of moderate growth in that period of time just based on that factor. Then we looked at some of our businesses, like our instrument business, which had the benefit this year of the disruptions from supply chain in 2021 and 2022. We were able to catch up on orders that needed to be shipped. That gave us a little bit of a benefit of growth this year, of which that obviously doesn't repeat next year. We factored all of that in, and we said core is pretty similar to what it is next year.\nWe look forward to actually doing the detailed guidance at the end of January, early February, when we have our earnings call. We'll have all of our puts and takes and be a lot smarter. But we wanted our analyst community to be aligned with what we're seeing today because there's quite a big disconnect in the numbers that are out there for 2024 relative to the numbers that we articulated today.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks, Marc. Maybe just a follow-up on biopharma since it is your biggest customer base and such a key driver. Could you just give us a little bit of a window, just maybe what you're seeing in Q3, kind of how you're thinking about Q4 as maybe a jumping-off point for 2024, large pharma R&D spending, bioprocess, PPD? Can you give us some flavor on your key customer segments and kind of what the trends look like right now? And that'll give us some vantage point for how we think about 2024 there as well. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nDan, I think your fellow analysts are throwing tomatoes at your building today. You're asking 19 questions in that one. But I'll start at a high level and leave some of this for others. Let me break the pharma into what revenue was in Q3 and then a little bit of some of the underlying dynamics. Actually, the revenue in the quarter was incredibly similar to the prior quarter, right, in terms of how we actually performed.\nWe declined 1%. And looking at that, the long-term outlook here is strong. We talked about that in an earlier question. Effectively, customer caution increased a bit. You see that more pronounced in biotech than pharma, but you see it across the customer set. That's more of a forward-looking look. I think the thing that probably is most relevant and why we think about our Q4 the way we do. One of the things that we assumed in our previous guidance was that in our bioprocessing business, that orders would stabilize, start to normalize in the Q3.\nWe did not see that, right? So if you say, \"What's the single biggest driver of the same factors in Q4 versus what we talked about?\" Really, it's bioproduction. We didn't see that normalization of orders. In general, that business operates on a roughly 13-week lead time. So if you don't see the orders in Q3, you're not going to see the revenue step up in Q4. So hopefully, that's helpful in terms of the framing. I'm sure I'll get some of the other ones in future questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Dan. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDerik De Bruin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, thank you. And good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Mark, you typically haven't called out the COVID impact to PPD, the biopharma services business in the past. Can you just sort of clarify what that was in 2022 and 2023 overall so we can do the number? And also staying on that segment, Pfizer and Moderna are big customers of yours. They both sort of announced some R&D cuts. How should we sort of think about how that flows through the business? And I guess, is there any sort of from vaccine revenues that are in that business, any sort of take or pays that have sort of been in there? So I know it's a lot on that, but I'll let you start there.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So Derik, great question. So let's talk about clinical research one level above, and then I'll give you some of the answers to the question you have, right? So we are almost at the two-year anniversary of the acquisition of PPD, which closed in early December of 2021. Business is doing great, right? And it's been a terrific acquisition. It is a terrific acquisition with a bright future.\nIf you think about what the moment in time was in December of 2021, PPD had done a great job of growing its core sort of normal business and played a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for vaccines and therapies. Just phenomenally relevant set of capabilities, which is part of the reason we knew how great the business was and how respected it was in the industry.\nSince our ownership, we modeled in that this would be a declining portion of the business. It's actually been a headwind through all of our ownership on core organic growth, right? So if I think about our core organic would have actually been higher than if we didn't include it. But our view was this business's end market growth was really good, and we're just going to grow through it. And it was factored into our guidance. Obviously, as customer caution has increased in pharmaceutical and biotech, the rates of growth in our non-COVID business slows.\nAnd we wanted to ensure that our investors understood that that was actually quite healthy, but we're going through the runoff on vaccines and therapies. To give you the magnitude of the number, what is embedded in our 2023 is a $600 million decline in revenue for vaccines and therapies.\nIt also happens to be $600 million of activity in the year. That's this year. As opposed to sort of take or pay or those things, clinical trials are different. You have patients enrolled. You go through it. That revenue will run off in an orderly fashion over the next couple of years. In the outlook that we gave of $300 million of total revenue for all pandemic-related, some of that, most of it is actually that work in clinical research. There's a little bit of take or pay in pharma services, and nominal amount of testing. Hopefully, that gives you a good sense of the dynamic there.\n\nDerik De Bruin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nRight. If you just think about underlying growth of the core PPD business, just sort of what's your embedded number for this year and sort of the working assumption for next year? Just as I said, there's just a lot of variables. I think just some clarity would help.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So obviously, we'll get into some of that. We don't even do it by business unit in our guidance. But I can give you sort of direction how to think about it. What we had said at the time of the acquisition and what we've said consistently is the long-term growth expectation for this business is high single digits plus the benefit of synergies. And that hasn't changed in terms of the long term.\nOur assumption has been that it would step down from the 20% and then sort of double-digit growth to that. And it actually will step down below that and bounce back up just on the math of the COVID activity runoff over the next year or so. So hopefully, that helps in terms of how to think about modeling it.\n\nDerik De Bruin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Derik.\n\nDerik De Bruin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nDan, just one more if I can. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from J.P. Morgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So appreciate all the color that you've given us today on 2024, but for two areas that I wanted to follow up on. First, how do you see China playing out next year? At this point, is growth in the region going to be reasonable in 2024? Are we going to be looking at declines? And then you've noted that 2024 is also going to be more of a back-half-weighted story, really given those market dynamics.\nSo could you walk us through the magnitude of the step-up that you're expecting between the first half and second half? And how much of that is really going to be driven by easier comps in the back half versus an expected rebound in the market?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo, Rachel, thanks. Let me start with China. I think it's really relevant for the community to understand our view on what's going on in China, right? So first of all, it was great to return to China, which I did in August. And I actually came away with, in a way, more encouraged on the long term. So let me give you a little bit more detail on it. I went to China with two different hats. One is the chair of the US-China Business Council, where I had the opportunity to interact with senior members of the Chinese government, including the premier.\nAnd then I also did my normal thing of being CEO of Thermo Fisher Scientific and had the opportunity to see our colleagues, visit sites, and see a lot of customers during that process. So this is what I came away with from my visit. The economy is definitely challenged, and the conditions are worsening. We saw that worsening during the quarter. The government is actively working to boost business confidence and create a stronger environment for foreign investment.\nSo when I think about kind of the macro picture, short-term, definitely challenge from a macro economy. I was pleasantly surprised that a real focus on a better environment for foreign companies, which bodes well for the future. When I think about the outlook here, we definitely saw the impact of the declining economy in the results. We would expect that that will continue.\nWe can't predict exactly when the market will do. But we know that the comparisons get easier in the second half for China as we lap some of the comparables or the more challenging comparables. When I think about phasing for the year and all of that stuff, we'll look forward to doing that in the beginning of 2024.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. But Rachel, that kind of setup that I put in the prepared remarks is kind of a mirror image of this year as a starting point. Kind of more challenging in the first half and then modest growth in the second half. Thanks, Rachel.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Then if I could squeeze in one more just on instrumentation, that was a bright spot this quarter at 8% growth. You've noted that you're over-indexed to instrumentation in China. And you've also highlighted some of the incremental weakness there. So can you just walk us through what exactly you're seeing in that portfolio? What was instrument growth in China versus the rest of the world? And then how should we think about that setup for instrumentation next year, given you're going to face some of these difficult comps in the first three quarters?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo I'll probably keep it at a pretty high level. Awesome quarter in analytical instruments, 8% growth. Teams doing a good job. Our electron microscopy business really performing extremely well. And great to see the uptake on ASTRO, which is our breakthrough mass spectrometer, which we launched in June. So those are the highlights. Our guidance for this year and our framing for next year reflects the customer caution and the non-repeat of some of the working through the disruptions of the pandemic on supply chain. So that's embedded in the outlook for the year.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. And then, Rachel, just on kind of the additional kind of weakness we saw in China in Q3, some of that came through in revenue in Q3, but it's going to be more in terms of revenue in Q4 because of the lag in terms of bookings profile for an instrumentation business. So that's part of that dynamic as to why Q4 is more impacted by the change profile that we saw in China.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Rachel.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, please limit your time on the call to one question and one follow-up question. Our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Puneet, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Managing Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Leerink Partners\n\nYeah. Thanks, Marc, Stephen. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll wrap two of my questions into one.First, largely on M&A, given the environment right now, the type of deals that you're doing, the type of valuations you're doing at, could you maybe just give us a sense of what you're seeing out there?\nObviously, Olink, prior to that, The Binding Site and CorEvitas. Is that the type of sort of mid-size deals that we should continue to expect here and the opportunity base that you are seeing in M&A? And within the proteomics franchise, now with a successful Orbitrap franchise of the last 15-plus years, combining that with Olink, Marc, maybe at a high level, could you provide us your, for lack of better word, vision on proteomics despite being sort of a tough market this year and next year?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific",
    "content2": "Yeah. So, Puneet, thanks for the question. So when I think about the M&A for this year or M&A even in general, right, the criteria that we use, right, is M&A that's going to be highly valued by our customers, strengthen our strategic position, generate strong returns for our shareholders, right? You look at what the different opportunities are and you think about in different periods of time where it's going to skew in your favor.\nThis year, with a more volatile macro, we've been able to add three phenomenal businesses, right, in terms of strengthening the company with incredible growth prospects, really good return profiles, right? So that doesn't mean that next year's will look exactly like this or years where you can buy companies that are really more of a balance of cost and revenue growth and those different things and different aspects of it.\nBut this year, to be able to get The Binding Site, CorEvitas, and Olink, it's fantastic. And when I think about Olink, which this is our first opportunity, given that we had announced it during a blackout period, it's just a terrific fit, right? And you think about it's a leader in a business that has gone through that phase of being well adopted, right? So the technology risk isn't here anymore, but it hasn't globally commercialized. It hasn't reached nearly its full potential and incredibly complementary to our leading position in mass spectrometry in Proteomics.\nAnd Puneet, thanks for reminding others about our 15-year-plus track record with Orbitrap, ASTRO being the next big many-year run and the combination there plus Olink and the fact that we have a leading position in the life sciences instrumentation, which are very relevant in terms of qPCR for these products as well, really exciting.\nThey are a leader in their field, and we're excited to help bring that to the customer base in an accelerated fashion. And when we look to the future, we expect this to be a long-term mid-teens-plus growth business and be able to generate really significant adjusted operating income synergies driven by that accelerated revenue growth, right? And on top of that, there's $125 million of earnings that come from the year-five synergies, and that's going to generate double-digit returns for the shareholders. So super exciting time. And we'll continue to be outstanding stewards of our shareholders' capital.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Managing Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Leerink Partners\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Eve Burstein from Bernstein. Eve, your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nEve Burstein\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi there. Good morning, and thanks a lot for the question. I'd love to ask about your lab products and biopharma services to this unit. The operating margin there was a bright spot at 16%. It was higher than any point in the past. When you talk about the puts and takes there, you called out productivity and mix as some of the positive drivers. Just two questions there.\nOne, on mix, if that was a positive driver, does that actually mean that sales of some of your really low-margin consumables were down? Other peer companies have talked about challenges there and brought down guidance in general lab products. Can you talk a little bit about those dynamics? Secondly, on productivity gains, what is driving that? Are those going to be sustainable and recurring over time?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks for the question. So when I think about the margin dynamic in that segment, yeah, mix, when you think about where the more challenging environment is in terms of customer caution and China, that impacts the lab products business. And then the wider customer caution also impacts our channel business. So relative to the other business in that segment, that's where the mixed profile comes from.\nIn terms of productivity, it's about we've been right-sizing the cost base within our lab products business and given the volume change. So that's where the majority of that is. And then just good spending wisely across the whole business, but those are probably the two main factors to call out. Thanks, Eve.\n\nEve Burstein\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Eve. [croesstalk]\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nAnd Operator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nPerfect. We'll take our last question today from Dan Leonard from UBS. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you for the time, and really appreciate you sharing all those framing thoughts for 2024. I have a couple of additional follow-ups on that, but I'll keep it to one. I know it's not a bottoms-up view, but I'm curious how you're thinking about the inventory effect, either for your business or the market in 2024. In those areas where there's been inventory burned down in 2023, whether it be in bioproduction or the channels business or wherever you're seeing it, what do you think is a reasonable assumption for 2024? Is it reasonable to assume the burn down concludes and demand can match customer usage? Just any high-level thoughts. Thank you.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nIt's a good question. When I think about it, it's primarily a bioproduction story, and I don't think anyone is smart enough to know exactly which quarter, but during 2024, do I think that we will get back to orders matching revenue at some point during the year? Yes. So I think that we'll be smarter with the benefit of another three months of time to see what our view is on 2024. But I don't think we'll be talking throughout the year about inventory reduction and the customer set because there's activity that's just going on currently that's consuming the inventory that's out there.\nGreat. So let me bring to just a quick wrap-up for the call. Thank you for joining us today. We're very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you in the new year.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference for everybody. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect your line. Have a great rest of your day."

My name is Ellen, and I'll be coordinating the call for today. During the presentation, if you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad to join the question queue. I would like to introduce our moderator of the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may now begin the call.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the investor section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News, Events, and Presentations until 11 August 2023. A copy of the press release of our Q2 2023 earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nActual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC and available in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our Q2 2023 earnings and also in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q2 call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter. Then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing playing out in the macroeconomy and the implications for our outlook. In the Q2, our revenue was $10.69 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion, and we delivered adjusted EPS of $5.15 per share. As you saw in our press release, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the quarter. Economic activity in China slowed, and across the economy more broadly, businesses became more cautious in their spend. This impacted our Q2 results and informed a more moderated view for the full year. We're taking appropriate actions to successfully navigate these conditions.\nAs a reminder, when we set out our guidance at the beginning of the year, we assumed core market growth would be in the normal range of 4% to 6% for 2023. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment at this point, we think it is best to assume that these conditions will persist for the remainder of the year, and our current assumption is that core market growth will be in the 0% to 2% range this year. We're increasing our commercial intensity to help our customers through this environment and capture even more opportunities. We're also leveraging the PPI Business System to appropriately manage our costs. Given these changes, we're revising our revenue and Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. I'll cover some of the key points around the guidance, and Stephen will outline our underlying assumptions later in the call.\nFor 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $43.4 to 44.0 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $22.28 to 22.72. As you know, during periods of change, we have a very clear set of guiding principles on how we manage the company. These principles have three elements. First, everything we do starts with our customers and ensuring that we're enabling their success. Second, we inspire our colleagues to bring their best every day to fulfill our mission. And third, we hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard to deliver differentiated short-term performance, all while capitalizing on dynamic times to enhance our long-term competitive position, creating an even brighter future for our company. To enable the differentiated short and long-term performance in this environment, we're leveraging our PPI Business System to deliver $450 million of additional cost actions in 2023.\nThat's in addition to what was embedded in our previous guidance. We're ramping up our commercial intensity to drive our share gain momentum, and we continue to invest in our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We're uniquely positioned to help them navigate their own challenges in this environment. When I think about our proven ability to navigate market dynamics, combined with the long-term market growth drivers for the life sciences industry, I'm incredibly confident for the future. As I look ahead, there is a clear need for new medicines, and the scientific advances in life sciences are leading to exciting and innovative therapies, which will make a profound positive impact on well-being and be one of the drivers creating the very strong and durable tailwind in our industry.\nLet me now turn to our quarterly performance and provide you with an update on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, growth was flat for the Q2. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue runoff performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a five-point headwind within this market. From a segment perspective, that revenue runoff is essentially all in our life science solutions segment, largely in our biosciences business related to nucleotides and enzymes, and to a lesser extent in bioproduction. The strongest growth in pharma and biotech end market this quarter was in our pharma services and clinical research businesses. In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as our research and safety market channel.\nIn industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for the quarter. The strongest growth in this end market was in our analytical instruments businesses. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue in Q2 was approximately 20% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter, driven by our microbiology, immunodiagnostics, and transplant diagnostic businesses. Let me now turn to our growth strategy. We really made terrific progress in Q2 in this regard. Our growth strategy consists of three pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, innovation, we had a really spectacular quarter. We launched high-impact new products that are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work.\nWe had a great showing at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, where we featured the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, which is the most significant advancement in mass spectrometry in 15 years. The Orbitrap Astral combines speed, high sensitivity, and deep proteome coverage to enable researchers to uncover proteins that previously evaded detection. This will enable breakthroughs that could lead to the development of new targeted therapies for a range of diseases, from cardiovascular disease to cancer. We've already started to deliver the Astral to our customers, and we're very pleased with the strong bookings performance to date. In our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 scanning transmission electron microscope, the latest innovation in our leading line of instruments designed for the semiconductor industry.\nThis fully automated system enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high-quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to accelerate development. In our biosciences business, we introduced the Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Media Kit. It accelerates the development of novel cancer therapies. These kits support the culture of tumor cells derived from individual patients, providing a better disease model for research and drug development that could potentially improve clinical trial success and help bring drug candidates to market faster and more cost-effectively. In specialty diagnostics, we launched the first and only immunoassay to help doctors stratify a mother's risk of developing preeclampsia, a serious complication that can develop in pregnancy and the postpartum period, endangering both mother and baby. We received breakthrough designation and FDA clearance for assessing a patient's risk of developing severe preeclampsia, enabling doctors to better manage care.\nThese are just a few examples of the exciting innovation going on across our company, which will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth. The second pillar of our growth strategy is the trusted partner status that we have built with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry-leading products, services, and expertise together in ways that no one else can. We continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. For example, in our pharma services business, we added an early development hub at our site in Bourgoin, France, enabling early development in addition to commercial manufacturing. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unparalleled commercial engine.\nWe have a meaningful commercial advantage due to the deep engagement that we're able to have with our customers across the globe. A great example of our progress here is further strengthening our commercial capabilities with the opening of a state-of-the-art customer center of excellence in Milan. It features a customer application development lab to showcase our industry-leading products, services, and expertise. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we completed a small bolt-on acquisition of MarqMetrix, a developer of Raman-based spectroscopy solutions for inline process analytics. This technology expands our capabilities to help our customers make precise and accurate measurements throughout their manufacturing processes in a wide range of applications, including biopharma. This business is a nice complement to our analytical instruments business.\nLet me give you a quick update on The Binding Site acquisition, which we closed at the beginning of the year. Our protein diagnostics business has delivered outstanding growth, and the integration is going incredibly well. Our team is progressing the innovation pipeline to advance the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and immune disorders. Just after the close of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory-grade real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. Real-world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high-growth market segment as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, as well as regulatory bodies, are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in a post-approval setting.\nCorEvitas will further strengthen our capabilities to serve our pharma and biotech customers. It's an excellent strategic fit for our company and highly complementary to our clinical research business. There is strong market demand for real-world evidence, which improves decision-making and reduces the time and cost associated with drug development. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and I'm very excited about what this will mean for our customers and the patients they serve. Financially, we expect the business to deliver low double-digit growth and be accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.03 in 2024. So overall, strong progress in Q2 for capital deployment.\nDuring the quarter, we advanced our environmental, social, and governance priorities, including launching a partnership with Pfizer to increase local access to next-generation sequencing-based testing for lung and breast cancer patients in more than 30 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. These are areas where advanced genomic testing has previously been limited or unavailable. Access to local NGS testing can help to provide faster analysis of associated genes, empowering healthcare providers to select the right therapy for that individual patient. Through the partnership, we will work with local labs using our NGS technology to ensure they meet industry standards for NGS testing for breast and lung cancer. Pfizer will work to enable affordable patient access and to raise healthcare provider awareness regarding the benefits of advanced NGS testing. Together, we'll continue to evaluate additional geographic opportunities and to expand testing for other types of cancer.\nI'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success, but also by creating a great work environment for our colleagues and making a positive impact for society. So to summarize our key takeaways from the Q2, while the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging, our team continues to leverage our PPI Business System to deliver strong productivity. We're focused on driving market share gains, and at the same time, we're advancing our proven growth strategy to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. The attractive long-term outlook for the life sciences industry and Thermo Fisher is unchanged. We're incredibly well-positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities, and exit this period an even stronger industry leader with a very bright future.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen.\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release and as Marc just outlined, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in Q2. We're leveraging our PPI Business System to effectively manage these conditions. In the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included just over 2% core organic revenue growth, and we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS. Revenue in the quarter was $300 million lower than we'd incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance. $280 million of this was related to the core business and $20 million related to testing. Approximately 1/3 of the change in core revenue was driven by lower economic activity in China, and the remainder was driven by more cautious spending across our customer base globally, particularly in biotech.\nAdjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.28 lower than we incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance. $0.07 of this was driven by FX and $0.21 by the lower revenue. Given the lower core revenue both in the quarter and assumed in our full-year outlook, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. In Q2, this enabled us to offset $75 million of the profit impact of the lower-than-expected revenue. This highlights that we're actively managing the business. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS in Q2. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.51. On the top line, reported revenue was 3 percentage points lower year-over-year.\nThe components of our Q2 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a slight headwind from foreign exchange. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was just over 2 percentage points. For context, core organic revenue growth includes the runoff in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue. Without that runoff impact, growth would have been 5% in the quarter. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America declined mid-single digits. Europe grew in the low single digits, and Asia-Pacific declined in the mid-single digits, with China declining in the low teens.\nWith respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 9%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, 150 basis points lower than Q2 last year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and achieved strong price realization. This is more than offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments, and FX. Given the change in the macro environment, we're using the PPI Business System to drive significantly more productivity this year than initially planned. We've initiated $450 million of additional cost actions, and as I mentioned earlier, we already began to see this benefit in Q2. Total company-adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41%, 220 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q2 last year. Total R&D expense was $345 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D is a percent of our total revenue, with 7.1% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $148 million, which is $36 million higher than Q2 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. This was 300 basis points lower than Q2 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q2, approximately six million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution.\nTurning to cash flow on the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.5 billion after investing $730 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes and returned $135 million of capital through dividends. Shortly after the quarter end, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire CorEvitas for approximately $900 million. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and $34 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x gross debt to Adjusted EBITDA and 2.9x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.9%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now, provide some color on the performance of our four business segments.\nLet me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year. That does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q2 reported revenue in the segment declined 25%. Organic revenue was also 25% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven by the moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year-ago quarter, and to a lesser extent, the macro factors that I described earlier. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 38%, and adjusted operating margin was 33.2%, down 710 basis points versus the prior year quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2, and organic growth was 10%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 26%, and adjusted operating margin was 24.7%, up 330 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume and mix, and that was partially offset by strategic investments and FX. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q2, revenue increased 1%, and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our microbiology, immunodiagnostics, and transplant diagnostics businesses. This is offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year-ago quarter.\nQ2 adjusted operating income increased 22% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which is 460 basis points higher than Q2 2022. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and favorable business mix, which is partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. And finally, in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 5%, and organic growth was also 5%. During Q2, organic revenue growth in the segment was led by the pharma services and clinical research businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 19%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, which is 160 basis points higher than Q2 2022. We delivered very strong productivity in the quarter, partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Let me now turn to guidance.\nAs Marc outlined, we're revising our full-year 2023 guidance to reflect both the more challenging macroeconomic environment and the offsetting actions that we're taking to navigate these conditions. Revenue for 2023 is now expected to be in the range of $43.4 to 44 billion, with core organic revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $22.28 and $22.72. For modeling purposes, our current estimate of where we're likely to end up for the year within that range is $43.5 billion of revenue, rounding up to 3% core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $22.36. Let me provide you with some additional details behind the change in guidance, starting with revenue. Our revised guidance reflects a change in the assumption for core organic revenue growth from 7% to a range of 2% to 4%.\nIt also assumes $100 million lower testing revenue. Our core organic revenue change is driven by two factors: a reduction in the assumed level of economic activity in China and an assumption that the more cautious spending that we saw across our customer base in Q2 will continue throughout the remainder of the year. In relation to China, at the beginning of the year, we saw positive momentum in the Chinese economy. We had previously assumed that this momentum would continue through the rest of the year. However, as the Q2 progressed, economic activity in China significantly slowed, resulting in less customer activity in the quarter. We think it's appropriate to assume that this condition remains in place for the remainder of the year. With regards to customer spending patterns more broadly, in Q2, customers in our end markets began the year with somewhat cautious spending.\nThis was something that was not confined to our end markets. Companies across most business segments were cautious with their spending given the uncertain macro conditions. This dynamic became more challenging in Q2. We'd previously assumed that this would lessen in impact as the year progressed, and we now think it's appropriate to assume that the cautious spending will continue through the remainder of the year. With strong commercial execution from our team, we expect to successfully navigate these macro dynamics and deliver 2% to 4% core organic revenue growth for the year. And for context, as Marc mentioned, with the changes in the macro, we're now assuming core market growth for our industry to be in the range of 0% to 2% for 2023. It's a reduction of approximately 4 percentage points versus the 4% to 6% assumed previously for market growth.\nWhen I think about the range of outcomes for the full year core organic revenue growth, the largest swing factor is the extent of the budget flush at the end of the year. Should that be weaker than normal, then core organic revenue growth would round down to 2%, and if stronger, it could round up to 4% for the year. If China gets traction stimulating the economy, then that could also be an upside late in the year. So moving now on to profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. We've put in place $450 million of additional cost actions to limit the impact of the expe cted lower revenue on the P&L. This demonstrates our active management of the business.\nAs a result, the high profitability pull-through on the lower revenue is expected to be reduced to 35% in terms of how it flows through to the bottom line. Factoring in this and the updated view of FX, we now expect our adjusted operating income margin to be in the range of 23.2% to 23.4% for the year. So let me amplify some more additional details on the updated 2023 guidance. We're assuming that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023. This is $100 million lower than our prior guidance, and through the half-year point, we've delivered $225 million of testing revenue. Within the core, we continue to expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3 percentage point impact on core organic revenue growth.\nThrough the half-year point, we've delivered $365 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. Moving on to FX, we continue to assume that FX will be a year-over-year tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million. Then in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a headwind of $0.11, which is $0.05 higher than our previous guidance. The Binding Site acquisition is performing well, and we now assume it will contribute approximately $260 million to our reported revenue growth for the year and $0.09 to adjusted EPS. Below the line, we continue to expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. The adjusted tax rate assumption for the year has improved to 10% versus our prior guidance of 10.8%, driven by our tax planning initiatives.\nWe're now expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect the free cash flow will be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We continue to assume that full-year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares and that we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. As is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. We've not included any operational benefit in 2023 for the acquisition of Corevitas. When we get more clarity on the actual close date for that acquisition, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2023. To conclude, we recognize that the change in guidance is significant.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nWe think it's appropriate given the change in the macro environment. As we said at our investor day, should market growth be lower than normal, we will leverage the PPI business system and step up productivity, and that's what we've done. We're well positioned to navigate the near-term environment. While the near-term environment may be more challenging, the long-term fundamentals supporting the growth of our end markets remains unchanged, as does the strength of our position to serve them. Now, let me turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now end the Q&A session. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad.\nIn order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher Management Team, please limit your time on the question to one question and one follow-up question. If you have any additional questions, please return to the queue. When preparing to ask your question, please ensure that you are unmuted locally. Our first question comes from Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Matt, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question.\nMaybe just starting on the guidance, just given the significant change relative to what you talked about at the investor day a few months ago, could you maybe help us a little bit with where some of the biggest deltas in terms of your expectations relative to that time of the investor day and today in terms of either end market or revenue segment, and specifically within China, where there are certain categories or revenue segments or end markets where the weakness is more pronounced? I just kind of wanted to get a little more color on the delta and expectations from the investor day to today.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Matt, thanks for the question. In terms of the guidance change, the way that I think about it, let's start from the beginning of the year.\nI think it's the easiest place to start, and we can talk about the investor day, right? So in terms of the market growth and the conditions there, right, what we're seeing is that China really slowed quite meaningfully in Q2, right? And that's actually somewhat surprising given Q1 really started to rebound off of the zero-COVID policies, and there was government stimulus, and all of a sudden, Q2 really slowed down significantly. And when I think about that, and then we're assuming that for the full year, right, in terms that it's going to continue. We've seen customer caution. I mean, I think every business, when I say, and this is above life science tools and diagnostics, businesses have been cautious this year on spend, and it certainly manifested itself more meaningfully in Q2, particularly in biotech.\nWhen I think about it, about a point of our change in the growth outlook comes from China, about three points of it comes from customer caution, and within it, bioproduction is about a point or 1/3 of the customer caution aspect, 2/3 across the rest of the business. Versus sort of what the Analyst Day and sort of the view in May, we saw China certainly soft throughout the quarter. In our business, the final month of a quarter is actually quite meaningful across all of our businesses. So while we certainly saw some customer caution in the beginning of the Q2, June saw no bounce at all, right? So it just was kind of flat through the quarter.\nSo therefore, we just didn't see that view, which is why we've adjusted the outlook at this point in time.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. That's very helpful color. Thanks, Marc. And then just for my follow-up, just on the AI segment and instruments, could you maybe just, given the visibility you might have into sort of the back half of this year, talk about sort of what the backlog looks like, order growth, and how you're feeling about sort of the moderation in instrument growth in the back half of this year that you talked about earlier this year?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah, Matt, thanks for the question. So when I think about instruments, we obviously entered the year with a strong backlog, and we entered the quarter with a strong backlog, and the 10% growth is a very strong performance.\nOrders were definitely softer than we expected in Q2, primarily driven by China, which is a large component of the business there. And therefore, I would say we would expect that the growth rate would become more muted as the year unfolds in the analytical instruments business as we continue to work down the backlog. Thank you, Matt.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Arias\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Stephen, on the PPI commentary and just being able to leverage that, can you expand on that a little bit? I mean, should we take that to mean just sort of pressing harder on being lean in areas where you've done that in the past, or is that more pulling some levers that haven't been fully pulled, so to speak?\nThen relatedly, the EPS guide only came in about 5% or so at the midpoint. So how do we think about mix as a factor there, and how much room do you think that's left to you given the uncertainty that you're looking at in the back half?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So, Dan, I'll explain on the PPI side, and then I'll get onto the kind of the EPS view. So it's on PPI that what we do is how we run the company.\nSo this is about the first thing you do when you think about economic conditions being different and activity levels being different with our customers is prioritization in terms of what we're working on and deprioritize areas which may be less important, push things out as appropriately, and then make sure that we're investing in the right areas that we should be investing in and not titrating back any spending where that really matters. So it's about prioritizing where we're spending our time and what we're working on. And part of that then is then reduction in discretionary spending, reduction in activity levels in certain areas, and these PPIs build to help us do that and put that into operation. Use the company scale in terms of the levers and sourcing, particularly in indirects.\nYou can lean on those levers when economic conditions aren't as strong, and that's definitely a way of getting some of the benefits. And then when we think about the expected slightly lower volumes, we're optimizing our manufacturing operations appropriately, and generally across our businesses, we're appropriately reducing headcount where that makes sense across the business. And so all of that wraps up into $450 million of benefit this year, and those actions have pretty much all been action right now in terms of there's nothing significant to come. It's more we've taken the appropriate actions given the environment that we see. Then in terms of some of the backup of the year, we're sort of with your question around the phasing of EPS or the range of EPS. Could you just clarify?\n\nDan Arias\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nI guess it was a little bit of both.\nI mean, organic growth is going from high singles to potentially low singles, and the EPS only actually came in a pretty modest amount. So I was just wondering how much room you think you've given yourself given your PPI comments, whether you're, I guess the answer is you're comfortable with it, but how comfortable actually are you given the range of outcomes in the back half?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So we provided a range of outcomes and was to talk about what the market conditions could be. And when we think about what the pull-through would be on the revenue and that range of outcomes plus the activities of working on the cost side, I think that's an appropriate range for EPS.\nAnd then the phasing, first half, second half, clearly a higher adjusted operating income margin in the second half of the year, and that's really largely driven by the impact of the cost actions. So of the $450, $75 million impacted the first half, and you'll have $375 million of benefit in the second half. And then revenue is a little bit more weighted when you look at the year as a whole to the second half versus the first half. That's the other piece that drives the profitability in EPS difference. Thanks, Dan.\n\nDan Arias\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nYep. Okay. Helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Marc, maybe one on - thanks for all the color on the assumptions around the guide change.\nWhen you look at the quarter, maybe can you talk about how things progressed? I think China was down low teens, overall organic underlying organic was 2%. Did things worsen throughout the quarter? Because I think the implied guidance for back half is low singles, 2%-ish at the midpoint. So we're just wondering if the exit rate was around 2%-ish or is the back half assuming some improvement from the exit rate levels of Q2?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYes. So Vijay, in terms of the phasing of the quarter, I think really what was different was June saw none of the normal quarter-end patterns. So it was very similar to April and May. In my many years of doing this, that's unusual, actually, where the last month isn't a big step up in activity. That's just sort of the pattern of the industry a bit.\nOur assumption for the year is effectively that the market conditions that we saw in Q2, in aggregate for Q2, continues to play out for the balance of the year. You have all sorts of different comparisons within the different businesses versus the prior year and so forth. We felt that the 0% to 2% market growth, and for us, for the full year, the 2% to 4% core growth would be an appropriate performance. I think maybe the best color that I can give you is sort of how we think about it, right? Our best view on what happened in the market is informed by looking at all of the competitors, peers that reported in Q1. Obviously, that goes well into May.\nAll of our internal data about what's going on in the market, our extensive dialogue with customers, and the few companies that reported so far, right? So that informs the 0% to 2%. The way we think about this and the standard is it's our job to gain market share. We put in 2 points of growth faster than that assumption. We're going to hold ourselves to that standard, meaning if we're too conservative on the market outlook, then we will have higher expectations of what good looks like in terms of the year. But that's our best view. When you look at the script and the comments that Stephen and I made, we made no comments about share gain in Q2 because when you deliver 2% growth, we're not going to pat ourselves on the back.\nAt least looking at the first few companies that have reported, it appears that our performance is actually quite good and that we're growing faster. There's a lot of companies that have to report, but it actually looks like on a relative basis, we actually had a solid quarter of growth. So hopefully, that gives you some context of where things are, but we're going to keep studying it and make sure we got a good handle on our performance. And when we end 2023, that we will be proud that we navigated the environment extremely well, delivered differentiated performance, and set the company up for long-term success.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's extremely helpful color, Marc. And maybe one follow-up here. The updated guidance, is it assuming China to remain in decline for the rest of the year? And what was PPD's growth in the quarter?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSo Vijay, the declines were lessened on a reported basis because of the run-up in testing, vaccines, and therapies, a little bit there in terms of the support for the pandemic that we did in the back half of the year last year. So we're assuming basically the same market conditions, not just China, but for the rest of the world as well, as we saw in Q2 for the remainder of the year. Clinical research, double-digit growth.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah. Fantastic. Thank you, guys.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Dan, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Marc, Jets are hoping Aaron Rodgers can navigate through a difficult schedule. Certainly hope and expect you'll navigate through these more difficult macro times here.\nMaybe just the first one. Would love to get more color on China. Could you just walk us through just more color across your major customer segments, kind of unpack kind of how the quarter played out from that perspective? And then specifically, would also love to hear color on bioproduction in China.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So in terms of China, when I think about it, we had decline on an organic basis, a little over 10%. Core was about flat in terms of it. And I'm just trying to give some flavor. So you obviously have the COVID testing. What we saw in China, and it was very different than what our team expected, what we expected. And if I think about that, that's an unusual comment coming from us.\nActually, our leadership team from China came to the US and had the opportunity to sit down and chat with them about what they are seeing? I'm heading over to China in a few weeks as well for a week. So it's an important market. It really does feel like it is broad economic based. We saw that across our different businesses, not limited to one. Clearly, bioproduction was soft in China, so consistent with some of the other comments that you've heard from others. But we saw the slowdown really cut across the portfolio, if you will, and seems to be economic activity. We always assume, \"Hey, are we doing something wrong? Are we losing share?\" All of those things, because I think that's sort of the PPI discipline, which is fact-based, hold yourself accountable to a high standard.\nAt least at what we're seeing, it just feels like customers got extraordinarily cautious in China, activity slowed, and it showed up across the portfolio. And while I haven't had a moment to distract myself on some fun activities, I look forward to at some point some football and seeing if the Jets actually make an improvement. Thanks.. I can't comment on the Jets. But when I think about China, it is way broader than life science tools. This is a Chinese economy. They're clearly having problems getting that economy back up and running post-COVID, and they have a history of being able to do that. But we're not counting on that for the remainder of the year as a way to frame it from a wider economic viewpoint. Thanks, Dan.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. And then maybe just on the end market, four to six, which you took down to zero to two right now under your planning for 2023, kind of from what you see today, is that zero to two the best starting point as we think about modeling out Thermo’s top line for 2024? You want to talk a little bit about Susan?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSVP and CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So just broadly on 2024, when I think about what you need to do to model a company going forward, two factors. One’s the jumping-off point for the 2023 margins and then what’s the macro conditions assumption you use for 2024. So obviously, on the macro, we’re assuming that the near-term conditions stay the same throughout the remainder of the year. You’ll need to make your own assumption around what that market growth is for next year.\nWe'll have more clarity on that when we get towards the end of this year and know what the macro conditions are like. So it's not macro within our industry. It's a macro in terms of the overall economic situation across the globe. So we'll have a clearer view on that towards the end of this year. As Marc said earlier, we'll hold ourselves to the standard of delivering a couple of points higher than what the market growth is when we think about that. So as you weave in what assumption you have, I think the assumption is we'll be driving a couple of points of share gain above that. And then from a margin standpoint, a normal assumption for the year would be to start with 50 basis points of expansion on top of what we just ended the year.\nAnd then when you think about my guide for this year, there will be some small benefit of carryover of the cost actions into 2023 as well. So that will help you think about the margin profile for 2024 at this point and provide you a more refined view on that when we give the guidance for 2024 in more detail. Thanks, Dan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Derik, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDerik de Bruin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Thank you and good morning. So Dan sort of asked some of the questions I wanted to talk to you about on 2024. I guess, Marc, what's your view that we're not entering a more prolonged downturn in the life sciences tools market?\nI'm just sort of thinking about this from a historical perspective when we've sort of seen some resets in the market, and it's taken a while for this to sort of wash through the system. So it's like, what's your confidence that we're not in a situation where we've got a period where the growth is going to be sort of back in that lower range?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So Derik, it's a great question. So if I step back from the crystal ball for a moment and say, what's the drivers here? This is an unbelievable industry with incredible tailwinds. And even since the Dnalyst Day, if you look at the progress on approved medicines that are going on and the cycle that that creates of more funding to fuel the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, it's extraordinarily encouraging for the long term, right?\nSo when I think about 4% to 6% market growth for the long term, as bullish as ever, right, in terms of that. When I think about the dynamics, most of what is going on is around the macroeconomic environment, not the life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, right, in terms of caution in the economy, credit availability, all of that cycle, higher interest rates, and therefore less funding going into higher growth businesses. All of that dynamic is a macro. Within our own industry, you clearly have the pandemic unwind, right, that that's shaking out. And as you look at the industry's numbers, and even if you look at our numbers, the pandemic-related activity will be relatively modest this year. So most of that will have washed out in the industry this year.\nSo when I think about 2024, as Stephen said, it's really going to be what's the macro, not the life sciences tools macro, that I think is the big driver. Because the science can be exquisite. There's going to be great things going on in pharma and biotech. There'll be great new discoveries. All of that will attract funding. And it's just a question of, is this a kind of stabilization year for the economy? And then it bounces. That's the bull case. Or is this a more prolonged period? And then that obviously is more of the bearish case on sort of what the macro is. And while we won't have a perfect crystal ball as we get into our guidance in 2024, we'll have a much better sense of what the conditions are we are navigating. Hopefully, that's helpful.\n\nDerik de Bruin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Yeah, it is. It is.\nSo, just to follow up on this, it's like how much of the pharma and biotech slowdown is just this digestion of the excess COVID spending? And clearly, there was frothy biotech markets and people worried about supply chain. So there was a lot of money that went into the system as people did this. How much is this just digesting that excess spend versus are you seeing new concerns? Are these customers seeing new concerns of a regulatory environment, drug pricing, and patent expirations? Are you seeing any signs in slowing clinical trial activity or higher cancellation rates? Just some sort of thought on what's just a hangover period from COVID versus new trepidation in the space.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nSure. So Derik, the way I would think about it is if you go back to the beginning of the year and sort of how we talked about our guidance, pharma and biotech, right? As a company, as a reminder, our core organic growth was 14% in 2022. Within that, vaccines and therapies were essentially flat. So actually, whatever, stripping that out, we actually grew faster than that. Pharma and biotech, incredibly strong in 2022. Our view was, while the market would be a good end market in 2023, that given the comparisons, it would moderate meaningfully. That's not a negative comment. It's just such an oversized growth, and our very strong growth in the prior year period; we knew that growth would slow. When you look at the Q2 results, you're flat and five points of headwind, which actually performed literally exactly as we had forecasted for the quarter.\nSo kind of 5% growth, excluding the sort of vaccine and therapy runoff this year. That gives you a sense of what the sort of base activity is in that market, which actually is reasonable. It's slower than some other periods, but given the comparison, it actually is a reasonable view. In terms of the color and all of those things, pharma is doing fine, right? I mean, in terms of what's happening there. And it's really biotech; every quarter that funding has been a little bit more challenged or not as strong as the past, companies get more conservative because they think about what's their runway on spending. And that really picked up in terms of the headwinds in Q2 against an incredibly difficult comparison in the prior year period.\nThe final point I would make here is that there are some green shoots starting to happen in biotech, right? In terms of new company formation, some of the funding, actually Q2 started to show some signs of positivity. That obviously takes a while to flow through the numbers, but actually that's an encouraging data point as well. Hopefully, that level of context gives you something on how to think about it.\n\nDerik de Bruin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks, Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nThanks, Derik.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from J.P. Morgan.Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nEquity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nPerfect. Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions this morning. So I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on that guidance cut and how you guys are bucketing where the cut was really coming from.\nSo you said that of the 400 basis points, one point was really from China, three points were around customer spending, with one of that coming from bioproduction. So can you just give us a bit more color on where the remaining two points of weaker customer spend is happening? It sounds like PPD growth was strong. So where else are you seeing weakness in the portfolio? And then also from an end market perspective, is this really all just weakness in pharma biotech, or is there some additional weakness in industrial, for example?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYes. So when I think about customer caution, sort of a macroeconomic view, you see that across all types of customers. So it's not limited to one segment.\nIt's more pronounced in biotech, but we saw it in some industrial customers, and certainly we saw it in some of the other customers that we serve, academic, and government, and so forth. So it's not limited to one view. In terms of the growth, where the impact and the change of growth is in the other segments, clearly, with our view, is that the instruments business will slow in the second half of the year. So that's probably one of the changes. And then some of the run rate activity that you would see in things like bioscience reagents or customer channels, which actually those are great businesses. We think customer will be a little bit more muted in spending. So it's really not pinned to one area, but just a spread across the portfolio, probably with instruments feeling the most of the impact. Okay.\nOperator, we're ready. We'll take one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about M&A. These dynamic times historically of a way of creating new opportunities. There's been a few larger assets talked about in the press. Just would love to get your thoughts. Do you expect to be active if something materialized?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. Jack, thanks for the question. So in terms of capital deployment and M&A, we've been active on return of capital, both with the increase in the dividend and the share buybacks earlier in the year. We've also been active on M&A with closing the Binding Site to start the year. We're excited about CorEvitas. And we have a lot of firepower, and we're very active, right?\nI do agree with your sentiment that in these periods, there are opportunities. So we're actively looking at a number of things. And we're only going to do transactions that fit our criteria, which is ultimately it's going to strengthen our offering from a customer perspective. It's going to clearly add shareholder value in terms of the returns that we generate from the transaction. So you'll see us be active. And whether that happens in terms of the second half of the year or into 2024, we're certainly busy is the way I would think about it.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGreat. I have one follow-up on pharma services. It sounds like that business grew faster than PPD this quarter. Can you talk about how the demand profile is holding up there? And I need to ask about the tornado that hit Rocky Mount.\nDoes that have any material impact on the market as you see it?\n\nMarc Casper\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nYeah. So pharma services, really strong performance in terms of growth, and the way you characterize it is accurate. So very strong growth in that business. When I think about new wins and some of the things that we're securing for the future, the team's doing a nice job of building out a strong backlog for the future. So that business is in a good spot. When I think about the tornado that hit in North Carolina, the good news is that nobody was injured, at least in our discussions with the customer. And they're assessing the issues from a market perspective. And we stand ready to help our customers as we do in any situation. And we never view that as a business opportunity.\nWe always view it as we have very material relationships with our customers, and our colleagues are there to support them, and we will support in any way that is helpful as they work through the natural disaster. So thank you, Jack, for the question. And thanks, everyone, for the questions today. Let me wrap up with thanks for joining us. We're very well positioned to deliver and continue to deliver differentiated performance, which we'll do. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we'll keep you updated on our progress. Thanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everybody, for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a lovely rest of your day."

My name is Charlie and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for today's call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVice President, Life Sciences Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com under the heading News and Events until May 12, 2023. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2023 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials.\nSo before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2023 earnings and also available in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financials. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Casper\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of very strong financial performance. Our core business is performing very well. I'm pleased with the team's great execution and the share gain we saw across our company, especially within the context of a slightly more challenging macro environment.\nOur continued success is the result of our proven growth strategy, the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers and our PPI business system which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company. So let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.71 billion, our adjusted operating income was $2.33 billion, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.03 per share.\nAt the beginning of the year, we set out appropriately ambitious guidance for 2023 and Q1 demonstrates that we're delivering against that. Let me turn to our end markets. We delivered very strong performance in Q1, driven by outstanding execution from our team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Pandemic-related activity performed as we had expected during the quarter. As a reminder, the impact of the headwind from the revenue runoff can be seen in pharma and biotech due to vaccines and therapies and in diagnostics and health care due to COVID-19 testing.\nLet me give you some color on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech. We delivered growth in the mid-single digits for the quarter. During the quarter, we had very strong performance in our pharma services, clinical research and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits in the quarter. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including chromatography and mass spectrometry, electron microscopy as well as the research and safety market channel. Academic and government demand was strong in all regions. In industrial and applied, we grew in the high single digits for the quarter.\nWe saw strong growth in all of our analytical instrument businesses, including electron microscopy, chemical analysis and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q1, revenue was approximately 45% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. I'll now turn to our proven growth strategy which enables us to continue to deliver differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our growth strategy consists of 3 pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.\nStarting with the first pillar, innovation. We had an excellent start to the year as we launched a number of high-impact new products across our businesses during the first quarter. These technologies are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to bring new ground in their important work. In elemental analysis, we launched the Thermo Scientific iCAP RQ Plus ICP-MS analyzer.\nThis ICP mass spectrometry system simplifies analysis of trace elements in complicated samples including the identification of heavy metals and soil in water as well as toxic elements in food and beverage. In Genetic Sciences we launched the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Absolute Q AutoRun dPCR suite, an automated digital PCR solution to increase productivity for molecular research including cell and gene therapy and cancer research. In our biosciences business, we launched the Invitrogen DynaGreen microplastic-free magnetic beads for protein purification.\nThis new product will help our customers to reduce the environmental impact of life science research and build on our long history of innovation and market leadership in bioscience reagents. And in our Clinical Diagnostics business, we launched the Thermo Scientific DRI tramadol assay, which broadens our extensive toxicology portfolio with a new drug of abuse assay to help fight the opioid crisis. These are just a few examples of the innovation going on across our company, and I'm excited about the robust pipeline of products that would be launched throughout the year.\nWe also recently learned that Thermo Fisher was ranked #22 on Fortune's Most Innovative Companies list. This is a new award launched in 2023 based on product and process innovation and the company's culture. A really nice recognition of our team and their track record. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets by opening a new Gibco cell culture rapid prototyping facility at our existing site in Suzhou, China.\nThis facility will help regional customers accelerate the transition of their cell culture media production into current good manufacturing practices. It will also ensure patients receive therapies manufactured at the highest level of safety, effectiveness, quality and purity. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I've had the opportunity to meet with dozens of our pharmaceutical and biotech customers since the beginning of the year, and our value proposition is clearly resonating.\nOur trusted partner status gives us an early understanding of customers' unmet needs and the ability to generate insights that allow for deep collaborations that continue to advance scientific breakthroughs. During Q1, we achieved an exciting milestone in our strategic partnership with the University of California, San Francisco, with the opening of a new cell therapy cGMP manufacturing and collaboration center to accelerate the development of breakthrough therapies for glioblastoma, multiple myeloma and other cancers.\nIn this facility, we offer UCSF and other customer solutions for cell therapy development from discovery to clinical research through to commercial manufacturing. Partnerships like this have the potential to transform clinical care. Another example of our customer value proposition and the trusted partner status that we have established with our pharma and biotech customers can be seen in the excellent performance of our clinical research business, which drove very strong growth in the quarter. I'm very excited by the revenue synergies that will drive both short-term and longer-term growth in the business.\nThe momentum is continuing to build and is benefiting both our clinical research business and other parts of the company. We're also working with very engaged customers on longer-term projects to explore ways to reduce the time and cost of bringing drugs to market. By bringing our capabilities and expertise within our pharma services and clinical research businesses together, we are working to improve the effectiveness of the drug development process, benefiting both our customers and their patients.\nWe have an exciting pilot underway that is utilizing dedicated resources and best-in-class technologies and capabilities to provide enhanced visibility and real-time data to the customer. This improves the speed of decision-making and reduces potential delays from development to manufacturing to clinical trials. It can also help our customers take cost out of the process by reducing waste in the clinical supply process. This is really a nice example of why we are the trusted partner.\nAs always, our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day, and it enables us to improve quality, productivity and the customer experience while also helping us to navigate a dynamic environment. You can see in the positive -- you can see the positive impact of our PPI Business System and our results in Q1. It has also allowed us to capitalize on the strong demand from customers for analytical instrumentation and has also helped us to effectively address the runoff in pandemic-related activity and appropriately manage our costs.\nMoving to capital deployment. We've had an active start to the year both in strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We closed the acquisition of the binding side at the beginning of the year. It's great to have this business now as part of the company. The business is a fantastic fit with our Specialty Diagnostics business, and we're leveraging our capabilities to take an excellent business and make it even better. The integration is going very smoothly, and the business is performing very well, tracking ahead of plan.\nOur team is focused on advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and immune disorders and the innovation pipeline looks great. We're excited by the opportunity to further advance patient care in this area. In terms of return of capital during the quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of stock and increased our dividend by 17%. So overall, a great start of the year from capital deployment.\nDuring the quarter, we also advanced our environmental, social and governance priorities, including securing agreements to power all current U.S. sites with 100% renewable energy by 2026. This is a significant contribution to our 2030 commitment to a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. As we continue to transition away from fossil fuels and adopt renewable energy, we're also accelerating our progress towards our commitment to net 0 carbon emissions by 2050.\nWe'll be releasing our latest corporate social responsibility report later this quarter and will give our stakeholders a really substantive view on our continuous improvement and the positive impact that we're having. Let me now turn to our guidance. Since the beginning of the year, the macro environment has become slightly more challenging. We're stepping up to that challenge and our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI business system is enabling us to maintain our ambitious full year outlook with revenues of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $23.70.\nStephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. Our very strong results in Q1 were driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well. Our unique customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status and we're continuing to gain market share. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and shareholders.\nAnd we're incredibly well positioned to deliver differentiated performance and excellent 2023 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. And good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we started the year with a very strong Q1, our growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System is enabling us to continue to very effectively navigate the company through a dynamic macro environment, manage the runoff in pandemic-related revenue and drive excellent core organic revenue growth and share gains.\nIn the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included 6% core organic revenue growth, we delivered $5.03 of adjusted EPS. Our core organic revenue growth was 1% higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, and adjusted EPS was $0.02 ahead. So a very strong start to the year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. So beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.03 of adjusted EPS in Q1. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.32. On the top line, reported revenue was 9% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue included 8% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 2% from foreign exchange.\nPandemic-related revenue came in as we expected in Q1. This is comprised of $140 million of testing revenue and $180 million of vaccines and therapies revenue. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6%. As a reminder, core organic revenue growth continues to include the change in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue which was a headwind of approximately 3% in the quarter. So very strong core performance, showing the continued strength of our business.\nTurning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region is skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q1, North America declined high single digits, Europe declined in the low double digits, Asia Pacific grew in the low single digits, with China declining slightly and rest of World declined high single digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 32% and adjusted operating margin was 21.8%, 740 basis points lower than Q1 last year.\nIn the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity. This is more than offset by lower pandemic-related revenue and continued strategic investments. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 40.3%, 720 basis points lower than Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.3% of our revenue. Total R&D expense was $350 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation.\nR&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 6.9% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $154 million, which is $36 million higher than Q1 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. This is 410 basis points lower than Q1 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were $388 million in Q1, approximately $6 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution.\nTurning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $730 million, free cash flow for Q1 was $280 million after investing $450 million in net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we deployed $5.8 billion of capital. This included $3.7 billion for the acquisition of The Binding Site and $3.1 billion of capital return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9x on a net debt basis.\nConcluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, reflecting the strong returns on investments that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment. Net revenue was significantly higher in the prior year, so that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins.\nWe continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in this segment declined 38% and organic revenue was 37% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year-ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 62% and adjusted operating margin was 32%, down 19 percentage points versus prior year quarter.\nIn the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher pandemic-related revenue in Q1 2022. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q1 and organic growth was 17%. The strong growth was broad-based in the segment this quarter, led by chromatography and mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 40% and adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, up 460 basis points year-over-year.\nIn the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through, strong productivity and favorable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1, reported revenue declined 25% and organic revenue was 28% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter.\nQ1 adjusted operating income decreased 21% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 25.3%, which is 140 basis points higher than Q1 2022. During the quarter, we delivered favorable business mix and strong productivity, which was partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume. Finally, in the Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 6%, and organic growth was 7%. During Q1, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services and clinical research businesses.\nQ1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, which is 240 basis points higher than Q1 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through. This is partially offset by strategic investments. Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're maintaining our guidance for full year 2023 consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion, including 7% core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. There's no net change overall in our guidance but how we expect to achieve this guidance is different from the way we planned at the start of the year, and it demonstrates our ability to effectively navigate the dynamic macro environment and maintain a very strong financial outlook.\nSince our initial guide we see $0.25 of additional headwinds to adjusted EPS, $0.15 from business mix and $0.10 from FX. We're actively offsetting all of this headwind, about $0.20 through cost management and $0.05 through actions below the line. So no net change overall. The PPI Business System is enabling us to navigate the company very effectively through a dynamic macro environment. As I mentioned, the 2023 guidance reflects a very strong financial outlook. Let me remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions that remain unchanged from the previous guidance.\nWe continue to assume 7% core organic revenue growth from market growth of 4% to 6%. Within our core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3% impact on core organic revenue growth. It's worth noting that the majority of our vaccine and therapy revenue in 2023 is expected to be in our Pharma Services business. With regards to testing revenue, we continue to assume $400 million for 2023. We're assuming the binding site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth this year.\nBelow the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. We continue to assume that net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023, and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. Our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares. And we're assuming we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022.\nSo turning now to the assumptions that have changed. As I mentioned earlier, our FX assumption for the year has changed. We still expect FX to be a tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million or 0.2%. However, we now expect it to be a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.06. That's $0.10 more of a headwind than the previous guidance due to changes in rates and the expected mix of our currencies.\nGuidance assumes adjusted operating margins for 2023 to be in the range of 23.8% to 23.9% for the year. The adjusted tax rate assumption has improved slightly from our initial guide, we now expect it to be 10.8% for the full year. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Compared to our initial phasing assumptions, we now expect a slightly higher weighting of revenue and adjusted EPS in the second half of the year.\nWe're currently assuming that the first half of the year represents approximately 48% of our full year revenue dollars and 44% of our full year adjusted EPS dollars. Q2 core organic growth is expected to be mid-single digits, probably best to model at a slightly lower than Q1. To conclude, we delivered a very strong start to the year, and we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVice President, Life Sciences Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.",

Casper\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results in Q4. And as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me.\nOur proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our customers. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals.\nOur ability to deliver these results in a year that included global supply chain disruptions, a war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and inflationary headwinds wouldn't be possible without the incredible dedication of our team around the world. I'm very grateful for our team's great execution in effectively navigating dynamic times and enabling the success of our company and our customers. Thanks to our colleagues, our company delivered a spectacular 2022. And I couldn't be more excited for 2023.\nI'll get into more of the details in my remarks later. But first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue grew 7% to $11.45 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.56 billion. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.40 per share.\nTurning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 15% to $44.92 billion in 2022. Adjusted operating income was $10.99 billion and adjusted EPS, $23.24 per share. Let me turn to our end markets. We continued to deliver excellent and differentiated performance in Q4. This was driven by a continuation of good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain.\nLet me now give you some color for the quarter and the year. Starting with our largest end market, pharma and biotech. We continued to deliver impressive performance with growth in the low-teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our pharma and biotech customers. Throughout the year, we had broad-based strength across our businesses serving this end market, highlighted by our bioproduction, pharma services, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as the research and safety market channel.\nIn academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including biosciences, electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as in the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low-teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. During the year, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses.\nAnd finally, in diagnostics and health care. In Q4, revenue was approximately 40% lower than the prior year quarter and 25% lower than full year 2021. The team delivered good core business growth during the year, led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses as well as our health care market channel.\nI'll now turn to our growth strategy, which is delivering differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.\nStarting with the first pillar. It was another terrific year of high-impact innovation as we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, our innovations are accelerating our customers' research and unlocking deeper analytical insights.\nIn 2022, we extended our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer to advance proteomics, metabolomics and cancer biomarker research. We also launched the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial and pharmaceutical applications.\nIn electron microscopy, the new Thermo Scientific Glacios 2 Cryo-TEM was launched during the fourth quarter. It will help our customers accelerate structure-based drug discovery for debilitating disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases as well as research for cancer and gene mutations.\nWe also continue to build on our genetic sciences capabilities to help our customers understand, diagnose and treat disease. During the fourth quarter, our SeCore CDx HLA Sequencing System was granted marketing authorization by the U.S. FDA for use as a companion diagnostic with a T cell receptor therapy for adults with ocular melanoma.\nThis is a really nice example of how our Specialty Diagnostics business is benefiting from our capabilities in Life Sciences Solutions. In addition, we expanded our PCR test menu to leverage our incredibly large installed base of instruments and launched the TrueMark Infectious Disease Research Panels for rapid detection and research of infectious disease pathogens.\nTo wrap up the innovation highlights, we added to our cell and gene therapy offering, most recently launching the Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation System. Our solutions are helping customers advance their cell and gene therapy programs. So another spectacular year of innovation. And we have an exciting pipeline of launches in 2023 and beyond.\nThe second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continued to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets during the year. And I'll highlight a recent example. In the quarter, we opened a new cGMP biologics and sterile manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, China, which provides integrated clinical and commercial drug substance and drug product capabilities to help customers in China and in the Asia-Pacific region deliver patient therapies more quickly.\nTurning to the third pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities. We've been executing on the significant investments we've made over the past couple of years. And throughout 2022, we brought new capacity and capabilities online for pharma services, bioproduction and clinical research services. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab in Richmond, Virginia to support our clinical research business and the increasing demand for our laboratory services to accelerate drug development.\nAs always, our PPI Business System enabled our success during the year. It's helping us to drive meaningful share gain, maximize the return on investments, meet our customers' needs and successfully navigate a dynamic environment, including effectively addressing inflation and global supply chain challenges. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and enables outstanding execution.\nWe continue to successfully execute our capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and return of capital to our shareholders. In 2022, we successfully integrated PPD, our clinical research business. For the full year, PPD delivered core organic growth in the high-teens, generating over $7 billion in revenue and contributing over $2 to our adjusted earnings per share.\nThe combination of a great per share performance and excellent progress on our synergy realization is delivering very strong returns for our shareholders that is well ahead of the deal model. From a customer lens, the acquisition has further elevated our trusted partner status as customers are realizing significant value in partnering with our team to advance a scientific idea to an approved medicine.\nIn 2022, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. And on the first business day of 2023, we completed the acquisition of The Binding Site, a leading specialty diagnostics company. The Binding Site is an exciting addition and highly complementary to our Specialty Diagnostic business. Together, we'll be able to advance the diagnosis and management of patients afflicted with multiple myeloma and immune disorders.\nReflecting on our progress of our ESG priorities in 2022, we further advanced our environmental and philanthropic efforts while also continuing to strengthen our company culture. During the year, we continued to advance our environmental sustainability road map, reducing our carbon emissions and finalizing significant power purchasing agreements to accelerate our transition towards 100% renewable energy. Looking forward, we've also increased our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to achieve a 50% reduction in this decade.\nThrough our Foundation for Science, we continued to advance our philanthropic efforts and supported students across the globe during the year with our STEM education programs. This included an announcement in the quarter for the Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge, the premier middle school STEM competition in the U.S.\nAnd throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was recognized for its industry leadership and inclusive culture. This includes earning 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign 2022 Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ equality for the seventh consecutive year as well as inclusion on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. In the quarter, we were recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the World's Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of America's Best Employers For Veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. 2022 is a special year for Thermo Fisher. And I'm excited about 2023 and beyond.\nStephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance. But let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating 2023 revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70 per share. This very strong financial outlook reflects a continuation of our track record of delivering excellent financial performance and sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders.\nSo to summarize our key takeaways for 2022. Our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals while navigating a very dynamic macro environment. And we enter 2023 with strong momentum, and we're incredibly well positioned beyond 2023.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an outstanding quarter, capping off another excellent year.\nFor the quarter and the full year, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth. This differentiated level of performance demonstrates the power of our growth strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. In addition, in Q4, we generated $370 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $3.1 billion for the full year.\nTaking a step back and thinking about the top line performance for the year, I'm really proud of what the team delivered. We offset $4.2 billion less testing revenue, which was a headwind of over 10%, and still delivered slightly positive organic growth for the year. That's a great accomplishment.\nThen using the power of the PPI Business System, we were able to translate the top line strength to excellent adjusted EPS and cash flow results. In Q4, we delivered $0.23 more adjusted EPS than our prior guide, ending the year at $23.24 and delivered $6.94 billion of free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in the business to enable an even brighter future. So 2022 was another excellent year.\nLet me now provide you with some details on our performance. Beginning with the earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.40 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $23.24 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.01 and $17.63 for the full year.\nOn the top line, as I mentioned, in Q4, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth of $370 million of testing revenue. Reported revenue grew 7% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 3% lower organic revenue, a 14% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. The full year core organic revenue growth was 14%. And we delivered $3.1 billion in testing revenue. For the full year 2022, reported revenue increased 15%. This includes slightly positive organic growth, an 18% contribution from acquisitions and a 3% headwind from foreign exchange.\nTurn to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in 2022 and the prior year. In Q4, North America grew in the low single digits; Europe declined in the low-teens; Asia Pacific in the mid-single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits; and the rest of the world declined high single digits.\nFor the full year, North America grew in the low single digits; Europe declined high single digits; Asia Pacific grew high single digits, including China, which also grew high single digits for the year; and the rest of the world declined high single digits. On a core organic growth basis, all regions had strong growth in 2022.\nWith respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, 710 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 24.5%, which is 650 basis points lower than 2021.\nFor both the fourth quarter and full year, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also delivering strong productivity. This was more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. For 2022, full year adjusted operating margin was 40 basis points lower than assumed in the prior guidance. 2/3 of this was due to business and currency mix and 1/3 due to one-time costs related to the runoff of testing revenue.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.4%, 910 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 43.5%, down 810 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6% of revenue, an improvement of 170 basis points versus Q4 2021. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.8% of revenue, an improvement of 130 basis points compared to 2021. Total R&D expense was $390 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.5 billion, representing 5% growth over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7% in Q4, 6.4% for the full year.\nLooking at results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $119 million, which is $31 million favorable to Q4 last year. Net interest expense for the full year was $454 million, a decrease of $39 million from 2021. Adjusted other income expenses was a net expense in the quarter of $10 million compared to net income of $7 million in Q4 2021. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in nonoperating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $14 million, which is $24 million lower than the prior year.\nOur adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, which is 100 basis points lower than Q4 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 13% or 160 basis points lower than 2021. We repurchased $1 billion of shares in Q4, bringing our total repurchases for 2022 to $3 billion. Average diluted shares were 393 million in Q4, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution.\nTurning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $9.15 billion. Free cash flow for the year was $6.94 billion after investing $2.2 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and $455 million for the full year. We ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and $34.5 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 13.5%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company.\nNow I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varied by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment margins. We're executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business. And that resides in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. The anniversary date of the acquisition was December 8.\nMoving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 27% and organic revenue was 24% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation in testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 13% and organic revenue declined 12%.\nQ4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 34.1%, down 14 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In Q4, we had unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher testing revenue in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 41.2%, a decrease of 880 basis points versus 2021.\nIn the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q4 and organic growth was 14%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 9% and organic revenue increased 14%.\nQ4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 25% and adjusted operating margin was 25.4%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 310 basis points versus 2021.\nTurning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue declined 23% and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our health care market channels and our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment decreased 16% and organic revenue was 13% lower than 2021.\nQ4 adjusted operating income decreased 30% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, down 190 basis points versus Q4 2021. During the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by the impact of lower testing volume. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 21.5%, down 110 basis points versus 2021.\nAnd finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. Q4 reported revenue increased 42%, organic growth was 11% and the impact of acquisitions was 35%. During Q4, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services business. PPD, our clinical research business, continued to perform very well. And during the quarter, it delivered over 20% core organic revenue growth and contributed $1.9 billion of revenue to the segment. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic revenue increased 10%.\nQ4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 73% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, which is 260 basis points higher than Q4 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix and delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through that was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 56% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, up 40 basis points versus 2021.\nLet me now turn to our 2023 guidance. As Marc outlined, we're starting the year with a very strong financial outlook, consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. Let me provide some details of the underlying assumptions, starting with revenue. Our initial guidance for 2023 assumes 7% core organic revenue growth, $400 million in testing revenue, $250 million of revenue from acquisitions and a tailwind of $100 million from FX. This all assumes a return to more normal market growth conditions in 2023 in the range of 4% to 6%.\nWithin our core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than 2022, a 3% impact on core organic growth. Even with this headwind, we are expecting to deliver 7% core organic revenue growth in 2023, demonstrating the strength of our initial outlook, the agility with which we're managing the business and the ongoing benefits of our growth strategy.\nTurning to profitability. In 2023, we're assuming an adjusted operating margin of 23.9%. This is 60 basis points lower than 2022, driven by 2 elements: a 40 basis points of core margin expansion; and 100 basis point headwind from the runoff of testing revenue. The year-over-year margin change is consistent with the comments I made on the last earnings call, when I described how to model the margin impact to the different elements of the year-over-year change in revenue.\nIn 2023, with the pandemic-related testing revenue behind us, I thought this would be a good opportunity to take a step back and take a multiyear view on our meaningful margin expansion progression. During -- starting in 2019 pre pandemic, excluding the impact of PPD, we're on track to expand operating margins 60 basis points a year on average through 2023, a 250 basis point improvement over the 4-year period. So great progress on margin expansion.\nTurning to adjusted EPS. We expect to deliver $23.70 in 2023. This is a 2% year-over-year increase, consisting of a 10% headwind from testing, more than offset by a 12% increase driven by the core business. We're actively managing the whole P&L to effectively deal with the material runoff in testing and vaccines and therapies revenue and still grow our adjusted earnings per share for the year. This shows the strength of our growth strategy and the power of our PPI Business System.\nMoving on to some more detailed assumptions behind the guide. With regards to FX, in 2023, we're assuming there's a year-over-year tailwind of approximately $100 million of revenue, or 0.2%, and $0.04 of adjusted EPS, also 0.2%. We're assuming that The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth and $0.07 to adjusted EPS in 2023.\nBelow the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. This is approximately $25 million higher than 2022 and includes the funding for The Binding Site acquisition. We assume that the adjusted income tax rate will be 11% in 2023. The improvement from 2022 is driven by a tax planning initiative. We're expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year.\nIn terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count of approximately 388 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures.\nAnd finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are all expected to ramp up as we go through the year. This is due to several factors. Core organic revenue growth is expected to increase as we go through the year, largely due to the comps related to vaccines and therapies as well as the expected phasing of economic activity in China. The impact of the runoff in testing revenue is most pronounced in Q1. And the benefits of the offsetting cost actions are spread over the year.\nFrom a foreign exchange standpoint, while a slight tailwind for the year as a whole, in Q1, FX is expected to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $200 million of revenue and $80 million of adjusted operating income. Below the line, net interest expense is expected to decrease during the year as we generate free cash flow and earn interest on that cash build. Putting all this together, for Q1, we expect core organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, adjusted operating margin to be slightly lower than Q4 2022 and adjusted EPS to be just over 20% of the full year total.\nSo to wrap up, we had an excellent 2022, and we're really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.",

(Operator Instructions) I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News & Events until November 11, 2022. A copy of the press release of our third quarter 2022 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials.\nSo before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2022 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials.\nSo with that, I'll now turn over the call to Marc.\n\nMarc N. Casper\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance. Our core business is performing incredibly well and demonstrating broad-based strength, and this is allowing us to raise our guidance once again for the full year.\nAs I reflect on our performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I'm very proud of our team's great execution, effectively navigating dynamic times and continuing to drive market share gains. Our ongoing success is driven by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System, and I'll talk about that more later.\nSo let me recap the Q3 financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.68 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.08 per share.\nTurning to our end markets. As we saw in the second quarter, we had a continuation of strong performance in Q3. This was driven by good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain.\nLet me now give you some additional color. Starting with pharma and biotech, we delivered outstanding performance with growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across the businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. Our differentiated customer value proposition is resonating with our customers and helping to further elevate our trusted partner status.\nIn academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in our biosciences and electron microscopy businesses.\nTurning to industrial and applied. We grew in the high teens for the quarter. We have broad-based strength across all of our analytical instrument businesses serving these customers.\nAnd finally, in diagnostics and health care. As expected, our revenue was approximately 30% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, we delivered good core business growth, led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses.\nSo now let me turn to our growth strategy, which has enabled another quarter of excellent performance. The investments we've made over the past few years are fueling growth and generating strong returns. As a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.\nLet me start with innovation. Our focus on high-impact innovation enables our customers to address some of the world's greatest challenges. We further strengthened our position in Q3, and I'd like to give you just a few highlights.\nDuring the quarter, we advanced our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer during the International Mass Spectrometry Conference. This instrument provides faster, more sensitive sample analysis for proteomics and metabolomics research and insights into clinically relevant biomarkers implicated in cancer.\nIn electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Arctis Cryo-Plasma Focused Ion Beam, an automated microscope that streamlines cryo-electron tomography. This instrument will help provide more insights into how proteins and other molecules operate within cells, enabling breakthroughs in treatment for infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.\nWe also continue to advance our clinical next-gen sequencing portfolio to help our customers better understand, diagnose and treat cancer. We recently launched the Oncomine Dx Express Test and Oncomine Reporter Dx software, a precision medicine offering which detects genomic abnormalities in tumor samples and helps match cancer patients with approved therapies and clinical trials.\nThese products recently received CE-IVD certification and are designed to run on our Ion Torrent Genexus Next-Generation Sequencing System, allowing doctors to use NGS technology to improve care by bringing the power of precision medicine closer to patients.\nAnother key pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. It's all about leveraging the incredible capabilities we have across our company and delivering them in a way that enables our customers to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity. And that makes it rational for them to do more business with us.\nThe accelerated investments we've made over the past couple of years are driving growth. This is particularly true for our pharma and biotech customers, where we continue to build on our trusted partner status as we bring our new capacity and capabilities online to meet the strong demand for our products and services.\nLet me share a couple of examples. During the quarter, we opened a purification technologies facility in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. This site will manufacture resin beads used in the production of biologics. As you know, we have a rapidly growing purification business, which is highly valued by our customers. This new facility will ensure we can meet their increasing demand.\nWe also continue to strengthen our global pharma services network, adding viral vector manufacturing capabilities in Plainville, Massachusetts. I joined the opening of this facility, and it was a terrific event. We had significant attendance from our customers, and we were able to showcase the various ways in which our team can support their cell and gene therapy programs.\nThe facility also utilizes and showcases our industry-leading single-use bioprocessing technologies and analytical instruments, which demonstrates to our pharma and biotech customers the uniqueness of our capabilities and how they can best utilize in bringing new medicines to market. So these are just a couple of examples that demonstrate how we're continuing to build our trusted partner status and further strengthen our unique customer value proposition. Our pharma biotech customers are capitalizing on this, which also includes PPD, our clinical research business. I'll cover that later in my remarks.\nBefore turning to an update on capital deployment, I thought I'd briefly reflect on the impact of our growth strategy in 2022. As you know, the actions we've taken over the last few years have allowed us to meaningfully accelerate our organic growth and position us to continue our long-term industry-leading performance.\nThe product launches this year have been truly outstanding, and the pipeline, it looks fantastic. The new capabilities that we have invested in have meaningfully strengthened our unique customer value proposition, and our customers are continuing to expand their relationship with us. All of this is enabling us to deliver industry-leading core growth.\nLet me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders.\nThe acquisition of PPD is a great example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value. The business is performing incredibly well, delivering high teens core revenue growth in the quarter. The combination of a great business and a smooth integration is driving excellent financial performance.\nIn addition, our customers are excited by the capabilities we have to support their clinical trial needs, and that is translating into meaningful revenue synergies for an even brighter future. All of this is enabling us to drive short- and long-term returns on the acquisition that are well ahead of the deal model.\nLet me spend a moment on our PPI Business System, which helps us continually improve the customer experience, quality, productivity in our company overall. The goal of PPI is to find a better way every day. This is an essential element of our company culture.\nIn dynamic times, we really see the strength of our PPI Business System. As you know, it was applied with incredible impact to allow us to lead the response to the pandemic. And today, it's applied to solve supply chain challenges, increase efficiency and helps our teams find better ways to offset inflation. It also enhances our ability to unlock the value creation in our acquisitions.\nOur experienced management team, along with the benefit of our scale and our PPI Business System, uniquely position the company to successfully navigate through whatever macroeconomic conditions come our way. So overall, it was another fantastic quarter, thanks to great execution by our teams, the strength of our proven growth strategy and the power of our PPI Business System.\nTurning to our progress on our environmental, social and governance priorities. During the quarter, we continued to make great progress on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint, announcing an agreement with Enel North America to purchase wind power renewable electricity equal to half of our U.S. electricity needs. This agreement will significantly advance our ambitious emissions reduction strategy.\nI'm also very pleased that we have achieved our 2020 commitment to hire 500 graduates from the historically black colleges and universities, supporting our commitment to diversity and inclusion and increasing our positive social impact. So another strong quarter in progressing our ESG priorities.\nNow I'd like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Steve will take you through the details. We are raising our full year guidance. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $650 million to $43.8 billion, which would result in 12% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we're raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08 to $23.01 per share.\nThe higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and a modest impact of additional COVID-19 testing. These are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds and demonstrate how well we're operating with speed at scale to enable our customer success.\nIn addition, our guidance reflects the decision to help our colleagues with the temporary impact of inflation, and we'll be making a onetime payment of approximately 1 week's additional salary to nonexecutive colleagues.\nSo to summarize our key takeaways in the third quarter, our outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date reflect our team's excellent execution, the benefits of our proven growth strategy and the positive impact of our PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well, and markets continue to be strong. We're gaining market share.\nWe're seeing the benefits of our accelerated investments in innovative new products and enhanced capabilities and capacity. In addition, our clinical research business has delivered excellent results, and customers are valuing the benefit of our expanded offering.\nAnd our experienced management team, the benefits of our scale and our PPI Business System uniquely position us to continue to navigate the dynamic times we're living in. All of this has enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022 again and further solidify our incredibly bright future.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. This includes 14% core organic revenue growth from $5.08 of adjusted earnings per share.\nRevenue in Q3 was approximately $800 million higher than we'd incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with just over $600 million driven by another quarter of extremely strong core organic growth, just over $200 million from additional COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by a small additional headwind from FX. So continue strengthening the core once again broad-based across businesses and end markets.\nIn terms of adjusted EPS, our PPI Business System enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat. And after accruing $0.18 of additional compensation in the quarter to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation, we delivered $0.36 of adjusted EPS higher than included in our previous guidance. So Q3 was another quarter of excellent financial performance.\nLet me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results. And as I mentioned, we delivered $5.08 of adjusted EPS in Q3. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.79. On the top line in Q3, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth and $440 million of testing revenue.\nReported revenue grew 14% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increase included 1% lower organic revenue, a 20% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 5% from foreign exchange.\nTurning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q3, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined 10%. Asia Pacific grew in the low single digits with China growing high single digits, and rest of the world declined high single digits.\nWith respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, 760 basis points lower than Q3 last year.\nIn the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity. This is more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. The company's adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.7%, 970 basis points lower than Q3 last year.\nFor the third quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. After factoring in the decision we took to accrue the additional colleague compensation that I mentioned earlier, both adjusted operating margin and adjusted gross margin came in as we had anticipated in our prior guidance.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.2% of revenue, a decrease of 170 basis points versus Q3 2021. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million in Q3, and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 6.7%.\nLooking at results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $106 million. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.8%. This was 240 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The Q3 rate was 75 basis points lower than we assumed in the quarter in the prior guide due to the timing of discrete tax planning items between Q3 and Q4, with no net change for the year overall. Average diluted shares were 395 million in Q3, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution.\nTurning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $5.7 billion, and free cash flow was $4 billion. Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well, and the year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.7 billion.\nWe returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and $29.2 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.1x on a net debt basis.\nConcluding my comments on our total company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 15.2%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company.\nNow to provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher than the prior year quarter but does skew some of the reported segment margins.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we're executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we outlined at the beginning of the year, we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business, and that resides in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment.\nSo moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 20%, and organic revenue was 17% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation in testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter.\nQ3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 43%. And adjusted operating margin was 35.1%, down 14 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and the strategic investments that we're making across the segment.\nIn the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 10% in Q3, and organic growth was 16%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was broad-based, led by chromatography and mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses.\nQ3 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 47%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.8%, up 600 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through, favorable business mix and strong productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments.\nTurning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q3, reported revenue declined 22%, and organic revenue was 19% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we saw a strong underlying growth in our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This is offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter.\nQ3 adjusted operating income decreased 29% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 21%, down 210 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered positive business mix and good productivity, which is more than offset by the impact of lower testing volumes.\nFinally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. In Q3, reported revenue increased 60%. Organic growth was 12%, and the impact of acquisitions was 53%. During Q3, we had strong growth in the pharma services business as well as the research and safety market channel.\nPPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well. And during the quarter, we delivered high teens core organic growth and contributed $1.82 billion of revenue to the segment. Q3 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 89%, and adjusted operating margin was 13%, which is 200 basis points higher than Q3 2021.\nIn the quarter, we drove favorable business mix, good productivity and also saw the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments.\nLet me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. As Marc outlined, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $650 million to $43.8 billion. This includes a raise in the core organic growth outlook for the year from 11% to 12%. And on the bottom line, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.08 to $23.01 per share.\nThe increase in the revenue guidance is driven by 3 elements: an increase of just over $600 million in the outlook for the core business, an increase of just over $200 million for COVID-19 testing revenue and a $200 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates. From a core organic revenue perspective, the strength of our performance is enabling us to raise our full year core organic revenue growth outlook from 11% to 12%, and there's no change in the assumptions for core organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to COVID-19 testing revenue. We now expect $2.8 billion of testing revenue for the year, which includes the assumption of an endemic run rate level of $100 million per quarter in Q4. Our Q4 testing assumption has not changed from our previous guidance.\nIn terms of adjusted EPS, the $0.08 raise for the year consists of $0.54 of operational beat in Q3, partially offset by the decision to pay $180 million or $0.36 of additional onetime colleague compensation. And half of this is accrued in Q3, and the remainder will be in Q4.\nThe full year guidance change also incorporates $0.10 lower EPS in Q4 for the additional FX headwind in the quarter and the revised phasing of our tax rate. All of this is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08, from $22.93 to $23.01, further improving a very strong outlook for the year.\nFrom a margin standpoint, we now expect the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 24.9%. To help you with your modeling, I think it's worth spending a moment on the impact of the inflationary environment on the company's financial profile.\nDuring the year, we've been very effective in passing on higher price to offset higher-than-normal inflation. This results in no net impact on our adjusted operating income dollars as we're effectively offsetting the added inflation, but it does affect the calculation of margins because of the revenue base being higher. The impact on margins for the full year from this dynamic is about 60 basis points, but again, no net impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS.\nSo now let me provide you with some additional details on the updated 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business, is expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 14% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business. We now expect the business to contribute $2.03 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance.\nIn terms of FX, we've incorporated current rates into our guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $1.46 billion on revenue or 3.7%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 is now expected to be $0.77 for the full year or 3.1%. Should FX rates stay the same as they are right now, we estimate the impact on FX in 2023 would be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1 billion on revenue and $0.75 on adjusted EPS.\nOur guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $440 million in 2022. We continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, which includes a 13.6% tax rate in Q4. We now expect net capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion.\nFor free cash flow, we see $7 billion at the high end of the range of outcomes for the year. The actual free cash flow will depend on the year-end level of working capital.\nOur guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is the $2 billion of share buybacks that we completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance also continues to assume that full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And to conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. We're in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.",

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials, SEC Filings.\nWhile we may like to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.\nAlso during this call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2022 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials.\nSo with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc N. Casper\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance. Our core business is performing very well, that strength is broad-based across all our businesses. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very proud of the team's great execution and the resulting share gain we saw across our business.\nOur ongoing success is propelled by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company. You'll see this in our second quarter results and increased outlook for the year.\nSo let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 18% year-over-year to $10.97 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.61 billion. Our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7%, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.51 per share.\nLet me now give you some color on our performance by end market. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had excellent performance in this end market, delivering growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. We're continuing to benefit from our trusted partner status that we've earned over many years with our pharma and biotech customers.\nIn academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in biosciences and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Turning to industrial and applied. We grew in the low double digits for the quarter. We saw very strong growth in electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry in our research and safety market channel.\nFinally, in diagnostics and health care, revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, the core business saw strong growth led by immunodiagnostics and microbiology. During the quarter, the team continued to execute well to support customers' COVID-19 testing needs. Overall, excellent performance across our end markets. And as that reflect on this quarter's performance, we continue to deliver very differentiated core business growth. This was driven by 3 factors: the market conditions were good; our team managed lockdowns in China extremely well; and we had outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain.\nLet me now provide an update on the progress we made in executing our proven growth strategy. The investments we've made and are continuing to make across the company are fueling growth and generating strong returns. Our growth strategy has enabled another quarter of excellent performance. As a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.\nI'll start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. I'll highlight a few of these. We had an outstanding American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, where we showcased new instruments, consumables and software to advance our customers' work. These included the Thermo Scientific AccelerOme Automated Sample Prep Platform, which simplifies workflows for proteomic researchers by eliminating the range of previously manual steps. We also launched a cloud-based Thermo Scientific RDS software platform, which integrates functionality and data across multiple chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments to simplify application-specific workflows, helping scientists share information with each other and labs around the world and speeding the development of new diagnostics and therapies.\nIn addition, we launched the Thermo Scientific Direct Mass Technology mode for our industry-leading Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometers. This technology allows for the characterization of complex and large biotherapeutics, which were previously challenging to interpret. In our biosciences business, we launched the Gibco CTS TrueCut Cas9 Protein that supports genome editing for applications such as CAR-T cell therapy research. Emerging therapies like CAR-T are providing new hope in treating cancer.\nAnd in specialty diagnostics, we launched the Phadia 2500+ series in the U.S., a high-throughput instrument for allergy and autoimmune diagnostics that help further improve lab efficiency. These new products and many others will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth for our company.\nTurning to our high growth and emerging markets. We're really thrilled with our team's progress. You may remember that we called out China as a potential Q2 headwind because of the COVID-19 lockdowns in the country. Obviously, the lockdowns were very severe, but I'm so proud of the way the team responded. They powered through demonstrating the relevance of our offering amid the crisis and delivered over 20% growth. That was the result of a very strong core business, the benefit of deep relationships we have with our customers and our support for local COVID-19 testing. So overall, it was a great quarter and one that clearly demonstrates our growth strategy continues to deliver outstanding results.\nThe third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. Our capabilities enable our customers' ability to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity. To be the best partner for our customers, we continue to enhance our capacity and capabilities.\nLet me share a couple of examples. At our flagship facility for cell culture media in Grand Island, New York, we just completed a capacity expansion to support customers' research, drug development and production applications. And in our lab chemicals business in Geel, Belgium, where we have our primary Continental European distribution center for lab chemicals, we just completed a major expansion of the facility to support the strong growth that we've been delivering.\nI've had the opportunity to visit both sites a number of times, and it's really exciting to see the ongoing strength in customer demand that's driving the need for this investment. These are just a few reflections on the way we're supporting our customers by further strengthening our capabilities and value proposition.\nNow turning to capital deployment. I'd like to share some of the other steps we've taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We're very pleased with the performance of the PPD acquisition. The business is performing very well, delivering strong core revenue and earnings growth.\nIn May, at our Investor Day, we increased the revenue synergy outlook by $100 million to $250 million in year 3 and the cost synergies in that year by $25 million to $100 million, and the synergy opportunities continue to be incredibly exciting. I just had a chance to meet with the clinical research commercial organization, and I'm so impressed with the team and the opportunity that they see for enabling the success of our customers going forward.\nThe combination of capabilities is really resonating with customers, and we're seeing strong momentum in the business. All of this is leading to business performance well ahead of ideal market. The acquisition of PPD is another example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value.\nTurning now to an update to our ESG initiatives. We released our latest Corporate Social Responsibility Report. This report details our progress and disclosures for all of our key ESG initiatives and is a great example of how we're continually working to enhance our reporting and disclosure using internationally recognized reporting standards. It's great to see the progress details in the report and also reflecting the progress we've made through our commitment to ESG over many years.\nFor this quarter, I'll highlight the progress we continue to make on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint. As part of our efforts, we continue to transition to renewable energy installed at on-site rooftop solar power at key locations to reduce our consumption of electricity produced with fossil fuels. We're also working with our suppliers on their climate performance goals would ultimately have an impact across our value chain. As a leader in ESG, our commitment to progress is ingrained in everything we do, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we go forward.\nNow I'd like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We're meaningfully raising our full year guidance. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion, which would result in 10% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we're raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 to $22.93 per share.\nThis higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and additional contribution of COVID-19 testing revenue, which are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds, demonstrating how well we operate with speed and scale to enable our customer success and navigate dynamic macro environments.\nSo to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter. Our outstanding results in Q2 had the benefits of our proven growth strategy, our PPI Business System and our extraordinary team. Our business is performing very well, and we're gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns. We're really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. And the team is doing an excellent job navigating the dynamic times we're living in. All of this has enabled to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q2. This included 13% core organic revenue growth, $630 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $5.51 of adjusted earnings per share and over $1 billion of free cash flow.\nRevenue in Q2 was $930 million higher than we'd incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $640 million driven by ongoing strength in the core business and $400 million from testing, partially offset by $110 million due to higher headwind from foreign exchange. Similar to last quarter, the strength in the core was broad-based across businesses and end markets.\nFrom a geographic lens, $200 million of the beat was from China. In our previous guidance, we'd assumed a $200 million headwind from the lockdowns in China, and we offset all of that, half from strong local core growth and half from local testing support, a great achievement by our China team.\nOur PPI Business System enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat and adjusted EPS for Q2 was $0.52 higher than included in our previous guidance. So Q2 was a continuation of our excellent financial performance track record.\nLet me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.51 of adjusted EPS in Q2, and GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.22. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 18% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth, a 19% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange.\nTurning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current year and prior year. In Q2, North America grew in the high single digits, Europe declined in the low double digits, Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits, with China growing over 20% and rest of world declined low double digits.\nWith respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 530 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Adjusted operating margin was slightly higher than we'd anticipated in our prior guidance for Q2, reflecting how our growth strategy and PPI Business System enabled us to continue to manage dynamic times.\nIn the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity and positive volume leverage in the core business. This was more than offset by the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and continued strategic investments, including investments in our colleagues.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 43.2%, 740 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the second quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.1% of revenue, a decrease of 180 basis points versus Q2 2021. The R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q2, representing growth of 6% over the prior year quarter. You can see the benefits of our prior R&D investments in our differentiated core organic growth rate and the exciting new products that Marc outlined. Moreover, the continued investments we're making in R&D are helping to fuel an even brighter future.\nLooking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $112 million, approximately flat to Q2 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%. This was 100 basis points lower than Q2 last year, driven by our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were 394 million in Q2, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution.\nTurning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $3.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and our year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. We returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter, and this reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We paid down $1.85 billion of commercial paper in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and $30.3 billion of total debt.\nOur leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.2x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 16.6%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company.\nNow I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter that does skew some of the reported segment margins. As I mentioned earlier, we're executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And as we outlined at the beginning of the year, we're referring to our acquired PPD business as our clinical research business. And that resides in laboratory products in Biopharma Services segment.\nSo moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 7% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This is offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business, driven by the moderation in testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 40.3%, down 800 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments we're making across the segment.\nIn the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2 and the organic growth was 13%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume flow-through and productivity that was partially offset by strategic investments.\nTurning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2, reported revenue declined 11% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we saw strong underlying growth in our immunodiagnostics and microbiology businesses, as well as our health care market channel. This is offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. While Q2 adjusted operating income decreased 1% in the quarter, adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. In Q2, the impact of lower testing volume was more than offset by strong productivity enabled by our PPI Business System and positive business mix.\nAnd finally, in Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services segment. Q2 reported revenue increased 55%, organic growth was 10% and the impact of acquisitions was 48%. During Q2, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses.\nPPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well and continues to exceed our expectations. During the quarter, it grew slightly higher than the rest of the segments, contributing $1.72 billion of revenue. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 55% and adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, which is 10 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity and also stole the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix.\nLet me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion. We're also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 9% to 11%. And on the bottom line, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.28 to $22.93. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by 3 elements: a $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business; $500 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue; and a $550 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates.\nLet me provide you some color on each of these elements. So starting with the $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business. This reflects a strong performance in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the core organic outlook for the second half of the year, and that second half raise reflects higher price we put in place to offset higher inflation versus the previous guidance.\nAs I mentioned previously, the increase in core revenue guidance raises the full year outlook for core organic revenue growth from 9% to 11%. This very strong growth performance reflecting excellent commercial execution and strong share gains. In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumptions, the $500 million increase for the year includes the $400 million beat in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the assumption for Q3. This reflects an assumed glide path from Q2 to an endemic run rate level in Q4. There continue to be scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case, we're well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in the first half of the year, we'll flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a derisked approach to the outlook.\nIn terms of FX, we've incorporated current rates into guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $1.25 billion on revenue or 3.2%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 has increased by $0.31 to $0.84 for the full year or 3.3%. The $0.31 change includes a 34% headwind in the second half of the year versus that previous guidance.\nIn terms of profitability, we expect to deliver $110 million more adjusted operating income, up to $700 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull-through in the higher core and testing volume, additional price offsetting inflation and the impact of the headwind from FX.\nWe now expect full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 25.2%. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 from $22.65 to $22.93, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year.\nSo to recap on the guidance change, we continue to execute really well and are able to more than offset the significant FX headwinds, effectively manage inflation and still raise our full year outlook. This demonstrates the power of our proven strategy and our PPI Business System execution.\nLet me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business, is now expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 12% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business, up 1% from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to contribute just over $2 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance.\nOur guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $460 million for the year. We're assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guidance. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion.\nOur guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is a $2 billion of share buybacks to be completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. And we continue to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares.\nAnd finally, I wanted to touch on spacing of the P&L to help you with your modeling. When I think about the revenue dollars in Q3 and Q4, we expect Q4 to contribute just under 52% of the second half total. And looking at adjusted EPS on that same basis, we expect the second half total to be weighted a couple of percentage points more to Q4 than the revenue.\nTo conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for Q&A.",

Casper\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our First Quarter Call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of excellent financial performance. Our core business is performing very well. That strength is broad-based, including PPD, our clinical research business, where the integration is going smoothly, and we're even more excited about the opportunities we have to further enable the success of our pharma and biotech customers. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very pleased with the team's great execution and the share gain we saw across our business. Our continued success is the result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System, which continues to be a differentiator for us. It enables our team to further strengthen our company by finding a better way every day.\nWhen I think about the macro events, much has changed since the start of the year, the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, COVID lockdowns in China. What hasn't changed is our ability to navigate a dynamic landscape and deliver exceptional performance. You'll see that in our first quarter results and outlook for the year.\nSo let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 19% year-over-year to $11.82 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $3.45 billion. Our adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 29.2%, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $7.25 per share. Let me now give you color on the performance by our end markets. Building on the momentum from 2021, we delivered excellent performance to start the year. Our outstanding results this quarter were due to our team's strong execution, good market conditions and share gain. We also had meaningful contribution from COVID-19 testing as we continue to support our customers' needs.\nStarting with pharma and biotech. We had another outstanding quarter of performance, delivering growth in the mid-teens. We saw broad-based strength in this end market as our customers value our trusted partner status. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits during the quarter, with good growth in biosciences, electron microscopy and our research and safety market channel.\nTurning to industrial and applied. We grew in the mid-teens during the quarter. We saw strong growth in all of our analytical instrument businesses. Electron microscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry and chemical analysis as well as in the research and safety market channel. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, Q1 revenue declined in the mid-teens. In the core business, we saw a strong growth in clinical diagnostics, transplant diagnostics and the health care market channel. During the quarter, the team executed really well to support COVID-19 testing needs.\nLet me now provide an update on the progress we made in Q1, executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of 3 elements: a commitment to high-impact innovation, scaling the high-growth and emerging markets and a unique value proposition to our customers. We made great progress in the first quarter, and I'll share just a few of the highlights.\nStarting with the first pillar. It was a fantastic quarter for high-impact innovation as we launched a number of new products that will help our customers break new ground in their important work. A few of the highlights. In our genetic sciences business, we launched our Applied Biosystems SeqStudio Flex Series genetic analyzer to improve clinical research and advanced scientific discovery. In Analytical Instruments, we launched 4 new gas chromatography and GC-MS instruments to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial and pharmaceutical applications. This includes the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series gas chromatograph, which incorporates enhanced automation for instrument health monitoring and offers flexibility for customers to optimize their workflow.\nIn bioproduction, we launched the Gibco CTS Xenon electroporation system for the efficient delivery of genetic material into cells as part of cell therapy manufacturing. In addition, we signed an agreement with precision diagnostic company, Oncocyte, to develop 2 new assays for our Ion Torrent Genexus System to improve cancer tumor profiling and advanced precision medicine. This is just a small sampling of the outstanding innovation going on across our company, enabling our customer success and strengthening our position as the world leader in serving science.\nThe second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We had strong performance in these markets, including China, which grew double digits in the quarter. Our Analytical Instruments business are being used around the world to advance scientific research, including in the high-growth and emerging markets. For example, in Beijing, the National Institute of Biological Sciences is using our mass spectrometers to accelerate their research in structural biology. And in Korea, our electron microscopes are enabling researchers at Pusan National University to establish a bio imaging center to accelerate virus research.\nNow turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, our unique customer value proposition. We continue to enhance our capabilities, so we can be an even stronger partner and industry leader. To help our customers advance cell and gene therapies, we opened a new biorepository in Vacaville, California. This facility will provide specialized biological sample storage and cell therapy logistics. In bioproduction, our network expansion is going well. During the quarter, we brought on additional capacity online for single-use bioprocess containers and cell culture media.\nReflecting our trusted partner status with pharma and biotech customers, we entered a 15-year strategic collaboration agreement with Moderna to establish large-scale U.S. manufacturing of mRNA-based vaccine and therapies. Under this agreement, we'll provide dedicated capacity for a range of aseptic fill/finish services along with inspection, labeling and final packaging.\nDuring the quarter, I had the chance to visit our Greenville, North Carolina campus where we've invested significantly over the past couple of years to expand our capacity and capabilities, and the new building that will support Moderna's pipeline. It's truly impressive.\nNow turning to capital deployment. I'd like to share some of the other steps we've taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Given this was the first full quarter of contribution from PPD, our new clinical research business, I'd like to update you on our progress. The business is performing very well and running ahead of the deal model.\nThe strong start and outlook for the year is allowing us to increase our expectations for the business. Stephen will cover these details in his remarks. In terms of the integration, it's going very smoothly. Our customers are seeing the value of the combination, and we have realized our first commercial synergies, securing new authorizations from pharma and biotech customers who value the combination of our capabilities. This bodes well for our long-term revenue synergies. To further fuel growth and support increasing demand from our biopharma customers, we've also invested to expand our clinical research operations in Richmond, Virginia.\nFinally, I've been super impressed with the team as I've visited different sites. And together, we're taking the business to the next level as part of Thermo Fisher to become an even stronger partner for our customers. As I mentioned on our last call, we closed on PeproTech, a leading provider of bioscience reagents late last year. I'm pleased to note that, that business is off to a great start, and the integration is going incredibly well.\nDuring Q1, we completed a small bolt-on deal in Analytical Instruments to enhance our materials and structural analysis offering for our customers. And during the quarter, we also returned significant capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $2 billion of our shares and increasing our dividend by 15%.\nTurning now to a brief update on our ESG initiatives. We marked a significant milestone during the first quarter, exceeding 1 million readily recyclable paper coolers shipped to transport cold chain products without the use of traditional polystyrene foam coolers. This builds on our commitment to environmental stewardship and enabling broad adoption of sustainable solutions. In addition, we recently announced our partnership with the University of California in San Diego to advance innovation, sustainability and talent development. This 10-year partnership will establish a network of technology centers, focused on accelerating collaborative research and advancing innovations in a range of scientific fields. It will also accelerate educational opportunities, especially for under-resourced students by engaging in joint STEM and community outreach programs and supporting curriculum development, scholarships, fellowships, career mentoring and recruitment.\nBefore covering guidance, I'd like to end my comments with a reflection on the events that are impacting our colleagues, and the world at large. As always, our top priority is the health and safety of our colleagues. We're supporting our colleagues displaced from Ukraine with a variety of needs. And together with our colleagues globally, we've made substantial donations to relief organizations responding in Ukraine and enabling safe haven countries. In China, where many of our colleagues are facing lengthy lockdowns and disruption in daily life due to the pandemic, we're providing care packages to residents in Shanghai who have faced limited food supplies.\nWe also recognize that inflation is challenging for our team, and we're going to provide a special payment this summer to our colleagues.\nNow I'd like to review our 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We are meaningfully raising our full year guidance. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $450 million to $42.45 billion, which would result in 8% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we're raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 to $22.65 per share. This guidance factors in our excellent Q1, includes a very strong core business outlook for the remainder of the year, and it incorporates the expected impact of the recent macroeconomic dynamics.\nOur Q1 results and our increased guide for the year reflects how well the team is navigating in these dynamic times. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. Our outstanding results in Q1 were driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well, and we're gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns, and we're really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. All of this has enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022, and further solidify our incredibly bright future.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we started the year with an excellent Q1. In the quarter, we delivered 16% core organic growth. $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue, $7.25 of adjusted earnings per share and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q1 was just over $1 billion higher than we'd incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $700 million, driven by a very strong start to the year for the core business, and just under $400 million from testing.\nThe strength of the core was broad-based across businesses, end markets and geographies. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on this revenue. And adjusted EPS for Q1 was $0.84 higher than included in our previous guidance. So broad-based beat to start the year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. And as I mentioned, we delivered $7.25 of adjusted EPS in Q1, up 1% versus the prior year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $5.61, down 5% versus the prior year. On the topline, our Q1 reported revenue grew 19% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth and 18% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 2% from foreign exchange. Core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 16%. And as I mentioned, we delivered $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue.\nTurning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q1, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe was flat. Asia Pacific grew in the mid-teens, with China growing in the low double digits, and rest of the world declined in the low single digits.\nWith respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 29.2%, 620 basis points lower than Q1 last year. Adjusted operating margins came in slightly higher than we had anticipated in our prior guidance for Q1, reflecting how well our growth strategy and PPI Business System enables us to manage dynamic times. We executed strong pricing realization, productivity and volume leverage in the core business, enabling us to appropriately address higher inflation, and this was more than offset by the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and the impact of strategic investments, including continued investments in our colleagues.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 47.5%, 660 basis points lower than Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.2% of revenue, a decrease of 20 basis points versus Q1 2021. Total R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q1, representing growth of 14% over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth.\nLooking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $118 million, $5 million higher than Q1 last year, largely due to acquisition financing activities. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.1%. This was 190 basis points lower than Q1 last year, driven by our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were $395 million in Q1, approximately $3 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution.\nTurning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another strong highlight for the quarter. Our PPI business system enabled us to deliver significant cash flow from the very strong topline performance. Cash flow from operating activities in Q1 was $2.2 billion, and free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion. Our capacity and capability investments are progressing well, and this quarter's net capital expenditures were $640 million.\nIn January, we returned $2 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks. Also during the quarter, we increased our dividend by 15%. We ended Q1 with approximately $2.8 billion in cash and $33.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.4x on a net debt basis.\nAnd concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 18%, reflecting the strong returns on investments that we're generating across the company.\nNow I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment, and testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as previously mentioned, we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business, and that resides in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. So moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in this segment increased 1%, and organic revenue was 1% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q1, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. This was offset by lower revenue in the Genetic Sciences business, drive by lower testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 51.4%, down 280 basis points year-over-year.\nIn the quarter, we delivered strong productivity that was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q1, and organic growth was 12%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, up 20 basis points year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity, that was offset by strategic investments we're making across this segment.\nTurning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1, reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue declined 7%. In the quarter, we saw a strong underlying growth in our health care market channel, transplant diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 17% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, down 260 basis points from the prior year.\nIn Q1, we drove strong productivity. This was more than offset by business mix and the strategic investments in the segment. And finally, in Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services segment. In Q1, reported revenue in this segment increased 51%, and organic growth was 6%. During Q1, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel, and the Laboratory Products businesses. PPD, our clinical research business is performing very well. And during the quarter, it grew a few points above the company average core organic growth rate. It contributed $1.66 billion of revenue to the segment in the quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment decreased -- increased 17%, and adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, which is 340 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity, which was more than offset by strategic investments and business mix.\nSo let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. As Marc outlined, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $450 million to $42.45 billion. We're also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 8% to 9% for the year. And on the bottom line, we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 to $22.65 for the year. It's a very strong outlook, particularly as it also factors in the notable macro developments that occurred following our last earnings call in February. Our team continues to do an excellent job navigating through a fluid macroeconomic environment to help us deliver outstanding results, reflecting the strength of our proven growth strategy and the power of the PPI Business System to operate with speed at scale.\nSo let me get into the details of the guidance raise. In terms of revenue, there are 3 elements driving the raise in guidance. $350 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue for the year, a $200 million decrease due to the change in FX rates and a $300 million increase in the outlook for the core business. The core revenue raise incorporates a $350 million headwind from the conflict in Ukraine and the lockdowns in China, and we chose to derisk $600 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in the outlook, offsetting it with other core revenue. Our guidance now assumes $1.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue in total for 2022.\nIncorporating both of these, and still being able to raise the full year outlook for the core shows that the business is performing very well. And as I mentioned previously, we're increasing the core organic growth outlook from 8% to 9% for the year. In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumption, we're continuing the same derisked approach to guidance as there are a range of outcomes for the year. Our guidance now assumes $2.1 billion for testing revenue in 2022, which represents the $1.68 billion delivered in Q1, $225 million in Q2, and then an assumed endemic run rate level of $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case, we're well positioned to support customer needs as we did in Q1, and will flow these benefits through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a derisked approach to the outlook.\nIn terms of profitability, we expect to deliver $90 million more adjusted operating income of the $450 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull-through on the additional revenue, partially offset by $150 million of additional compensation to our colleagues to help them with the temporary impacts of inflation. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22, from $22.43 to $22.65, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year.\nLet me provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance to help you with your models. PPD, our clinical research business, is now expected to deliver $6.7 billion in 2022 in revenue, which represented 11% core organic growth on a full year basis for this business, up 3 percentage points from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to deliver just over $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022, and contribute $1.98 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.08 from our prior guidance. FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $700 million in revenue or 1.8%, and $0.54 from adjusted EPS. We continue to expect net interest expense of approximately $490 million for the year. We now expect an adjusted income tax rate of 13.1% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guide driven by the improved earnings outlook.\nWe continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is the $2 billion of share buybacks that we completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. And we now estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares.\nAnd finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with your modeling. Revenue dollars for the remainder of the year are expected to be fairly linear with Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 and Q3. Core organic growth for Q2 is expected to be lower than Q3 and Q4 due to an estimated 200 basis point impact of lockdowns in China. And in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, we expect Q2, as a percentage of the full year, to be just slightly lower than the comparable period last year.\nTo conclude, we delivered an excellent start to the year, and we're in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.",

Casper\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific.\nWe delivered another quarter of very strong results. And as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System continues to drive outstanding financial performance. Customer demand is strong. Our core business is performing very well. We're gaining market share. And we continue to play a leading role in the societal response to COVID-19. And finally, we continue to build on our trusted partner status with our customers. All of this gives me great confidence in a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders.\nI'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter. Our revenue was $10.7 billion. Adjusted operating income was $3.16 billion, and our adjusted operating margin was 29.5%. Adjusted EPS was $6.54 per share.\nTurning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 22% to $39.21 billion in 2021. Adjusted operating income increased 27% to $12.14 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points to 31%. And we delivered a 28% increase in adjusted EPS to $25.13 per share.\nBuilding on the tremendous success that we had in 2020, I'm incredibly proud of our team's stellar performance in 2021. It's really a testament to the strength of our global team and our proven growth strategy, resulting in another year of exceptional financial results and share gain.\nLet me now give you a color on the results for the quarter and the year, starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance delivering growth over 20% in the fourth quarter and over 25% for the full year. In addition to strong market dynamics, these results were driven by a unique customer value proposition and our leading goal in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.\nDuring the year, we saw broad-based strength across our businesses in this end market, including our bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel.\nIn academic and government, we declined in the low single-digits during in the quarter against strong demand in the year-ago period and grew in the low double digits for the full year.\nDuring the year, we saw very good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly biosciences, electron microscopy and our research and safety market channel.\nTurning to industrial and applied. We grew in the low teens during the quarter, and we grew in the high teens for the full year. During the year, we saw strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel.\nFinally, in diagnostics and health care. Q4 revenue was 30% lower than the prior year quarter, and revenue grew in the high single digits for the full year.\nThroughout the year, the team executed really well to support customers' testing needs. And in the base business, we had strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses.\nBefore I move to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.45 billion in COVID-19 response related revenue. This was driven by the emergence of the Omicron variant, which led to strong testing demand as well as our significant role in enabling vaccine and therapy production. Throughout 2021, we continue to operate with speed at scale to meet our customers' needs related to COVID-19 and generated total response revenue of over $9 billion, of which $2 billion were from vaccines and therapies. I'm very proud of the role that we continue to play around the world to enable our customers and governments to fight the pandemic.\nAt the same time, we're executing our core business strategy incredibly well. Let me provide an update on the progress we made in 2021, executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, as you know: Developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.\nWe made outstanding progress in 2021. Let me share a few of the highlights. Starting with the first pillar. It was a fantastic year of high-impact innovation. In 2021, we launched a number of new products across our businesses, strengthening our industry leadership and enabling our customers to advance their important work.\nIn our bioproduction business, we launched a high-performer DynaDrive Single-Use Bioreactor. Available in sizes up to 5,000 liters, this latest advancement in our DynaDrive single-use bioreactor technology brings the benefits of single-use technologies to unprecedented volumes and performance and ensures consistent scalability from pilot scale studies through commercial production.\nIn chromatography and mass spectrometry, we continue to innovate across life sciences research and biopharmaceutical development. During the year, we extended the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics. And during the fourth quarter, we launched the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris MX, mass detector, providing high-throughput analysis to improve the development and production of biopharmaceutical.\nIn electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL wafer dual beam scanning electron microscope to support the development of increasingly smaller and more complex semiconductors.\nAnd in genetic sciences, our new Applied Biosystems' QuantStudio 7 Pro Dx real-time PCR system, launched in Q4, enables clinical testing laboratories to accelerate molecular diagnostics.\nThe second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets, and I'll highlight a few examples.\nTo increase our capacity for single-use technology, we opened new manufacturing sites in China and Singapore to serve both local and global demand from biopharma customers. In South Korea, we continue to enhance our own capabilities with customer-focused innovation centers for both the semiconductor industry and our biopharma customers. These additional capabilities positions us really well to support our customers' needs.\nThe third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. We've continued to significantly accelerate organic investments in our capabilities and added capacity to be an even better partner for our customers. In 2021, we invested $2.5 billion in capital to meet short- and long-term customer demand. Highlights included expansion of our sterile fill/finish network, bioproduction, enzymes, nucleotide, plasmids and lab products capacity.\nAs always, our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture were major factors in our success during the year. They enable the rapid execution of our capital investments and help us find a better way every day so we can continue to bring innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, and operate with speed at scale to create even greater value for all of our stakeholders.\nTurning to capital deployment. We were very active again this year, which further strengthened our customer value proposition. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders.\nIn 2021, we were very active, investing $24 billion in M&A and completing 10 transactions to further strengthen our customer value proposition. This was highlighted by the addition of PPD, which we closed in December. We're super excited to have our PPD colleagues as part of the company and share their expertise as we work together to enhance innovation and productivity for our pharma and biotech customers.\nPPD is performing at a very high level. The business delivered great results in 2021 and is entering 2022 with outstanding momentum, significantly ahead of our original expectations at the time of the deal announcement. The customer feedback has been extremely positive and we're excited about the pipeline of opportunities that we're building.\nWe're executing our proven integration methodology, which is a key element of our PPI Business System to create value for all of our stakeholders. We're well positioned to deliver year 3 cost synergies of $75 million and $50 million in operating income from revenue synergies. And we're on track to deliver $40 million in cost synergies in 2022.\nAt the end of the year, we completed the acquisition of PeproTech, a leading provider of recombinant proteins, which is an excellent complement to our industry-leading biosciences business. In 2021, we also returned $2.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.\nTurning to a brief update on the progress of our ESG priorities. I'm very proud that over the past year, we significantly advanced our environmental, social and governance initiatives. Our mission: To enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer has never been more relevant.\nHighlights this year include our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our earlier goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% across our operations by 2030. Enhancing the reporting and transparency through our expanded corporate social responsibility report and alignment of multiple ESG reporting frameworks, and we're actively engaging with our community. Our foundation for science reached more than 100,000 students globally through our STEM education programs. Our goal is to make a very positive impact in the communities in which we live and work.\nWith that, I'd like to now review our 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We're significantly raising both our revenue and earnings guidance. This increase is a result of both the strong performance of our core business and an increase in the assumption for COVID-19 testing-related revenue.\nWe're raising our 2022 full year revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, which would result in 7% revenue growth over 2021. And we're increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.07 to $22.43 per share.\nSo to summarize our key takeaways from 2021. We executed very well to continue our growth momentum and deliver outstanding financial performance. Our business is performing very well, and we're gaining market share. Our exceptional performance in 2021 and momentum entering 2022, enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022, and we're incredibly well positioned for the future. Our proven growth strategy positions us to deliver long-term core organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?\n\nStephen Williamson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an excellent quarter, capping off another outstanding year.\nFor the full year 2021, we delivered 17% organic growth that included 14% organic base business growth and $9.2 billion of COVID-19 response revenue. We delivered 28% growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and over $7 billion of free cash flow, all while significantly investing in our company to enable a really bright future. I'm very proud of what the team accomplished this year.\nThese results are significantly ahead of our prior guidance. So let me walk you through the key elements of the beat. We delivered $2.1 billion more revenue than included in our prior guide. This included $1.5 billion higher COVID-19 response revenue, $375 million of revenue from the PPD acquisition and $200 million higher base business revenue.\nOn our last earnings call, we derisked testing response revenue in our guidance. And we said that if for any additional opportunities to support customers' testing needs, we'll be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L, and that's exactly what we did in Q4.\nLet me turn to the base business. In Q4, we delivered 8% base business organic growth, which was 3 percentage points higher than assumed in the prior guide. This is very good performance, particularly given the 4 fewer selling days in the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top line. Our core business is on a great growth trajectory, and we continue to step up and meet our customers' testing needs.\nOur PPI Business System enabled us to generate great pull-through on the very strong revenue performance in Q4, leading to excellent adjusted EPS performance. We delivered $6.54 of adjusted EPS in the quarter and $25.13 for the full year. This was $1.76 ahead of our prior guide. So a broad-based beat to round out an outstanding year.\nLet me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, and as I mentioned, we delivered $6.54 of adjusted EPS in the quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $25.13, up 28% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.17. And for the full year 2021, GAAP EPS was $19.46, up 22% versus the prior year.\nOn the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 1% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 revenue increase included a 4% organic revenue decrease, a 6% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 1% from foreign exchange. And as I mentioned, the base business organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8%.\nFor the full year 2021, reported revenue increased 22%. This includes 17% organic growth, a 3% contribution from acquisitions and a 2% tailwind from foreign exchange. The full year base business organic growth was 14%. And in 2021, we delivered $9.23 billion of COVID-19 response revenue, which includes $2 billion of vaccines and therapy support revenue.\nTurning to our performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior year as well as 4 fewer selling days in Q4 '21 versus the prior year quarter.\nFor Q4, North America declined in the low teens. Europe grew high single digits. Asia Pacific and China grew in the high single digits. And rest of the world grew mid-single digits.\nFor the full year, North America grew low double digits. Europe grew over 25%. Asia Pacific grew over 20%, including just under 20% growth in China. And rest of the world grew mid-teens.\nTurning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, [380] basis points lower than Q4 last year.\nFor the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 31%, which is 130 basis points higher than 2020.\nIn the quarter, our PPI Business System enables to deliver strong volume leverage on the base business, and strong productivity. This was more than offset by the impact of lower testing response revenue and our ongoing strategic investments across our business to support our near- and long-term growth.\nFor the full year, we drove positive volume leverage and productivity. We also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by our strategic investments.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.5%, 340 basis points lower than Q4 [this year]. And for the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.6%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and full year, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin.\nAdjusted SG&A in Q4 was 17.3% of revenue. And for the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.1% of revenue, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to 2020.\nTotal R&D expense was approximately $309 million in Q4. And for the full year, R&D expense was $1.4 billion, representing growth of 19% over the prior year reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth.\nLooking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was [$106 million], $16 million higher than Q4 last year, largely due to the PPD financing activities. Net interest expense for the full year was $493 million, an increase of $5 million from 2020.\nAdjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $7 million, $8 million higher than Q4 2020, mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $38 million, which is $8 million lower than the prior year.\nOur adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.8%. This was 220 basis points lower than Q4 last year, mainly due to the different levels of pretax profitability year-over-year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.6% or 30 basis points higher than 2020.\nAverage diluted shares were 398 million in Q4, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. And for the full year, the average diluted shares was 397 million.\nTurning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. Cash flow from operating activities in 2021 was $9.5 billion, up 15% over the prior year. And free cash flow for the year was $7 billion after investing $2.5 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects strong returns we're generating in the short term and the investments that we'll make for the long term.\nDuring the year, we returned approximately $2.4 million of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. And we ended Q4 with $4.5 billion in cash. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $34.9 billion, up $13.2 billion sequentially from Q3, largely as a result of the financing activities related to the PDD acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.7x gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.3x on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 19.8%, up 180 basis points from Q4 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns.\nSo I'll now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, and let me start with a few framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 response revenue varies by segments that has been consistent throughout the year. We continue to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the response revenue in each segment that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And during Q4, we had 4 fewer selling days than the year-ago quarter. And finally, we recently renamed Laboratory Products segment to reflect the inclusion of the PPD acquisition. It's now Laboratory Products in Biopharma Services segment. And also going forward, we'll refer to PPD as our clinical research business within this segment.\nMoving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q4 reported revenue in the segment decreased 5% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. This was offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by lower testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter.\nFor the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 28% and organic revenue increased 23%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 14%. And adjusted operating margin was 48.2%, down 490 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. And for the full year, adjusted operating income increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 50%, a decrease of 20 basis points versus 2020.\nIn the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 5% in Q4 and organic growth was 6%. Growth in this segment this quarter was driven by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 18% and organic revenue increased 17%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we saw favorable business mix and delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity enabled by our PPI Business System. That was partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 390 basis points versus 2020.\nTurning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q4, reported revenue and organic revenue were both 26% lower than the year-ago quarter. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 6% and organic revenue increased 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 43% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 20.5%, down 590 basis points from the prior year.\nIn Q4, we drove positive productivity enabled by our PPI Business System. This is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, a decrease of 300 basis points versus 2020.\nThen finally, Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. In Q4, reported revenue in this segment increased 16% and organic revenue growth was 5%. During Q4, we saw strong growth in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses. And we recognized $375 million of revenue for PPG to clinical research business. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 21% and organic revenue increased 15%.\nQ4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 42% and adjusted operating margin was 11.5%, which is 210 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity by our PPI Business System and saw a favorable business mix, partially offset by strategic investments. In the full year, adjusted operating income increased 45%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, an increase of 200 basis points versus 2020.\nLet me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. Before I get into the details, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about our definition of core business, which we introduced at our Investor Day last year and notably transitioned to it in 2022. Core includes our base business, the vaccines and therapies response revenue and the PPD acquisition. Given the scale of the PPD acquisition, our core organic growth calculation will include PPD on a full year basis, if we think that gives you the best view of how to look at the total dumpy business and how it's performing. For full transparency, we'll also continue to provide total company organic growth when reporting our actual performance in '22.\nSo moving on to our guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're significantly increasing our full year 2022 revenue and adjusted EPS outlook. We're raising our full year '22 revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, and we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $1.07 to $22.43. This very strong raise reflects the excellent strength of the business. And we continue to expect 8% core organic revenue growth in 2022.\nLet me now provide you with additional details on the updated guidance, starting with revenue, where there are four elements driving the $1.5 billion raise. A $1 billion increase in the COVID-19 testing assumption, a $900 million increase for the core business, a $500 million decrease due to the change in FX rates, and $100 million increase to reflect the PeproTech acquisition, which closed just before the year-end.\nIn terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumption, we're continuing the same derisked approach to guidance under a range of outcomes for the year. Our guidance now assumes $1.75 billion of testing revenue in 2022. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level and should that be the case, we're well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in 2021, we'll flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a derisked approach to the outlook.\nIn terms of the core revenue raise, $600 million relates to PPD and reflects the excellent strength of that business and to a lesser extent, the recent GAAP changes around deferred revenue measurement for acquisitions. We now expect PPD, our new clinical research business, to deliver $6.5 billion in revenue in the full year 2022. This represents 8% organic growth on a full year basis on top of 30% growth it delivered in 2021. And the remaining $300 million of the core revenue raise is to reflect the strong finish to 2021 by the rest of the core business.\nOur core business is in great shape. It ended 2021 with even more scale and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect that it will grow 8% organically in 2022. So a very strong raise overall for our revenue guidance. And we will use our PPI Business System to generate strong pull-through on that revenue. And we now expect adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022, that's a 20 basis points higher than what we assumed in our prior guidance.\nIn terms of adjusted EPS. Our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance from $21.36 to $22.43, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year.\nLet me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance to help you with your models. So I mentioned PPD is expected to deliver $6.5 billion of revenue and $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022. This acquisition is now expected to contribute $1.90 to adjusted EPS in the year. PeproTech is expected to deliver revenue of just over $100 million in 2022 and $0.05 of adjusted EPS. FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $500 million in revenue or 1.3% and $0.31 from adjusted EPS.\nWe continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13% in 2022. We now expect full year net interest cost to be approximately $490 million and other income to be $10 million. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion.\nOur guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks to be already completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We now estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be between 395 million and 396 million shares.\nAnd finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with your modeling. In terms of revenue dollars, the assumption in the guide is the revenue dollars are fairly linear for the year, with Q1 and Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 and Q3. The derisked assumption for COVID-19 testing used in this guidance assumes that this revenue is very front-end loaded in the first half of the year, and then as an assumed endemic run rate level of $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year. Organic growth of the core business is expected to be fairly consistent throughout the year.\nAnd then in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, this guidance assumes slightly more weighting towards the first half of the year than the phasing we had last year, with Q1 being about the same percentage of the full year as we had in 2021.\nTo conclude, we delivered another outstanding year, and we're in great position to achieve our 2022 goals.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.\n\nRafael Tejada\n\nVP of IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, everyone. This is Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our 2025 third quarter review of business results and updated financial outlook. First, a few logistics.\nAs a reminder, today's presentation and associated schedules are available on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nPlease note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2024 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website.\nAdditionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.\nMoving to today's agenda. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss our business performance and growth drivers. I will then review the third quarter sales and P&L results. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then close by sharing an overview of our cash position and capital allocation priorities, followed by additional details on our intended separation of the Orthopaedics business. He will also provide an update on 2025 guidance, key milestones and qualitative considerations for 2026.\nJennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine; John Reed, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine Research and Development; and Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, will be joining us for Q&A.\nTo ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nCEO & Chairman\n\nThank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. We are looking forward to sharing our very strong third quarter results with you. They are a clear sign Johnson & Johnson is in a powerful new era of growth. The success of our portfolio and pipeline is proof that our relentless focus on innovation is doing more than fueling progress. It is accelerating it.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered operational sales growth of 5.4% across our business. In Innovative Medicine, we reported 5.3% operational sales growth and a second consecutive quarter of sales of more than $15 billion. Some were not convinced we could grow through the loss of exclusivity of STELARA, but we were confident and we have now unequivocally answered that question.\nHow did we accomplish that when other companies have failed? In Q3, we did it by delivering double-digit growth across 11 brands, including DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, TALVEY, TECVAYLI, RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE, CAPLYTA, SPRAVATO, SIMPONI, REMICADE, and remarkable growth of 40% in TREMFYA.\nIn MedTech, operational sales growth was even stronger, accelerating to 5.6%, with improvements across all businesses.\nAnd as you have seen from this morning's news, we have announced the planned separation of our Orthopaedics business. This decision further sharpens our focus as a health care innovation leader and accelerates the shift of our MedTech portfolio to areas of greatest unmet need and higher growth. which includes cardiovascular and robotic surgery. I will touch more on this later, but one thing is clear, Johnson & Johnson's momentum is strong and our achievements are multiplying.\nI will now focus on the progress we are making across our 6 priority areas: oncology, immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular, surgery and vision. These are areas where we have deep expertise and clear leadership positions.\nFirst, oncology, where Q3 operational sales grew nearly 20%. You have heard me say before that we are much more than a one-shot company, and our expertise in blood cancers and solid tumors in our oncology portfolio is a great example. Take multiple myeloma, where our competitiveness is unrivaled. No other company has the expertise or success in multiple myeloma than we do. We have treatments in every line of therapy, and DARZALEX is the gold standard with more than 50% market share across all lines of therapy.\nQ3 operational sales of DARZALEX grew by 20%, and its potential continues to build with the approval this quarter in Europe as a treatment for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, as well as promising new studies of DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with TECVAYLI.\nI also want to say a word about CARVYKTI, our CAR-T treatment for multiple myeloma. We have now treated more than 8,500 patients globally, making CARVYKTI the most successful CAR-T launch ever. With operational sales growing by more than 80% this quarter, we are increasingly confident in CARVYKTI's $5 billion peak year sales potential.\nTurning to solid tumors. We were thrilled to receive FDA approval for our bladder cancer treatment, INLEXZO, last month. INLEXZO highlights what is unique about Johnson & Johnson. Building on our unmatched capabilities in both Innovative Medicine and MedTech, it is the first and only drug-releasing system to provide sustained local delivery of a cancer treatment directly into the bladder. It is transformative for patients and it is transformative for doctors.\nIt will also contribute significantly to future growth with a targeted release platform projected to be another blockbuster treatment with at least $5 billion in annual peak year sales. Sourced through an early stage deal, INLEXZO is also an example of our outstanding business development model. In fact, in the last 18 months alone, we have completed more than 60 deals of this kind.\nAnd in lung cancer, we recently published results in the New England Journal of Medicine for RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE, showing a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death compared to osimertinib. We are now seeing the potential for patients to live significantly longer than anyone thought possible. The combination of RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE is another of our $5 billion peak year sales assets.\nNext, I want to talk about immunology, where we have been leaders for 25 years. From REMICADE to SIMPONI and STELARA to TREMFYA, some of our biggest blockbusters have come from our immunology portfolio. We have long talked about TREMFYA as the next big innovation to follow the success of STELARA. Based on this quarter's performance, it looks like it could be both bigger and better, having delivered operational sales growth of 40% driven by new indications in inflammatory bowel disease.\nTREMFYA is the only IL-23 inhibitor to offer a fully subcutaneous regimen across ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Even prior to the launch of our subcutaneous formulation, TREMFYA was capturing approximately half of all new patient starts for IL-23 ulcerative colitis treatments in the U.S., which we achieved within 1 year from launch. We are confident TREMFYA will become a more than $10 billion asset. And in typical J&J fashion, we are deep in development of our next immunology innovation, icotrokinra, initially for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Historically, the most effective immunology treatments have been injectables. As the first oral peptide to selectively block the IL-23 receptor icotrokinra has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of plaque psoriasis with a once-a-day pill. We submitted icotrokinra for plaque psoriasis to the FDA in July. And you know this is just the beginning as we have already presented data from our Phase II trials in ulcerative colitis.\nLet's now turn to neuroscience with SPRAVATO operational sales growing an impressive 61% in Q3. SPRAVATO remains the only approved stand-alone therapy for treatment-resistant depression, a major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation. Through Q3, we have now treated more than 180,000 patients, and I could not be prouder of the impact this team is having.\nOur leadership in neuropsychiatry was also strengthened by this year's acquisition of Intracellular Therapies with FDA approval for CAPLYTA in major depressive disorder anticipated soon. CAPLYTA is already FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia as well as depressive episodes associated with Bipolar Disorder 1 and 2. We project CAPLYTA to reach $5 billion annually.\nNow let's turn to MedTech, starting with our cardiovascular portfolio. In Q3, cardiovascular operational sales increased by approximately 12%, as we fortify our leadership in the fastest-growing cardiovascular intervention segment. With operational sales growth of over 20%, Shockwave's unique intravascular lithotripsy technology is helping treat more atherosclerotic cardiovascular patients than ever before. In fact, in the last quarter, Shockwave supported their 1 millionth patient. And with the recent European approval of the Javelin peripheral intravascular lithotripsy catheter, we expect strong momentum moving forward. We anticipate Shockwave becoming our 13th billion MedTech platform by year-end.\nIn electrophysiology, we are industry leaders. And with the strength of our [indiscernible] technology, that continues. In Q3, we again delivered close to 10% operational sales growth, and our position will further strengthen with real-world data showing VARIPULSE achieved 99.7% acute effectiveness in nearly 800 patients, with strong safety and no incidence of stroke.\nOur Abiomed business also continues to perform strongly with more than 15% operational sales growth in the quarter. Our success reflects the impact that our Impella CP heart pump is having on the lives of patients, which you could see in the long-term survival data that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine this quarter. In the 10-year DanGer Shock study, routine use of Impella CP in patients who have had a heart attack with cardiogenic shock reduced mortality by 16.3% compared to the standard of care, with patients gaining an average of 600 additional days alive. It is a perfect example of what we mean when we say Johnson & Johnson is delivering groundbreaking innovation.\nIn surgery, we are making progress on multiple fronts. Our surgical technologies are used in most operating rooms globally. And in Q3, we delivered more than 9% growth in biosurgery and almost 7% in wound closure, driven by accelerating adoption of our latest innovations. We also continue to make positive progress with OTTAVA as we anticipate FDA de novo submission in early 2026.\nAnd now to vision, where we grew more than 6% last quarter. Our [ Technis ] intraocular lenses are the fastest growing in the markets where we have launched, fueling our 13.8% operational sales growth in surgical vision. And after launching the world's first multifocal contact lens for people with astigmatism in the U.S. last quarter, we brought this latest member of the ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day family to Europe and Korea in Q3, further strengthening our momentum.\nAnd finally, to this morning's Orthopaedics news. As you know, the health care industry continues to evolve rapidly and we are constantly evaluating our overall business and portfolio to ensure Johnson & Johnson remains best positioned to truly lead where health care is going. We continue to invest at industry-leading levels in our pipeline and portfolio while making disciplined decisions to exit businesses that we believe will be better able to thrive outside of Johnson & Johnson.\nFor our Orthopaedics business, the planned separation creates new opportunities. Operating as DePuy Synthes and led by Namal Nawana, it would be the largest most comprehensive orthopedic company with leading market share positions across major categories and addressing a more than $50 billion and growing market opportunity. We expect DePuy Synthes to benefit from a more focused business model with greater flexibility to extend its market leadership, invest in its commercial capabilities and capitalize on profitable growth opportunities.\nFollowing the completion of the planned separation, Johnson & Johnson will retain a leadership position in our 6 core growth areas across Innovative Medicine and MedTech, oncology, immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular surgery and vision, and be able to place even greater focus in our investment towards higher growth areas where we can meaningfully extend and improve lives. We are positioning each business to win and deliver for our stakeholders. As we move forward in the separation process, we will provide additional information as appropriate, and Joe will share more details shortly.\nAs I said at the start of the call, we are in a new era of accelerated growth at Johnson & Johnson. This is more than just another strong quarter. It is proof that our momentum is building and that our impact is accelerating.\nThank you very much, and I will now turn the call back over to Darren.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.\nStarting with Q3 2025 sales results. Worldwide sales were $24 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 5.4% despite an approximate 640 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in the U.S. was 6.2% and 4.4% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact on worldwide growth of 100 basis points, primarily driven by the Intracellular acquisition.\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.2 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $2.12 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.11 a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion, with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.80, both representing an increase of 15.7% compared to the third quarter of 2024. As a reminder, results in the third quarter of 2024 were impacted by the acquired IP R&D expense of $1.25 billion associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody.\nI will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter, focusing on the 6 key areas where meaningful innovation is driving our performance and fueling long-term growth. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, where our results demonstrate the depth of our expertise across oncology, immunology and neuroscience.\nWorldwide sales of $15.6 billion increased 5.3% despite an approximate 1,070 basis point headwind from STELARA, illustrating the continued strength of our key brands and new launches. Growth in the U.S. was 6% and 4.3% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 160 basis points on worldwide growth due to the Intracellular acquisition.\nIn oncology, starting with multiple myeloma, DARZALEX growth was 19.9%, primarily driven by continued strong share gains of approximately 5.7 points across all lines of therapy, with nearly 9 points in the frontline setting as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $524 million, with growth of 81.4% driven by share gains and slight expansion. This reflects continued strong sequential growth of 18.5% as our expansion outside the U.S. progresses.\nTECVAYLI and TALVEY growth was 29.9% and 59.1%, respectively, bolstered by continued expansion into the community setting.\nIn prostate cancer, [ Alida ] delivered strong growth of 15.3% due to market growth and continued share gains, partially offset by the impact of Part D redesign.\nIn lung cancer, RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE delivered sales of $198 million and growth over 100%, driven by continued strong launch uptake. We continue to see share gains in both first and second lines of therapy.\nWithin immunology, TREMFYA delivered very strong growth of 40.1%. We continue to see share gains across all indications, with particularly robust momentum from our IBD launch. STELARA declined by 42%, driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign, which is in line with our expectations.\nIn neuroscience, SPRAVATO grew an impressive 60.8%, driven by continued strong demand from physicians and patients. CAPLYTA, which was acquired in Q2 as part of the Intracellular acquisition, delivered sales of $240 million and reflects healthy sequential growth of 13.4%.\nNow moving to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8.4 billion increased 5.6%, with growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and 4.5% outside the U.S., driven by strong performance in our 3 focus areas: cardiovascular, surgery and vision. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 10 basis points on worldwide growth.\nIn cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 9.7% versus prior year, driven by procedure growth, commercial execution, VARIPULSE and other new products and strength in competitive mapping. Abiomed delivered growth of 15.6% with continued strong adoption of Impella technology. And Shockwave increased 20.9% driven by double-digit growth globally in both coronary and peripheral.\nSurgery grew 3.3% despite divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 50 basis points. Performance was primarily driven by technology penetration in wound closure, the strength of the portfolio and commercial execution in biosurgery, as well as a onetime reserve adjustment in the quarter. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and the negative impact of China [ VBP ] across the portfolio.\nIn vision, contact lenses and other products grew 3.5%, driven by market growth, strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of contact lenses. This includes the recent launches of OASYS Max 1-Day multifocal for astigmatism and MAX 1-Day for astigmatism, as well as continued strategic price actions.\nSurgical vision had another strong quarter with growth of 13.8%, driven by new product innovations such as [ Technis Pure C ], Odyssey and [ Eyehance ], robust demand and strong commercial execution. These results further solidify our leadership positions in vision.\nAs Joaquin noted, we have today announced our intent to separate the orthopedic business. Orthopedic growth this quarter is gaining momentum and increased to 2.4%. Importantly, hips and knees returned to growth this quarter, delivering 5.1% and 5.6% growth, respectively.\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2025. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter a year ago. Cost of products sold leveraged by 60 basis points driven by a reduction in amortization expense and favorable currency in the Innovative Medicine business, as well as the nonrecurring fair value inventory step-up related to Shockwave in 2024. This was partially offset by unfavorable product mix in Innovative Medicine along with MedTech macroeconomic factors.\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses deleveraged by 40 basis points driven by increased investment in the recent Intracellular acquisition for CAPLYTA and promotional spend across the Innovative Medicine business, partially offset by expense leveraging in MedTech.\nResearch and development expenses leveraged by 670 basis points primarily driven by the expense of $1.25 billion to secure the global rights to the NM26 bispecific antibody recorded in 2024. We continued our strong investment in research and development with $3.7 billion or approximately 15% of sales in Q3.\nInterest income and expense was a net expense of $18 million, as compared to $99 million of income in the third quarter of 2024, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and a lower average cash balance. Other income and expense was net income of $0.5 billion, compared to an expense of $1.8 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by a talc litigation charge in 2024 and higher gains on the sales of securities in 2025, partially offset by the monetization of royalty rights recorded in 2024.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 31.2%, compared to 19.3% in the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by the onetime $1 billion remeasurement of deferred tax balances, which are required to reflect the changes in statutory tax rates associated with the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the third quarter. More information can be found in the company's Form 10-Q.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided the company's income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.\nNow let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. Innovative Medicine margin improved from 37.9% to 44.3%, primarily driven by the onetime expense of $1.25 billion to secure the global rights of the NM26 bispecific antibody recorded in 2024, partially offset by increased investment in commercial spend in 2025 and the nonrecurring monetization of royalty rights in 2024.\nMedTech margin declined from 24.1% to 21%, driven by macroeconomic factors and cost of products sold, partially offset by expense leveraging in [ SM&A ].\nThis concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call, and I will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Darren. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we sustained momentum across our end market portfolio, delivering upon the heightened financial expectations we guided to last quarter.\nIn Innovative Medicine, we continued to grow through the STELARA loss of exclusivity as we said we would. The progression of our pipeline evidenced by significant regulatory milestones adds further depth to our 3 focus areas of oncology, immunology and neuroscience. We are well positioned for the balance of the decade.\nIn MedTech, we improved adjusted operational sales across key areas of the business. As Joaquin mentioned, we are sharpening our focus on high-growth, high-margin markets where we can improve patient outcomes as this morning's announcement regarding the DePuy Synthes business indicates. In a moment, I will build upon Joaquin's comments regarding that announcement.\nThe foundation we have set combined with the progression of our pipeline strongly position the company for accelerated growth. It also reinforces our conviction to deliver on the upper end of our long-term growth targets.\nLet me provide a brief update on the Daubert motions pending in the talc litigation. As you are aware, this is the judicial process by which the court will reexamine the junk science that the mass tort plaintiffs [indiscernible] to fuel baseless claims against Johnson & Johnson as well as many American businesses. We look forward to and expect to secure favorable rulings on the Daubert motions, which should be rendered by the first quarter of 2026.\nNow turning to cash and capital allocation. We generated $14 billion in free cash flow through the first 9 months of the year. We ended the third quarter with approximately $19 billion in cash and marketable securities and $46 billion of debt, for a net debt position of $27 billion versus the $32 billion of net debt reported in the second quarter. We continue to utilize our free cash flow generation and strong balance sheet to invest in innovation and return capital directly to shareholders.\nWe are often asked about our appetite for acquisitions to meet financial targets. I can be very clear on this. We rely on our thoughtful long-term approach to growing through any loss of exclusivity and won't carelessly deploy capital on speculative transactions out of desperation. Our current portfolio and pipeline have momentum. And with the STELARA loss of exclusivity increasingly in the rearview mirror, we do not need to rely on large transactions to drive our growth. We intend to remain disciplined, opportunistically pursuing strategic high-value opportunities that utilize our expertise and capabilities that deliver an appropriate return for the risk that we bear on behalf of shareholders.\nRegarding the planned separation of our Orthopaedics business, As Joaquin noted, the separation is expected to enhance the strategic and operational focus of each company and drive value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Given that we are early in the process, there are limited details available, but we are committed to providing you with information on a timely basis. While we will, of course, communicate material developments, we don't expect to have anything newsworthy to convey until mid-next year.\nBut what can we say at this moment? First, the separation will further strengthen our overall MedTech business and increased Johnson & Johnson's top line growth and margins. To give that some directional context, if we just look at normalized year-to-date 2025 results, MedTech's top line revenue growth and operating margin would both improve by at least 75 basis points.\nNext, we are targeting completion of the separation within 18 to 24 months, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Given it is the most resource-intensive and likely longest duration, we are prioritizing and have begun the separation assuming a spin-off, with the intention for that to qualify as a tax-free separation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, we will consider other avenues that optimize shareholder value.\nWe do not expect any change to the Johnson & Johnson dividend and are mindful of any impact from stranded costs that are typically present in these types of transactions.\nFinally, following the separation, we would expect DePuy Synthes to have a strong capital structure that would allow the Orthopaedics business to build on its long history of innovation and extend leadership positions through enhanced organic investment and strategic growth accretive M&A.\nAs we pursue the separation, the Orthopaedics unit will operate in alignment with the business' current strategy, continuing to make investments in growth, margin improvement and innovation.\nTurning now to full year guidance for 2025. We are increasing operational sales guidance for the full year by approximately $300 million, resulting in operational sales growth for the full year in the range of 4.8% and to 5.3% with a midpoint of $93 billion or 5.1%.\nExcluding the impact from acquisitions and [ mergers], our adjusted operational sales growth is now expected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.0% compared to 2024. As a reminder, we started the year guiding to a midpoint for 2.5% for adjusted operational sales.\nAs you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements and last quarter, we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of $1.17. The U.S. dollar has stayed relatively flat to the euro spot rate, and as a result, we now expect reported sales growth between 5.4% to 5.9%, with a midpoint of $93.7 billion or 5.7%.\nTurning to other notable items on the P&L. We are reiterating our operating margin guide of an approximate 300 basis point improvement for the full year, assuming what we know today as it relates to tariffs. For net interest expense, we are now projecting between $0 and $50 million, an improvement from the previous guidance, primarily driven by higher cash balances.\nWe are expecting a higher effective tax rate to be in the range of 17.5% to 18% for the full year, with the increase largely due to the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\nWe feel strongly that U.S. tax policy has enabled Johnson & Johnson to increase our manufacturing footprint in the U.S. We have more manufacturing facilities in the United States than in any other country, and we remain committed to investing $55 billion in U.S.-based innovation and manufacturing over the next 4 years. In March, we broke ground at our Wilson, North Carolina facility. And in August, we announced a $2 billion commitment to further increase our presence in North Carolina with a more than 160,000 square foot dedicated manufacturing facility at FujiFilm's new biopharmaceutical manufacturing site in Holly Springs. Our overall U.S. investment plans also include 3 additional new advanced manufacturing facilities as well as the expansion of several existing sites.\nTurning to earnings per share. You may recall we started the year guiding to adjusted EPS of $10.60. Today we stand much higher even after including dilution of $0.25 from the Intracellular acquisition. Today we are reaffirming our elevated July earnings per share outlook, which also absorbs a higher annual effective tax rate and fourth quarter investments that will further position the business for long-term success. As such, our expected adjusted earnings per share guidance remains $10.85 or 8.7% at the midpoint, with a range of $10.80 to $10.90. Our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance is $10.68 or 7% at the midpoint.\nLooking beyond our financial commitments for the year, we are on track to add to the already impressive number of milestones that we achieved across our pipeline in 2025. In Innovative Medicine, we anticipate U.S. FDA approval for subcutaneous RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer as well as for CAPLYTA in adjunctive major depressive disorder. We recently filed for a label expansion on TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis and plan to present data for RYBREVANT in head and neck cancer at ESMO in the coming week.\nIn MedTech, we continue to make progress with our clinical trial for our OTTAVA robotic surgical system. In our cardiovascular portfolio, we are planning regulatory submissions for the dual-energy [ Thermocool SmartTouch ] SF catheter for cardiac arrhythmia in the U.S. And in vision, we will continue to roll out ACUVUE OASYS MAX for astigmatism.\nAs we are close to year-end and with a strong caveat that we are still finalizing plans for next year and macro factors can change quickly, let me provide some preliminary thoughts to inform your modeling for 2026. For Innovative Medicine, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver accelerated growth despite STELARA loss of exclusivity. This will be driven by our in-market brands and continued progress from our recently launched products, including TREMFYA in inflammatory bowel disease, RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in non-small cell lung cancer and INLEXZO in bladder cancer. We currently anticipate a 2026 approval for icotrokinra in psoriasis.\nIn MedTech, we continue to expect accelerated growth off this year's levels driven by focus on higher growth markets as well as the continued adoption of newer products across all MedTech platforms. We also anticipate the launch of Shockwave's [ C2 Aero ] coronary IVL catheter, the [ Tecnis Pure C ] intraocular lens in the U.S. as well as regulatory submission for the OTTAVA robotic surgical system.\nAgain, while early, I like the way 2026 is shaping up. In fact, based on my last look at your 2026 models, it appears the current revenue consensus of 4.6% growth in your models for 2026 is lower than we project, which we believe, in total, will exceed 5%. Similarly, with the expectation that adjusted earnings per share is commensurate with sales growth, there appears to be some upside to the current adjusted earnings per share consensus of $11.39, perhaps as much as $0.05. This commentary considers investments we will be making behind many of the new product launches I just highlighted, but you can also expect some margin improvement. It also reflects our understanding of the present legislative landscape tariffs, foreign exchange rates and procedural volumes. We look forward to sharing further details regarding our official guide for 2026 during our Q4 earnings call in January.\nIn summary, the strength of our business model with a focus on where we can have the greatest impact for patients will enable Johnson & Johnson to deliver against our strategic objectives and financial commitments. We are as confident as we have been in recent memory about the future.\nI'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues around the world for their continued hard work and steadfast dedication that serve our patients and who make these financial results possible and sustainable.\nWith that, we are happy to take your questions. Kevin, will you please open the call for Q&A.?",

I am excited to be here today and to lead the investor relations team moving forward. Welcome to our 2025 second quarter review of business results and updated financial outlook. First, a few logistics. As a reminder, today's presentation and associated schedules are available on the investor relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2024 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss our business performance and key catalysts. I will then review the second quarter sales and P&L results. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then close by sharing an overview of our cash position and guidance update for 2025. Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, John Reed, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine Research and Development, and Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, will be joining us for Q&A.\nTo ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to talk about our very strong second quarter. Today's results showcase the strength of our uniquely diversified business as the only major healthcare company operating in both the MedTech and innovative medicine sectors. In the second quarter, we delivered operational sales growth of 4.6% across our business. In innovative medicine, we reported 3.8% operational sales growth, delivering more than $15 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. No other healthcare company has grown through the loss of exclusivity of a multi-billion dollar product in the first year. In our case, Stelara, and yet that is exactly what we are doing for the second quarter in a row. Our performance was driven by double-digit growth across 13 brands, including Darzalex, Carvykti, Tecvayli, and Talvey, as well as Rybrevant, Lazcluze, Tremfya, Carvykti, and Spravato.\nIn MedTech, we delivered 6.1% operational sales growth with particularly strong momentum in cardiovascular surgery and vision. Based on our strong performance in the quarter, we are pleased to raise our full-year sales guidance by $2 billion and EPS guidance by $0.25 from $10.60 to $10.85. Results like these are a direct result of our deep and resilient portfolio. It's what makes Johnson & Johnson unique. Today, we'll focus on the remarkable ways we are driving innovation and creating value for patients and shareholders. We'll highlight the depth of our portfolio and pipeline, focusing on six areas of unmet need and where we are delivering significant growth: oncology, immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular, surgery, and vision. These are spaces where we are moving the conversation from treatment to cure and where we are extending and improving lives in meaningful ways.\nLet's start with innovative medicine and oncology, where we have a bold vision to eliminate cancer. Our leading products for the treatment of blood cancers and solid tumors are built on cutting-edge scientific platforms that are transforming outcomes for patients. With more than 10 products in market across 26 approved indications, and over 25 treatments in late-stage development, we expect to become the number one oncology company by 2030 with sales of more than $50 billion. When you look at our quarterly results in oncology, with operational sales growth of 22.3%, you can see that we are well on our way to achieving that. I'll draw your attention to three key areas of Q2 progress. First is multiple myeloma, where we have treatments in every line of therapy. Approximately 80% of myeloma patients today receive a Johnson & Johnson medicine at some point in their treatment journey.\nIn Q2, we presented several important sets of data. They include new five-year data showing a single treatment of our CAR-T therapy, CARVYKTI, has the potential to deliver long-term remission. We also presented the first data from our investigational tri-specific antibody, which showed an unprecedented 100% overall response rate in heavily pretreated patients. With results like these, we are closer than ever to our ambition of curing multiple myeloma. Second is lung cancer, where our chemotherapy-free combination of RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE has a projected overall survival of at least a year over the current standard of care in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR gene mutations. Intent to prescribe continues to grow among healthcare professionals, which you can see in our strong quarterly sales. This is a life-changing advancement for patients and one we are building on with a pipeline of novel therapies.\nAnd third is bladder cancer, where we are excited to share that we have received FDA priority review for TAR-200, a first-of-its-kind drug-releasing system. We anticipate launching TAR-200 for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer later this year, a transformational product that harnesses our unique expertise in both innovative medicine and MedTech. We expect TAR-200 to generate at least $5 billion in annual peak year sales. In immunology, we have a 25-year legacy of redefining the standard of care, and we are just getting started. With six products in market across 14 approved indications and many treatments in late-stage development, we are expanding treatment options for patients and restoring health for millions of people around the world. From Remicade and Simponi to Stelara and Tremfya, and now exploring targeted oral peptides and future combinations, the growth potential of our immunology portfolio and pipeline continues to be significant.\nFor immunology, I will draw your attention to two key areas of Q2 progress. First is Tremfya, which has recently expanded into inflammatory bowel disease. Tremfya grew 30% in the quarter. With strong uptake in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, we expect it to generate at least $10 billion annually in peak year sales. We also made important progress in our pipeline in Q2 and expect to file Icotrokinra with the FDA in the third quarter as the first targeted oral peptide to selectively block the IL-23 receptor with similar efficacy to a biologic. As a once-a-day pill, this molecule has the potential to set a new standard in the treatment of plaque psoriasis, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months. In neuroscience, we are building on a 70-year legacy and expect to be the number one company by the end of the decade.\nWe are pushing boundaries in diseases like schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer's, which together affect one in eight people worldwide. In Q2, Spravato grew 53%, delivering sustained double-digit growth and demonstrating the power of this medicine for patients living with difficult-to-treat depression. We also completed the acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies this quarter. Intra-Cellular Caplyta is approved to treat adults with schizophrenia and bipolar depression, and we are excited about the anticipated major depressive disorder approval later this year. With the addition of Caplyta, we now have five neuroscience products in market across six approved indications and eight treatments in late-stage development. Caplyta adds to Johnson & Johnson's robust lineup of therapies with $5 billion-plus potential in peak year sales and further solidifies sales growth above analyst expectations through the rest of the decade. Turning to MedTech and in cardiovascular specifically, we are leaders in heart recovery, circulatory restoration, and electrophysiology.\nCardiovascular has some of the largest unmet needs in healthcare and is one of the fastest-growing spaces in MedTech. In Q2, we delivered over 22% operational sales growth over the quarter, driven by new product performance in Abiomed, Shockwave, and strength in mapping in electrophysiology. Today, we're a leader in four of the largest and highest-growth MedTech segments within cardiovascular intervention, impacting more than one million patients each year. Now, let me highlight three areas of important progress from Q2. First is electrophysiology, which delivered close to 10% operational sales growth over the quarter, driven by new product performance and strength in mapping. We have now completed more than 10,000 Varipulse cases globally, with a reported neurovascular event rate of less than 0.5%, consistent with published rates across other PFA platforms.\nSecond, we continue to advance a suite of cardiovascular solutions to expand our market leadership, including our THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF catheter, where we performed our first cases in Europe this quarter. It also includes OMNIPULSE, where we presented strong early data that will expand our portfolio of tools for safe and streamlined ablation procedures. Third is Shockwave's unique intravascular lithotripsy technology, or IVL, which has transformed the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is driving significant growth. Shockwave is expected to be our $13 billion MedTech platform by the end of the year, a position that is further strengthened by a compelling body of evidence on the benefits of this technology. This includes data showing an IVL-first approach can achieve excellent outcomes in female patients with complex calcified coronary artery disease.\nIn surgery, we have spent 140 years advancing the standard of care, and today, our surgical technologies are used in most operating rooms around the world. Q2 highlights include the introduction of the ECHELON 4000 surgical stapler, the newest advancement in our surgical portfolio. Featuring advanced stapling technology and reloads, the ECHELON 4000 minimizes surgical leaks and bleeding, which are common and costly surgical complications for patients and hospitals. This advanced stapling technology will be harnessed for future use exclusively on the OTTAVA robotic surgery system. As mentioned on our earnings call in April, OTTAVA completed its first clinical cases, gastric bypass surgeries performed in Houston.\nIn our conversations with surgeons who have spent time on OTTAVA, they tell us that they are eager for the system's sophisticated architecture, design features like twin motion, the surgeon-entrusted Ethicon advanced instrumentation only available in OTTAVA, and the future connection to our open digital ecosystem, Polyphonic. We plan to submit for an FDA de novo approval next year. And finally, vision, where we have a deep legacy in developing transformational innovation. With quarterly growth of 4.6% across the business and 8.9% in surgical vision, the portfolio has a robust growth trajectory driven by our Acuvue Oasys Max 1-Day family of contact lenses and our Tecnis Odyssey and Tecnis PureSee intraocular lenses. And with the Q2 release of the first disposable multifocal lenses for people with astigmatism, we have high expectations.\nYou know, few other healthcare companies can talk about their impact across as many high-growth areas as Johnson & Johnson, and none spanning both innovative medicine and MedTech. These six examples are only a cross-section of our cutting-edge portfolio. This depth and breadth is who we are at Johnson & Johnson. It's how we grow through a major loss of exclusivity, how we have reinvented ourselves time and time again, and how we will deliver strong financial performance through the end of the decade and beyond. The bottom line is this: Johnson & Johnson's relentless focus on innovation yields results, quarter after quarter, year after year. I will now turn the call back over to Darren Snellgrove.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q2 2025 sales results. Worldwide sales were $23.7 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 4.6% despite an approximate 710 basis points headwind from Stelara. Growth in the U.S. was 7.8% and 0.6% outside of the U.S.. Worldwide growth was positively impacted by 160 basis points, primarily due to the intracellular and shockwave acquisitions. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.5 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $2.29 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.93 a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.7 billion, with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.77, representing a decrease of 2.1% and 1.8% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2024.\nThe decrease is driven by interest associated with incremental debt from the Intra-Cellular acquisition and GP erosion from Stelara. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter, with a focus on the six areas Joaquin discussed that will drive significant growth for the enterprise. Beginning with innovative medicine, where our results demonstrate the depth of our expertise in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. Worldwide sales of $15.2 billion increased 3.8% despite an approximate 1,170 basis points headwind from Stelara, demonstrating the strength of our key brands and new launches. Growth in the U.S. was 7.6% and -1.6% outside the U.S.. Growth outside of the U.S. was negatively impacted by Stelara biosimilars and the COVID-19 vaccine. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 140 basis points on worldwide growth due to the Intra-Cellular acquisition.\nIn oncology, starting with myeloma, Darzalex growth was 21.5%, primarily driven by continued strong share gains of approximately 4.1 points across all lines of therapy, with close to 8 points in the frontline setting, as well as market growth. Carvykti achieved sales of $439 million, with growth of over 100%, driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects continued strong sequential growth of 17.9% as we expand outside of the U.S.. Tecvayli and Talvey growth was 22.4% and 54.3% respectively, bolstered by continued expansion into the community setting. Patient demand remains strong despite continued adoption of longer dosing intervals. In prostate cancer, Erleada delivered strong growth of 21%, with continued share gains and market growth. In lung cancer, Rybrevant plus Lazcluze delivered sales of $179 million and growth over 100%, with sequential growth of 26.5% driven by continued strong launch uptake.\nWe continue to see share gains in both first and second lines of therapy. Within immunology, Tremfya delivered growth of 30.1%, primarily driven by share gains, with continued strong uptake across recently launched IBD indications and overall market growth. Stelara declined by 43.2%, driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign, which is in line with our expectations. In neuroscience, Spravato growth of 53% was driven by continued strong demand from physicians and patients. Long-acting injectables declined by 6.3% due to the impact of Part D redesign and unfavorable patient mix. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8.5 billion increased 6.1%, with growth of 8% in the U.S. and 4.1% outside the U.S., driven by strong performance in three focus areas: cardiovascular, surgery, and vision.\nAcquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 200 basis points on worldwide growth, primarily due to Shockwave. In cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 9.8% versus prior year, driven by strength in competitive mapping, new product performance, and procedure growth. Abiomed delivered growth of 16.9%, with continued strong adoption of Impella technology, and Shockwave delivered strong double-digit growth with the recent introduction of the Javelin and E8 catheters. As a reminder, the acquisition benefit of Shockwave was lapped at the end of May. Surgery grew 1.8% despite divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 60 basis points. Performance was primarily driven by technology penetration and wound closure, and the strength of the portfolio and biosurgery. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and the negative impact of China VBP across the portfolio.\nIn Vision, contact lenses and other ocular products grew 2.9%, driven by strategic price actions and strong performance in the Acuvue Oasys 1-Day family of contact lenses, including the recent launch of Oasys Max 1-Day multifocal for astigmatism. Surgical Vision growth of 8.9% continues to be driven by strong performance in Tecnis Odyssey, PureSee, and Eyhance. The orthopedics business declined by 1.6%, driven by competitive pressures, the transformation program, and China VBP. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2025, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter a year ago. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 150 basis points, driven by product mix and amortization related to the Intra-Cellular acquisition in Innovative Medicine, as well as MedTech macroeconomic factors and VBP in China.\nSelling, marketing, and administrative expenses improved 50 basis points, driven by corporate expense rationalization, partially offset by increased investment in recent acquisitions. Research and development expenses leveraged by 50 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio rationalization and expense phasing in MedTech. We continued our strong investment in research and development with $3.5 billion, or approximately 15% of sales in Q2. Interest income and expense was a net expense of $48 million as compared to $125 million of income in the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance associated with the Intra-Cellular acquisition.\nOther income and expense was a net expense of $0.1 billion compared to an expense of $0.7 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by lower talc litigation expense in 2025 and the $0.4 billion loss on the sale of the retained stake in Kenvue shares recorded in 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.7% compared to 18.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 10-Q for details on the changes in taxes. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided the company's income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter.\nIn support of our efforts to increase financial transparency, you will again find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations by segment in the supplemental schedules of our press release. Innovative Medicine margin declined from 44.6% to 42.7%, primarily driven by negative mix in cost of product sold related to Stelara. MedTech margin declined from 25.7% to 22.2%, driven by macroeconomic factors in cost of product sold as well as other income. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call, and I will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Darren, and glad to see your first earnings call is off to a good start. I look forward to you leveraging your recent experience leading the innovative medicine finance team to benefit Johnson & Johnson's investor relations function. Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today. As already highlighted, we delivered a very strong second quarter, exceeding expectations on both the top and bottom line. While our currently marketed products and platforms drove this quarter's performance, the progress across our pipeline in the first half of the year heightens our conviction to achieve and, I'd be willing to bet, likely beat the upper end of the growth targets we conveyed at our 2023 enterprise business review. As previously mentioned by Joaquin and Darren, the innovative medicine business continues to grow through Stelara's loss of exclusivity, driven by our in-market portfolio.\nWe continue to advance our pipeline, attaining significant clinical and regulatory milestones that will help drive sustained and accelerating growth through the back half of the decade. In MedTech, while we still have work to do, we saw improvement over Q1 results, driven by strong performance in the cardiovascular portfolio, surgical vision, and wound closure in surgery. We remain focused on higher growth markets, enhancing competitiveness to gain market share and executing against our transformation initiatives to improve margins. Let's get into some of the financial commentary, starting with our cash position. Pre-cash flow through H1 2025 exceeded $6 billion, which accounts for elevated tax payments related to the final annual TCJA toll tax payment when compared to H1 2024.\nWe ended the second quarter with $19 billion of cash and marketable securities and $51 billion of debt for a net debt position of $32 billion. These figures include the debt raised for the $14.5 billion Intra-Cellular acquisition, which closed on 2 April 2024. Regarding talc litigation, we expect the Daubert hearing to commence this fall and look forward to the court re-examining the junk science the Mass Tort Plaintiffs Bar has funded to promote baseless talc claims against Johnson & Johnson. Turning to our full-year guidance for 2025, driven by the strength of our first half performance, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full year by approximately $900 million. We are now expecting operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 4.5% to 5%, with a midpoint of $92.9 billion, or 4.8%, representing a full point better when compared to prior guidance.\nExcluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, our adjusted operational sales growth is now expected to be in the range of 3.2% to 3.7% compared to 2024. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements, and last quarter we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.11. the U.S. dollar has weakened across all major currencies since April. Last week, the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar was 1.17. We estimate an incremental positive foreign currency impact of $1.1 billion versus previous guidance. As such, we now expect reported sales growth between 5.1% and 5.6%, with a midpoint of $93.4 billion, or 5.4%. Currently, our guidance does not include the impact of the most favored nation concepts.\nWith respect to MFN, we share the administration's goal that American patients should pay less by addressing the real drivers of higher US costs, including middlemen driving up prices and foreign markets not paying their fair share. Turning to other notable items on the P&L, at the beginning of the year, we guided to an approximate 300 basis points improvement in operating margin. Despite what you may have calculated on a year-to-date basis, we remain confident and reiterate our operating margin guide for the full year. This is due to efficiency programs designed for margin improvement, as well as non-recurring one-time IPR&D charges that occurred in the second half of 2024. This expected improvement also takes into consideration the dilution from the Intra-Cellular transaction, as well as what we know today about the impact of tariffs on our business.\nDuring our Q1 conference call, we anticipated an impact from tariffs in 2025 to be approximately $400 million. Based on the current tariff landscape, we now anticipate the impact to be approximately $200 million, exclusively related to our MedTech business. We will look to reinvest the differential to continue to accelerate our pipeline and further power the launch of our new products, those on the market with new indications, and those with near-term anticipated approvals. We continue to monitor what the future year's impact could be from tariffs on our business. For net interest expense, we now project between $0 and $100 million, an improvement from the previous guidance, primarily driven by higher interest earned on cash balances.\nOur effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 17% to 17.5% for the full year, with the increase largely due to an adjustment to the company's global tax reserves. We are pleased that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides certainty for our previously announced $55 billion commitment to invest here in the United States. This includes provisions such as permanent expensing for domestic R&D spend, permanent bonus depreciation, and 100% expensing of qualified production property, including our newly planned facility in North Carolina. We also welcome the improvements that were made to the international tax system. For your modeling, it is worth noting that the tax rate on foreign earnings, known as GILTI, is increasing by approximately 2% from a statutory rate of 10.5% to 12.6%. This will result in an approximate 1% increase to our global effective tax rate in 2026.\nTurning to earnings per share, we are pleased to increase our reported adjusted earnings per share estimate by $0.25-$10.85, or 8.7% at the midpoint, for a range of $10.80-$10.90, which is a combination of operational improvement and the favorable foreign currency dynamics I referenced earlier. Embedded in that is $0.08 of adjusted operational earnings per share, increasing our guidance to $10.68, or 7% at the midpoint. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on phasing for your models. We continue to expect both innovative medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. Regarding innovative medicine, we maintain the assumption that Stelara's biosimilar competition will accelerate throughout the year, with erosion similar to Humira's in year two, which is still our proxy, with the additive unfavorable impact of Part D redesign.\nTurning to MedTech, we anticipate an acceleration in growth to be driven by the increased adoption of newly launched products in cardiovascular surgery and vision. We continue to expect normalized procedure volumes and typical seasonality patterns throughout the remainder of the year. Beyond our financial commitments and what Joaquin has already referenced, we are excited for the expected pipeline progress in the remainder of 2025. In innovative medicine, this includes expected approvals in TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, subcutaneous RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S., Tremfya subcutaneous induction for ulcerative colitis, and Caplyta for adjunctive major depressive disorder. Anticipated filings for approval include Icotrokinra in psoriasis and Tremfya in psoriatic arthritis. As far as data readouts, we are planning for RYBREVANT in head and neck cancer and Icotrokinra in ulcerative colitis, as well as head-to-head data versus SOTYKTU in psoriasis.\nIn MedTech, we continue to make progress with our clinical trials for our OTTAVA robotic surgical system. In our cardiovascular portfolio, we are planning regulatory submission for dual-energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF catheter for cardiac arrhythmia in the U.S., an Impella ECP submission in heart recovery, as well as JAVELIN and Shockwave E8 launches in circulatory restoration outside of the U.S.. In orthopedics, we will be launching a ATTUNE Revision Hinge and a new plating system called VOLT in the U.S.. We will also be launching the ECHELON 4000 stapler with 3D reloads in surgery and the Acuvue Oasys Max in vision for astigmatism. In summary, I trust you agree the results delivered in the first half are evidence that our portfolio has the breadth and depth that enables us to attain growth, even in the face of a major LOE where very few, if any, other company could.\nThe clinical advancements provide a robust base for accelerated top-line growth, not just for the remainder of this year, but for the back half of the decade. We're confident that the strength of our business model enables Johnson & Johnson to navigate a dynamic external environment while delivering on our financial commitments. This is directly attributable to the hard work and dedication of our 138,000 colleagues who focus daily on advancing our pipeline, increasing market share, and progressing breakthrough treatments to patients that create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, and with that, we are happy to take your questions. Kevin, will you please provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q&A?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. If you'd like to be placed into the question queue, please press star one on your telephone keypad.\nIf you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star then the number two. Please limit your questions to one question only. Once again, that's star one to be placed into question queue, and please ask one question then return to the queue. Our first question is coming from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live. Great.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks so much for the question. J&J obviously reported a very strong top-line beat despite the Stelara LOE. And I'd just be interested, Joe, in any color you might higher up in terms of the drivers of upside to the guidance for the year as we think about how much of this is innovative business versus MedTech, and then any particular franchises in those businesses that's driving the guidance raise. Thank you.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah. Good morning, Chris, and thank you very much for the question.\nI would say both are contributing in terms of the strong performance. In fact, I would say this is a great opportunity for Jennifer and Tim to address some of the strength that we saw in our second quarter results, as you saw, and credit to Jennifer and her team achieving the first $15 billion quarter despite $1.2 billion of year-on-year erosion in the quarter from Stelara. I don't think any other company can do that. Then, Tim, notable improvement from what we reported in Q1 that gives us a lot of enthusiasm for the balance of this year. As you heard in my earlier comments, we expect both businesses to actually continue that momentum and grow better in the second half than the first half. Why don't I turn it over to Jennifer and Tim to give you some insights from their perspective.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks so much, Joe, and good morning, everybody. Joe, you stole my thunder on the over $15 billion in our first $15 billion quarter. Importantly, if you take a look at the 90% of our business that is not Stelara, we actually had extraordinarily robust growth, 15.5% growth, really demonstrating the strength across our portfolio. We had 13 brands that were growing double digits, and as we take a look at those, the vast majority of those are not only our growth drivers for today and tomorrow, but are also key growth drivers out through the end of the decade. So a few of the notable drivers there. So first, in oncology, Darzalex continues to perform very well. Carvykti performed well. Erleada. And we're really pleased with the launch uptakes thus far on Rybrevant plus Lazcluze in non-small cell lung cancer.\nIn immunology, Tremfya is off to a great start in ulcerative colitis and also Crohn's disease. Across neuroscience, both Spravato and Caplyta both had really, really strong performance for the quarter. As I mentioned, 13 brands with double-digit growth. I won't go into all of those, but really, really strong across the base of our business. We're really excited throughout the rest of this year because we've got a number of additional catalysts that are coming through with additional approvals and such. Tim?\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Chris, to your question, I mean, for MedTech, we were happy with our Q2 operational growth of 6.1%. This is a 4.4% sequential improvement over the first quarter. I think you know the primary contributors, certainly cardiovascular, 22% growth.\nWe are by far and away now one of the largest and certainly the fastest-growing MedTech company in cardiovascular, not only on the back of the success of the Abiomed and Shockwave acquisitions, but also the tremendous improvements you saw in our electrophysiology business, which, by the way, has a $5 billion base. And so tremendous performances there. We also saw great results in vision, primarily driven both by contact lenses as well as almost double-digit growth in surgical vision, and then continued solid growth in surgery, especially on the back of our performance in wound closure and biosurgery. Both of those businesses, multi-billion-dollar businesses, by the way, growing close to 7%. As we look to the back half, what gives us confidence in continued acceleration is a couple of things. Firstly, it's important to remember that Q1 and Q2 had difficult prior-year competitors.\nBut more importantly, what gives us confidence is the further acceleration as we continue to shift our portfolio into higher-growth markets and really bring truly differentiated innovation to market. In cardiovascular, that will continue with Abiomed, which continues to add to our portfolio. But more importantly, the evidence base around the benefits of Impella continues to impress, both with the DanGer Shock study and the recent ACC and guidelines supporting Impella use in patients with cardiogenic shock. Shockwave, two new products this launch, E8 as well as Javelin, which will further drive our performance, specifically in the peripheral space. And then with EP, you're going to see continued performance of Varipulse, and we'll add to that with the addition of the dual-energy STSF catheter in the European Union. In vision, this is a true turnaround story. We're seeing tremendous results, especially with our Tecnis and PureSee IOLs.\nJust to put that in context, in the U.S., we had our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, growing 13%. In the back half of the year, you'll also see the launch of the Acuvue Oasys Max 1-Day multifocal for astigmatism. I know there's a lot there. Well, this is the world's first and only daily disposable lens for people with both astigmatism and presbyopia. In surgery, we continue to see performance. Expect continued performance on the back of Surgiflo, Evicel, and Stratafix. I will call out that while our Ottava performance was softer than we would like, we have strong reasons to believe in continued acceleration through the remainder of the year with roughly 18 510(k) approvals last year, close to 40 outside the U.S.. Big launches are coming our way, especially in the areas where we face the most competition.\nHips and knees, we have the VELYS Uni Knee ATTUNE Revision Hinge, as well as KINCISE 2.0. Then also in spine, we're seeing the rollout of our spine VELYS robot, as well as TriALTIS, which we are confident that will continue to bolster our growth and competitiveness. So I think in summary, due to easier comps as well as significant new products, we're confident in continued acceleration in the back half.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSo Chris, as you can see, it's hard to pick one particular product that gives us reason for our enthusiasm in the back half. But if I had to point and maybe pick a couple of favorite children, I would say Tremfya. We're just getting started with our inflammatory bowel disease, and we grew 30% in the quarter. Those indications will provide further growth. As a reminder, STELARA's had 70% of their prescriptions within IBD.\nLooking forward to getting the subcutaneous administration approval for lung cancer with RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE. And then on the MedTech side, I think the really shining star, while maybe not the highest number, is the EP energy that we have going forward, either maintaining or recapturing that market leadership position, as well as expected improvement in our contact lens business. You saw about 3% growth this quarter with the launch of one-day ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day that treats presbyopia and astigmatism. We think there's even higher growth ahead on the horizon.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Great.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Chris, for the question. And Kevin, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. You mentioned oncology target of $50 billion by end of the decade. Looks like that's well above consensus.\nJust wondering if you could point us to the largest deltas that you see there. I know you've talked about TAR-200 in the past, but maybe any other areas. And then on Rybrevant subQ, can you just confirm that you've responded to the CRL and what the target review date would be for that approval? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks. Hi. It's Jennifer again. We feel really confident in that $50 billion target for our oncology business. It's really based on the strength across the base of our business. You can take a look at multiple myeloma with Darzalex and a lot of continued growth opportunity. Carvykti, also a $5 billion plus brand. We've got Tecvayli and Talvey. We might come to it later, trispecific that we've started outlining and presenting data on. So multiple myeloma, we anticipate to continue to be a stronghold.\nWe've got a really nice franchise in prostate cancer right now with Erleada that is growing very well. You mentioned TAR-200. That is probably the asset that has the biggest disconnect between our internal forecasts and what the street expects. We're really excited for this product and to be launching it in the second half of the year with the ability to truly transform the treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. There has not been much innovation there in a very, very, very long time. And we think we're going to bring new hope. The data that we've presented there looks fabulous. We've really designed this product by urologists, for urologists to seamlessly fit into routine clinical practice. And we really think that we've got a winner there.\nAnd if you just take a look, I think, boy, we see if you take a look at 2028 consensus, we actually see our numbers at least three times higher. So that's a big disconnect. And then again, this is oncology. There's a lot to talk about. Last on Rybrevant plus Lazcluze. So quick update, the launch is going very well. As a reminder, Rybrevant plus Lazcluze is the first and only regimen that provides really clinically meaningful overall survival to patients greater than probably 12 months versus Osimertinib. If you think about new patients, newly diagnosed patients, they want to live longer, and they do not want to be using chemo in a first-line setting. And so we think we've really got the winning combination and are poised to become the new standard of care in that front-line lung cancer, EGFR mutated lung cancer.\nThis is another one of our $5 billion-plus assets. In terms of the launch, while we're still early in it, as Joaquin had noted, the intent to prescribe has grown consistently, and we're now the number one regimen that providers are claiming that they intend to prescribe for those front-line patients. We've done a great job of penetrating. We're already in nearly 100% of our high-priority accounts. If we take a look really across the lines of therapy, 1 out of every 4 patients across those lines of therapy is now being initiated on a RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE combination. So making really nice progress here. Key to that continued growth is the subQ dosage. We have responded to the agency. This was not anything where the agency required any further clinical studies or clinical data. This was a manufacturing-related question or two.\nSo we've responded, and we're looking forward to the second half and hopefully getting approval on that.\n\nJohn Reed\n\nEVP of Innovative Medicine R&D, Johnson & Johnson\n\nTerence, John Reed here. If I could build just a little bit on Jennifer, we've had really great momentum in the oncology pipeline. In the last 18 months, last year and a half, I think we've had eight what we would call proof-of-concept readouts that then gave us the confidence to now move into late-stage pivotal studies across the portfolio. Since you asked about RYBREVANT, I would also remind you that we're in advanced studies now for colorectal cancer, which will be a huge opportunity for patients and for our portfolio. We're now moving into head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with really exciting data there in our early development program.\nOn the bladder cancer side, of course, TAR-200 is the star of the portfolio now, but right on its heels is TAR-210 with a targeted therapy where we've seen complete responses north of 90%. So that is an entire platform for us, and we'll be putting other payloads in those devices in the future. And then in myeloma, we've got a trispecific now coming, Remantamig. We're never satisfied with the status quo, building on TEC and TAL. And in that, at the recommended phase 2 dose for patients who had never seen a BCMA or a GPRC5D, 100% overall response rate. So we really see a great opportunity there to continue to elevate the standard care of myeloma. And then finally, in prostate cancer, we have great momentum across our pipeline.\nMost recently reporting, for example, an exciting bispecific T-cell engager, Pasritimag, that we think has enormous potential to really transform the practice of medicine in prostate. So the momentum across oncology is very robust.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGreat. Thanks. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Joe, the guidance implies an acceleration in the top-line growth in the second half of this year. Do you see the 3.5% adjusted operational growth this year as something you could accelerate from next year? And do you see room to improve the operating margin next year beyond the implied, I think, 32.8% in the 2025 guidance? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah. Good morning, Larry. Thanks for the question. In terms of overall sales guidance, we're obviously not going to provide that today.\nBut I think when you look at these quarterly results and the momentum that we have with our inline brands receiving new indications, that certainly, and then you complement that with what Jennifer, John, and Tim have outlined in terms of new product introductions, we certainly see 26 being better than 25 in terms of the growth rate based on what we know today. In terms of margin accretion, I'll reserve and keep the powder dry until we get a little bit further into this year. We still have some of the effects of Part D redesign that is impacting margins this year. We'll have to see how tariffs play out. The raise of $0.25 per share in the outlook incorporates $200 million of costs for this year.\nBut there's an accounting function, and I don't want to get too wonky here, in that some of that gets hung up on the balance sheet. So I'd like to see a little bit more things come into view before we really comment on margins. But we certainly appreciate and live by the principle that you have come to know us for, and that's growing our bottom line consistent, if not better than our topline.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Larry, for the question. And Kevin, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Next question is coming from Asad Haider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Great.\n\nAsad Haider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the questions and congrats on very solid performance in the quarter.\nMaybe just going back to the external environment, double-click a little bit more on your comments on pharma tariffs specifically, given this announcement last night from the president that we're going to see something by the end of the month that's going to start off with a low tariff rate and give companies a year to build. So what do you make of this announcement? And do you have sufficient capacity today to manufacture for the U.S. market in the U.S.? And how flexible is your manufacturing supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to adjusting for any tariff impact in 2026? Thank you.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you for the question. This is Joaquin. It's hard to know what is going to happen ultimately with tariffs. But what we do know for sure is that the tax policies that just passed are already creating American jobs and driving innovation.\nThese very policies that just passed are the ones that have enabled our commitment to invest $55 billion in the U.S. in the next four years. Our goal is to be able to manufacture in the U.S. all the medicines that are consumed in the U.S. at the completion of that plan. We are on our way of being able to do that.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGreat. Thanks. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\n\nShagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets\n\nWell, great. Thank you so much. So just two product questions on the MedTech side. On OTTAVA, it looks like you pushed out the submission timeline to 2026. Can you just elaborate on what's going on there? And then on your EP strategy, you did talk about low neuro rates.\nBut I was just wondering if you could share some feedback that you're getting from doctors around appetite for adoption of Varipulse. Just what are you hearing? Thank you.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, Johnson & Johnson",
    "content2": "Well, thank you, Shagun. And just to clarify, we haven't pushed out our timelines at all. In fact, we've met all of the milestones that we've communicated to the market, both in terms of submission late last year, approval late last year, starting the clinical trials in patients in Q1 of this year, and our expectation that we will file for De Novo submission in Q1 of next year. And so feel very confident about the progress that we're making on Ottava. I think you know clearly why we feel that we have strong differentiation in that program, both on the robot itself as well as our digital environment.\nAnd we'll continue to provide updates as that comes to fruition. I would like to touch a little on EP, and I appreciate you asking that question because when we look at our performance in the second quarter, clearly that was a major contributor. And it wasn't just EP. It was the 22% that we enjoyed across the cardiovascular portfolio, which is a combination of the performance, by the way, double-digit growth in both Abiomed and Shockwave ahead of our deal model expectations and improved performance in electrophysiology. And I have to say, Shagun, that given that we created the EP category, for us, this one is very personal. And while I know that several analysts were quick to write us off earlier this year, we continue to remain very confident in our ability to retain our global market leadership position over the long term.\nThat growth you saw in the second quarter, 10%, keep in mind that's of a $5 billion base. That represented a sequential growth of over 9% versus Q1 and acceleration within the quarter. To your question, what drove this? It really was the continued adoption of Varipulse as we expanded in all commercial regions. We also started first cases in new markets like China, which is a major market for us, and Australia. The feedback from physicians has been phenomenal. We've now surpassed 10,000 cases globally with a reported neurovascular event rate of below 0.5. This is well below what we observed in the Admire IDE trial and consistent with published rates across other competitive PFA platforms. We're also further optimizing the catheter based on real-world evidence and partnership with clinicians.\nIn fact, we recently received FDA approval for an IFU update to incorporate an optimized flow rate, which further advances the product's performance. We're also evaluating new ways for Varipulse to maximize ablation efficiencies and potentially widen its therapeutic window. I will say, and I'll say it very bluntly, we are confident that we have a highly competitive catheter in Varipulse. It provides excellent safety and precision. It's efficient with only four ablations per vein and a smooth learning curve, even for first-time users. And it's also important to mention that Varipulse accommodates competitive advantages like the only approved zero-fluoro solution and deep sedation workflows, which we know are a major benefit to hospitals and patients. And as we look beyond Varipulse, we are bringing to market a comprehensive portfolio of next-generation PFA catheters to address a broad range of workflows and patient needs.\nI think you know already that we received EU approval for our dual-energy STSF catheter, the first catheter offer of both PFA and RF technology. We're also working on an OmniPulse large-tip focal catheter and announced positive trials in the month of April. I do think it's also worth reinforcing that our strength, as we said from the very beginning, is not just down to ablation catheters, but rather the breadth of our portfolio and the end-to-end solutions we provide to our electrophysiology customers. It's our entrenched footprint and installed base of 5,000 CARTO systems, which is widely recognized as the benchmark in mapping software. It's our broad network of highly trained mappers, which we continue to expand.\nAnd just to highlight this point, the strategic differentiation of CARTO and our mappers has, even in light of the competition we face here in the U.S., enabled us to retain our leadership in mapping US PFA cases. And finally, it's our market-leading navigation and ultrasound catheters, further strengthened with the recent launch of the SoundStar Crystal ultrasound catheter earlier this year. EP is currently, I think it's fair to say, probably the most exciting category in MedTech. And let me be clear, we are not rolling over. We are, in fact, increasingly confident that our 30 years of experience and our full portfolio of offerings positions us well to continue to retain our global leadership position over the long term. Thank you, Shagun.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Shagun and Tim. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Alex Hamm from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\n\nAlex Hamm\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for taking the question. For TAR-200, can you walk us through J&J's launch strategy? Are there salesforce training, supply chain, patient access, and urologist education programs in place? And as a follow-up, how are you thinking about the ultimate patient penetration here?\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHi. Thanks so much for that question. So first of all, we think that there is an extraordinary opportunity here. There's 600,000 new patients that are diagnosed each year and another 400,000 that are recurrent. So we really see the opportunity as quite large. We'll be entering in the first indication in patients that are experienced or have failed BCG. But shortly thereafter, we'll be expanding into that broad non-muscle-invasive space. And so we do think that there's a lot of patients that are eligible for treatment. I think this product really represents the best of what J&J can bring forward.\nWe have capitalized not only on the strength of innovative medicine in developing this, but also the strength of MedTech, with everything from the engineers to catheter development to the J&J institutes, the training that they have run, really, really best in class, best in industry, so that we can bring forward a product that will very, very quickly be able to work with urologists, with their practices, and to help get this product out to patients. I'm not going to go into all the details around the launch planning, but suffice to say that the planning is very, very well underway, and the team is very excited for what we optimistically think is going to be a very successful launch for patients here.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Alex. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter. Darren, what a great quarter to start. So just a question on MedTech. I mean, you guys are already growing closer or in line with the broader market. You do have some underperformers still in MedTech and surgery and orthopedics, but you've highlighted a few avenues from a new product launch perspective and improving execution to getting those back to in line with market growth. You're weathering EP headwinds. So if we look ahead to 2026, 2027, is it fair to think of the MedTech business as closer to high single-digit growth business?\nI mean, how do we think about the impact of these new product launches and some of the underperformers, the potential for them to re-accelerate, and what that means, given that you're already back to sort of 5+% growth in MedTech, even with them continuing to underperform? I hope that question makes sense. Thanks so much.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nNo, it does, Danielle, and thank you. There's firstly a couple of drivers that we're very confident will continue to perform extremely well and accelerate as we look to the next few years. Certainly, our performance in cardiovascular, as I mentioned, the 22% growth in the second quarter, we believe that's going to be a constant growth driver. Surgery, while you point it out, has been, I'd say, an underperformer relative to some of our new entrants in that space.\nWe are very confident that we're going to build on our leadership position, both in open and laparoscopic surgery with the launch of Ottava, which you know is on the horizon. I'd say the two biggest growth drivers for MedTech going forward will be cardiovascular and our surgery business, especially as we enter the robotic space. We believe that our vision business will continue to be a mid-single-digit to high single-digit performer. We continue, as I mentioned earlier, to look at how we continue to improve our performance in our orthopedics and getting that up to in-market performance. You know that in late 2024, we mentioned that as part of the EBR, we would grow in that roughly 5% to 7% range at the upper range through 2022 to 2027 on an operational basis. We're very confident in our ability to deliver that.\nI wouldn't want to speculate beyond that at this point in time. Thank you, Danielle.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Danielle. We have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\nGreat. Thanks for getting in my question. And again, congrats on the quarter and the performance. So I just had one pipeline question on the innovative medicine side. That's on your co-antibody therapy 4 to 4. So I thought we might see some of the psoriatic arthritis data already this year. You are, but we didn't see that, and I thought we were hoping to see the IBD data later this year. So I'm just wondering if you can maybe give us an update on when we should expect to see those two readouts.\nAnd then just your general level of enthusiasm, I assume you have at least some of this data in-house. You've had a chance to see how the competitive dynamics are playing out in the immunology space. So I'd love to just kind of get an updated sense of your perspective on 4 to 4's potential. Thank you.\nYeah, John Reed here. Maybe I'll start, and then others can supplement. But the 4804 studies, these are phase 2b's, one in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We'll be reading out sometime middle of this year. So it's nearing the time when the data may become available. And then based on that, we'll make decisions about next steps.\nAs you know, in the earlier phase 2A study, we saw really compelling data there that it looked like this combination of an IL-23 inhibitor together with a TNF inhibitor, two products that have been in our pipeline, but coming together could break through the traditional efficacy ceilings in patients with difficult-to-treat inflammatory bowel disease and give perhaps more than half of those patients the chance at sustainable complete remission. So we're excited about this co-antibody therapeutic. It will be the first of many such approaches to trying to address these difficult-to-treat patients down the line. And so we're excited to be in a leadership role there, the first company to really begin this kind of foray of looking at going beyond monotherapies to dual therapies to address this really complex patients.\nI would say, while I'm on that, though, I'm super excited about our Icotrokinra, the oral targeted peptide inhibitor of the IL-23 receptor, which did achieve a compelling proof of concept in ulcerative colitis. We'll be showing those data later this year at a medical meeting. We have begun gearing up now to do a broad phase 3 campaign in both UC and Crohn's disease based on those compelling data. And we think we're on the cusp of being able to offer the convenience of a once-a-day pill together with efficacy on par with the best of the biologics and with a pristine safety profile. So a lot of momentum in immunology across multiple indications, but IBD in particular.\n\nDarren Snellgrove\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Vamil, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your interest in J&J. I'll now turn the call over to Joaquin for some closing remarks.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you for joining the call today. Our Q2 results reflect the depth and strength of our uniquely diversified business. And as you heard, we expect elevated growth in the second half of the year. We have a lot to look forward to over the next six months with game-changing approvals and submissions anticipated in areas like lung and bladder cancer, major depressive disorder, psoriasis, surgery, and cardiovascular. These milestones will extend and improve lives in transformative ways and deliver significant value to patients and shareholders. Thank you for your continued interest in Johnson & Johnson and enjoy the rest of the day.\nThank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."

You may begin.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHello everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for Q1 2025 and our updated financial outlook. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2024 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will open with a few comments on our performance and key catalysts for the company. John Reed, our Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine R&D, will highlight recent data from select assets. I will then review the Q1 sales and P&L results. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then close by sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2025.\nJennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, and Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last slightly over 60 minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess, and hello, everyone. In the Q1, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 4.2% across our business. Our Q1 performance reinforces my confidence in our 2025 guidance and reflects the strength of Johnson & Johnson's uniquely diversified business with year-over-year sales increases in both our innovative medicine and MedTech sectors. No other healthcare company has delivered growth through the first year of lucent exclusivity for a multibillion dollar product, in our case STELARA. Yet that is exactly what we are doing. Our resiliency is a testament to what makes us unique. We are not just a pharmaceutical company or a MedTech company. We are a health care company innovating across the full spectrum of disease. Our consistent, strong performance is a testament to our capabilities across commercial R&D and supply chain.\nIt is also a reflection of our strength in execution, which you can see in our quarterly results.\nWe have described 2025 as a catalyst year. It is a year that will set us up for accelerated growth through the second half of the decade and beyond. In Q1, the power of our portfolio and pipeline was on full display in Innovative Medicine. We delivered 4.2% operational sales growth despite an approximate 810 basis points headwind from STELARA, with 11 key brands growing double digits, with our third consecutive quarter of sales above $3 billion. DARZALEX continues to set the standard in multiple myeloma with another quarter of over 20% growth. In fact, just last week we expanded our DARZALEX indication in Europe with the approval of a DARZALEX based quadruplet regimen for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma regardless of transplant eligibility.\nIt is further proof of the impact of this medicine, which together with CARVYKTI, TALVEY, and TECVAYLI, is changing the conversation from treating to progression to treating to cure. Other significant oncology portfolio advancements in Q1 included Phase III data presented at ELCC last month showing Rybrevant plus Lazcluze extended overall survival by more than one year versus the current standard of care in first-line EGFR mutated lung cancer. Last week, the European Commission approved subcutaneous Rybrevant in combination with Lazcluze for the treatment of EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer. This was an important milestone for patients as subcutaneous Rybrevant reduces administration time from hours to minutes. Our aspiration is for Rybrevant plus Lazcluze to become the new standard of care for these patients, and you can see our progress in Q1.\nIn immunology, we're seeing the impact of TREMFYA's entry into inflammatory bowel disease, with our launch in ulcerative colitis helping accelerate operational sales growth to 20%, and with our recent FDA approval in Crohn's disease, I'm more confident than ever that this blockbuster drug will become the gold standard for IBD patients and a $10 billion plus product. Turning to MedTech, in Q1 we delivered 4.1% operational sales growth with strong performance in our recently acquired cardiovascular businesses Abiomed and Shockwave, as well as in surgical vision and wound closure. In addition to their contribution to MedTech growth, Abiomed and Shockwave continued to meet deal model expectations, and both announced important portfolio milestones this quarter.\nThese included updates to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for our Impella heart pump, which, based on evidence from the DanGer Shock trial, was upgraded from Class IIb to Class IIa. In Shockwave, the team launched the first-of-its-kind Javelin peripheral IVL catheter for the treatment of difficult-to-cross lesions in peripheral artery disease. In electrophysiology, we resumed US Varipulse cases, and to date we have completed more than 5,500 cases globally. Turning to surgery, we recently announced we have started OTTAVA clinical trials with a procedure that supports submission for US FDA De Novo in general surgery with an indication for multiple upper abdomen procedures.\nThis is an important milestone, and as we continue to strengthen our presence in robotic surgery beyond our existing portfolio and pipeline, we also fortified our leadership as an innovation powerhouse with two major announcements. In March, we announced our commitment to invest more than $55 billion in the US over the next four years in manufacturing, R&D, and technology. This represents a 25% increase in investment compared to the previous four years. It builds upon the company's already elevated commitment to the US economy while expanding our capacity to manufacture next-generation medicine and devices for patients in America and around the world. The investment includes four new manufacturing facilities, the first of which broke ground last month in North Carolina.\nAt the beginning of April we announced the completion of our acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies which extends Johnson & Johnson's industry-leading portfolio in central nervous system disorders. With the addition of CAPLYTA, we have expanded our lineup of therapies with at least $5 billion plus potential in peak year sales, further solidifying sales growth above analyst expectations now through the rest of the decade. Turning to the talc bankruptcy ruling, as we shared a few weeks ago, we will return to the tort system where we expect continual success in litigating these meritless claims. In terms of next steps, we will immediately pursue our motion pending in a multidistrict litigation to exclude plaintiffs' experts known as the Daubert Challenge. Finally, as announced this morning, we increased our dividend for the 63rd consecutive year which we know is important to our shareholders.\nWe had a strong start to 2025, and I'm looking forward to sharing many more successes throughout the year. Recognizing that there have been many important milestones and data readouts in the quarter, I will now pass the call to John Reed for an Innovative Medicine R&D update.\n\nJohn Reed\n\nEVP and Innovative Medicine R and D, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joaquin. I'm excited to share a few highlights from our industry-leading innovative medicine pipeline that occurred throughout the quarter with the successful acquisition of Intra-Cellular. I want to focus on CAPLYTA, a remarkable medicine with balanced pharmacology that delivers robust efficacy combined with a favorable tolerability profile for neuropsychiatric disorders. CAPLYTA is already approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and is the only medicine approved for the treatment of depression in both bipolar I and II as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. On this slide, we're sharing data for major depressive disorder showing very impressive and consistent improvements in the standard depression scoring metric, MADRS, in both Phase III studies that served as the basis for submission of the supplemental new drug application to the FDA.\nWe anticipate approval of CAPLYTA later this year and as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, representing the largest of the indications for novel antidepressant drugs today.\nTurning to oncology, we are so excited about our recent overall survival data for Rybrevant plus Lazcluze in first-line non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most prevalent type of lung cancer, making up about 85% of lung cancer diagnoses. Sadly, less than 20% of people diagnosed with this form of the disease are alive after five years, and only a fraction live long enough to try a second treatment. That's why it is so important to use the best treatment first.\nIn a head-to-head study against today's standard of care, our Rybrevant plus Lazcluze regimen improved overall survival by more than a year, with the Kaplan-Meier survival curves continuing to separate at 37.8 months median follow-up. With Rybrevant's triple mechanism of action, we're looking to reset the standard five-year survival expectations in a never-before-seen way. In simplest terms, we are giving patients more hope that they may live to celebrate another birthday, anniversary, or other important family event. A truly practice-changing achievement. Now moving on to immunology, I draw your attention to the recent FDA approval of TREMFYA in Crohn's disease.\nOur fourth indication for TREMFYA, TREMFYA is currently the only IL-23 inhibitor with the flexibility of subcutaneous administration for both induction and maintenance dosing for the treatment of Crohn's disease, which means patients can start their treatment by self administering with results as rapid and robust as receiving the IV in a clinic or doctor's office.\nAdditionally, in a recent head to head study in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, TREMFYA demonstrated superiority versus STELARA in all pooled endoscopic endpoints. As the only dual acting IL-23 inhibitor, TREMFYA neutralizes IL-23 while also binding to CD64 and immune cells that produce IL-23, thus localizing TREMFYA right at the source of inflammation. TREMFYA continues to offer an exceptional solution for patients struggling with inflammatory bowel disease.\nLastly, highlighting some of our latest data for our investigational oral IL-23 pathway inhibitor Icotrokinra, we are aiming to redefine the standard of care for people living with plaque psoriasis. Icotrokinra is the first and only targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor. In two placebo-controlled Phase III studies, Icotrokinra demonstrated impressive complete skin clearance and a favorable safety profile in a once-daily pill. Our Phase III data demonstrated that nearly half of adult patients, and three quarters of adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with Icotrokinra achieved completely clear skin by week 24. We also reported that Icotrokinra achieved the prespecified endpoints in additional Phase III psoriasis studies comparing our molecule head-to-head with the most commonly prescribed Tyk2 inhibitor. Those data will be shared in an upcoming medical congress.\nLooking forward, we are initiating the first-ever head-to-head study seeking to demonstrate the superiority of a pill, Icotrokinra, compared to an injectable biologic, STELARA, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, representing an important step forward in psoriasis research. As a reminder, we intend to file Icotrokinra for approval later this year. Finally, beyond psoriasis, we recently announced positive top-line results from Anthem UC, our Phase IIb study of Icotrokinra in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. That study showed that Icotrokinra achieved impressive clinical remission rates combined with a favorable safety profile, again dosed as a once-daily pill. With all this progress, you can understand why we continue to be excited about the potential of Icotrokinra to transform the treatment paradigm for patients battling with autoimmune diseases overall across all our therapeutic areas.\nWe are absolutely thrilled with the progress that our pipeline has made in the Q1 of this year, and we are eager to report on other significant milestones scheduled for the remainder of 2025. Now I will turn the call over to Jess.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, John. Moving to our financial results, unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q1 2025 sales results, worldwide sales were $21.9 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 4.2% despite an approximate 470 basis points headwind from STELARA. Growth in the US was 5.9% and 2.1% outside of the US. Worldwide growth was positively impacted by 90 basis points due to acquisition and divestitures. Turning now to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $11 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $4.54 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.34 a year ago, primarily driven by the reversal of $7 billion related to the talc settlement proposal, excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items.\nFor both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.77, representing increases of 1.9% and 2.2% respectively, compared to the Q1 of 2024. We are proud to deliver bottom line growth despite the loss of exclusivity of STELARA and the impact of Part D redesign. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter, beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $13.9 billion increased 4.2% despite an approximate 810 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in the US was 6.3%, and 1.5% outside of the US, starting with oncology. DARZALEX's growth was 22.5%, primarily driven by continued share gains of approximately 3 points across all lines of therapy and approximately 5 points in the frontline setting, as well as market growth.\nCARVYKTI achieved sales of $369 million and growth of over 100% driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects sequential growth of 10.5% as we continue to expand outside of the US, TECVAYLI and TALVEY growth was 15% and 50.2 respectively, reflecting strong launches in the relapsed refractory setting. Patient demand remained strong despite continued adoption of longer dosing intervals. Erleada continued to deliver strong growth of 14.6% despite the impact of Part D redesign primarily driven by share gains and market growth. Rybrevant plus Lazcluze continued its strong launch trajectory with sales of $141 million and growth over 100%. Within immunology, TREMFYA delivered growth of 20.1% despite the impact of Part D redesign driven by share gains and market growth across all indications including our newly launched indication and ulcerative colitis. STELARA declined 32.3% driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign.\nAs a reminder, Remicade and Simponi distribution rights in Europe were returned in Q4. This positively impacted results in the quarter and is anticipated to continue for the remainder of the year. Remicade sales also include a one-time patient mix benefit in the US in neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 42.9% was driven by increased physician and patient demand. Finally, other assets that were impacted by Part D redesign include Invega long-acting injectables, which declined 13.5%; pulmonary hypertension, which declined 1.2% and was partially offset by market growth and share gains; and XARELTO, which increased by 33% and also included a one-time patient mix benefit. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech.\nWorldwide sales of $8 billion increased 4.1%, with growth of 5.1% in the US and 3% outside of the US. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 280 basis points on worldwide growth, 420 basis points in the US, and 120 basis points outside of the US. Underlying MedTech performance was driven by commercial execution and strength of new products, partially offset by several one-time events disproportionately impacting orthopedics. In addition to continued competitive PFA pressures in electrophysiology and headwinds in China, results were negatively impacted by approximately 210 basis points worldwide, 240 in the US, and 180 outside of the US due to these one-time events. In cardiovascular electrophysiology, growth was roughly flat versus prior year, driven by lapping of prior-year inventory dynamics in Asia, impacting worldwide results by roughly 310 basis points, and competitive PFA ablation catheter pressure.\nThis was mostly offset by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution. Abiomed delivered growth of 14%, driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella CP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $258 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. As a reminder, we will lap the acquisition benefit at the end of May. Vision contact lenses and other grew 2.7%, driven by continued strategic price actions, and strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS one-day family of products. Surgical vision growth of 6.2% was driven by our recent innovations TECNIS Odyssey, PureSee, and Eyhance, as well as commercial execution partially offset by competitive pressures. In the US, surgery grew 1.1% with divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 180 basis points.\nPerformance was driven primarily by commercial execution and the continued strength and adoption of new products across wound closure and biosurgery. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters as well as the negative impact of China VBP. Given the disproportionate impact of the one-time events to orthopedics, I'd like to draw your attention to this additional slide. Orthopedics declined 3.1%, but primarily driven by the lapping of a one-time revenue recognition, timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the US. Fewer selling days and revenue disruption from the previously announced orthopedics transformation. These one-time events negatively impacted worldwide orthopedics growth by approximately 480 basis points, 650 basis points in the US, and 210 basis points outside of the US. This was partially offset by success of new product launches and commercial execution.\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the Q1 of 2025, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 320 basis points driven by unfavorable transactional currency and product mix primarily due to the decline of STELARA in Innovative Medicine as well as the fair value step up and amortization associated with the Shockwave acquisition. In MedTech, selling, marketing, and administrative expenses improved 130 basis points driven by operating spend, management and phasing of investments primarily in Innovative Medicine. Research and development expenses leveraged by 190 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio progression towards commercialization and phasing of investments in Innovative Medicine, partially offset by investments associated with the recent acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech.\nInterest income and expense with a net income of $128 million as compared to $209 million in the Q1 of 2024, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on higher average debt balances. Other income and expense was a net income of $7.3 billion compared to an expense of $2.4 billion in the prior year, driven by the $7 billion talc reserve reversal in the Q1 of 2025 and the $2.7 billion talc settlement proposal recorded during the Q1 of 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 12.4% in the same period last year, primarily driven by the tax effect of the reversal of the talc settlement accrual. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year.\nI encourage you to review our upcoming Q1 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided the company's income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. New this quarter, and to continue our efforts of increased financial transparency, you will find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations by segment in the supplemental schedules of our press release. Innovative Medicine margin declined from 42.9% to 42.5 primarily driven by unfavorable transactional currency, and product mix, and cost of product sold, and Part D redesign partially offset by operating leverage.\nMedTech margin declined from 26.4% to 25.9, primarily driven by R&D and selling, marketing, and administrative investments associated with the recent acquisition of Shockwave and V-Wave. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 36.8% to 36.6. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call and I will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Thanks, Jessica. Not just for the transition now, but also for how well you have led the investor relations function the past few years. The investment community will miss you, but we look forward to seeing you in the lead finance role for Innovative Medicine. Our Q1 results demonstrate the strength and reliability of Johnson & Johnson's diversified business model. Innovative Medicine achieved robust growth in the face of STELARA biosimilar entrants, and we advanced our pipeline, attaining significant clinical and regulatory milestones in MedTech. As indicated in January, we anticipated pockets of challenge early on and are planning for higher H2 growth in those areas of our business. The team is focused on commercial execution and accelerating the recently launched products to deliver MedTech's commitments that are included in the company's full-year guidance.\nThe recent acquisitions of Abiomed and Shockwave continue to expand our presence in higher growth markets. In addition, we continue to take steps to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our surgery business similar to what we launched in Orthopedics in 2023. Focusing on portfolio renewal, we plan to exit certain non-strategic product lines globally and optimize select sites across the network. We anticipate some modest short-term revenue disruption in surgery of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, but these actions will improve our ability to accelerate growth and enhance profitability. The program is expected to be completed in 2027 with costs estimated at approximately $900 million. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We are pleased with free cash flow generation in the quarter of approximately $3.4 billion.\nWe ended Q1 with $38.8 billion of cash and marketable securities, and $52.3 billion of debt for a net debt position of $13.5 billion. It is important to note that cash and net debt were favorably impacted by approximately $14 billion of cash held in anticipation of the Intra-Cellular acquisition, and which closed on April 2. Taking this into consideration, net debt would have been approximately $27.5 billion. Investment in innovation remains the highest priority in our capital deployment, and during Q1 we invested more than $3 billion in research and development, approximately 15% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders. We recognize the value investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors authorized a 4.8% increase, marking our 63rd consecutive year of dividend increases.\nThe Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition bolsters our neuroscience portfolio, and we maintain a disciplined approach to inorganic growth, focusing on acquisitions and partnerships that align strategically and offer value creation. As noted in our Talc Investor call and following up on some of Joaquin's earlier comments, we reversed $7 billion of the reserve previously held for the bankruptcy plan. This litigation has not, and we foresee will not, impact our ability to execute upon our capital allocation priorities to appropriately manage our business. Let's now discuss our full-year guidance for 2025. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full year by $700 million to reflect the addition of CAPLYTA following the completion of the Intra-Cellular acquisition. Therefore, we now expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 3.3% to 4.3 with a midpoint of $92 billion, or 3.8%.\nExcluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 2% to 3 compared to 2024. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements and last quarter we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of 1.04. Last week the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar was 1.11. We estimate an incremental positive foreign currency impact of $1.1 billion versus previous guidance, resulting in a full year headwind of $600 million. As such, we now expect reported sales growth between 2.6% and 3.6% with a midpoint of $91.4 billion or 3.1%. Turning to other notable items on the P&L, we are maintaining our guide of operating margin improvement by 300 basis points versus 2024.\nThis improvement takes into consideration the dilution from the Intra-Cellular transaction as well as what we know today about the impact of tariffs on our business.\nWe now project net interest expense between $100 million and 200 million, primarily driven by financing costs associated with the Intra-Cellular acquisition. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1 to 1.2 billion, a slight increase versus previous guidance despite $0.25 dilution from the Intra-Cellular acquisition and including the impact of tariffs. Based on what is in place today, we are pleased to be able to maintain our adjusted reported earnings per share guidance of 6.2% at the midpoint for a range of $10.50 to 10.70, partially aided by the reduced FX impact. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on phasing for your models. We continue to expect both Innovative Medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half.\nRegarding Innovative Medicine, we maintain the assumption that the impact of STELARA biosimilar competition will accelerate throughout the year similar to Humira's erosion curve, which is still our proxy, with the additive impact of Part D redesign. The impact of Part D redesign on ex-factory products as a percent of sales will be consistently applied throughout the year, aligned with how we traditionally account for similar discount and rebate programs. Naturally, we expect a greater benefit from our newly launched products as the year progresses. Regarding MedTech, we expect normalized procedure volume and seasonality, and of course we anniversary the Shockwave acquisition at the end of May. We anticipate our newly launched products to build throughout the year with the relaunch of Varipulse in the US, the introductions of Dual Energy STSF in the EU, VELYS Uni, VELYS Spine, and TECNIS Odyssey.\nLastly, this slide highlights the one-time prior year P&L items that should be taken into quarterly consideration for your models. Beyond our financial commitments and what Joaquin and John mentioned, we are excited for the Pipeline Progress Plan for the remainder of 2025 in innovative medicine. This includes expected approvals in Nipocalumab for generalized myasthenia gravis, subcutaneous Rybrevant for non-small cell lung cancer in the US, TREMFYA subcutaneous induction for ulcerative colitis, and CAPLYTA for adjunctive major depressive disorder. We continue our rolling submission of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and anticipate filing Icotrokinra in psoriasis and plan data readouts for Rybrevant in head and neck cancer and Icotrokinra in ulcerative colitis as well as head-to-head data vs STELARA in psoriasis.\nIn MedTech, we continue to make progress with clinical trials for our OTTAVA robotic surgical system and across our cardiovascular portfolio, including heart recovery with Impella ECP submission and circulatory restoration with Javelin and Shockwave E8 launches. This progress will bode well for financial performance for the balance of this decade. In fact, building on John's earlier discussion on our Innovative Medicine pipeline and what I just outlined, I'd like to revisit and update a slide that we shared at our Enterprise Business review in late 2023. In that slide, you may recall, we highlighted key assets in our portfolio that we expected to drive long-term growth and projected higher revenue than street estimates.\nWe've been pleased to see that some estimates have been raised since the 2023 Enterprise Business Review, and now I'd like to walk you through some of our current thinking on our pipeline potential to show where we see even more upside. Based on current 2027 street estimates, our projections are at least two times higher for Rybrevant plus Lazcluze and at least 50% higher for SPRAVATO. One asset that we didn't highlight in this look back in 2023 was TREMFYA. However, given recent regulatory approvals for inflammatory bowel disease, we now see sales for TREMFYA at least 25% higher than current street estimates. When looking ahead to 2028, we anticipate sales for our intravascular drug releasing system, previously referred to as TAR-200, to be at least three times higher than current street estimates.\nNew to the chart, Icotrokinra, our targeted oral peptide, to be at least two times higher to be balanced. Analyst estimates are still a bit more optimistic than our own estimates on Nipocalimab in 2027. However, we do anticipate closing that gap after launch. We have even stronger conviction today in our growth opportunities than at the Enterprise Business Review as we've reached new milestones with each of these medicines. Importantly, we expect all these assets to achieve peak year sales beyond 2028, with further potential upside to street estimates in the outer years. Even after considering risk adjustments for unapproved products that you may apply. Hopefully you'll also conclude there is additional value to your outlooks. In summary, it was a solid start to the year.\nJohnson & Johnson's diversified business model uniquely positions us to tackle the headwinds in 2025, deliver on our financial commitments, and advance our pipeline to create long-term sustainable value for shareholders. Thank you. And with that, we are happy to take your questions. Kevin, will you please provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q&A?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. We're now conducting a question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, press star then two. We ask you, please limit yourselves to one question only. Our first question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nLawrence Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Device Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a nice quarter. Joe, you talked about $400 million in tariffs in this 2025 guidance, or about $0.14 by our math. What is that on an annualized basis and how are you thinking about being able to mitigate that over time? Can you pass along.\nPass it along to customers or can you offset it by moving production? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, thanks, Larry. Good to hear from you. So what's included in the $400 million? And again, that is primarily MedTech tariffs at this point. It's based on the programs that have been announced and the timing that correlates with those programs. So that would be inclusive of Mexico and Canadian import tariffs that are not excluded out of USMCA. It'll include to a very small degree some of the steel and aluminum tariffs that impact some of our products. It includes the China tariffs as well as the China retaliatory tariff. And that is probably the most substantial out of all the tariffs in terms of that $400 million.\nJust to maybe clarify for everybody, that is products of US origin being shipped into China, and that's probably the most penalizing factor, that $400 million. I don't want to be cavalier about that. It's obviously the program has been phased in as a partial year, and then you have mostly this being captured as cost of goods. So it's going to sit on the balance sheet in inventory and be relieved through the P&L in future periods. So that's how we're thinking of it in terms of mitigation strategies. I think, you know, across our entire business, we're very limited in terms of price leverage, whether it be on the MedTech side. There's contractual agreements already in place, and certainly very much precluded on the pharmaceutical side on current products that exist in terms of taking price increase.\nI know Joaquin has a few thoughts regarding tariffs, and maybe other mitigation factors, and the supply nature of healthcare.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joe. Thank you, Larry, for the question thinking about tariffs and thinking specifically about pharmaceutical tariffs. There's a reason, Larry, why pharmaceutical tariffs are zero. It's because tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages. If what you want is to build manufacturing capacity in the US, both in MedTech and in pharmaceuticals, the most effective answer is not tariffs, but tax policy. As a matter of fact, since President Trump's 2017 tax reform, the investment in manufacturing, both in MedTech and in pharmaceuticals, has significantly increased.\nWhen you think about our recent announcement of investing $55 billion over the next four years, at the completion of this investment plan, essentially all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured in the US. So tax policy is a very effective tool to be able to build manufacturing capacity here in the US both for MedTech, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nLarry, I just want to follow up too. You did ask about a full year impact, and I will say I purposely ignored the question only because it would be way too speculative at this point. As we know, these tariffs are very fluid. The responsible action for us now is to quantify what we see the impact in 2026 and then see what happens with respect to does it lend itself to negotiations with other countries and what's actually in place as we get into the later part of 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks so much. Just had a question on gross margins in the quarter. It seems like these came in well below recent trends. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of the drivers there and just the outlook going forward as we consider Mexico tariffs, et cetera on t e gross margin line. Thank you.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHey Chris, this is Joe. Thanks for the question.\nSo I'd say there's a two-part answer to this one. So specifically in the quarter, when you look at Q1 2024, we obviously had the impact of STELARA, which was a much higher gross margin product than our average product. In our portfolio, you had Part D, which is exclusively price, which is eroding margin. And then you had some, I would say, transactional currency headwinds: one, a favorable impact last year or in 2023 funneling into 2024, and then some unfavorability from last year's currency action. I would expect, moving forward, based on some of the plans that we have, you could expect that 300 basis points to probably improve by 1/3 to 50%, and that would be inclusive of the tariffs that I just mentioned in Larry's question.\nThe other thing I would say is I know you guys do a great job, but I think analysts were maybe a little bit optimistic with respect to their outlook for gross profit. Given that we had STELARA and Part D certainly communicated in the past, I believe the consensus was taking gross margins up year-over-year and that one was probably a little bit of a miss. So we probably could have done a better job explaining it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Asad Haider from Goldman Sachs, line is now live.\n\nAsad Haider\n\nHead of US Healthcare Business Unit, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the question. Just going back to the STELARA biosimilar erosion and the acceleration of the trajectory that we're going to see over the course of the year. Are you able to provide any quantitative framing on your views as it relates to the extent to which you think this erosion gets smoothed out by the transition to other brands like TREMFYA and other products? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson\n\nWell, good morning. Thanks so much for the question. It's Jennifer. So what we saw with STELARA in Q1 was definitely in line with our expectations for the product for the year, and we continue to guide to the Humira two-year erosion curve once there were multiple biosimilars as really the best model there. And make sure, you know, also including the additional impact of Part D redesign. If I could, you know, one additional point around STELARA, if we take a look at the business overall, it was highlighted that we had 4.2% growth across Innovative Medicine. That included a -810 basis points impact from STELARA.\nIf you exclude that from our business, the remaining business, the bulk 90% of our business, was actually growing at over 12%, really demonstrating the strength of our overall business and with 11 key brands that were growing double digits. So yes, we've got the STELARA LOE, but the strength of the business is really coming through across all of our growth drivers.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nI would add to that.\nIt is remarkable that in a year in which we are facing the headwind of the STELARA biosimilars, Part D redesign, we are able to grow even in the Q1. That we are able to do it like any other company to my knowledge in the health care industry has done. It is a testament to the strength of our business, to the diversification of our growth platforms, and it gives me a strong belief that we are going to continue to deliver throughout the year.\n\nJohn Reed\n\nEVP and Innovative Medicine R and D, Johnson & Johnson\n\nJoaquin and Jennifer. Just building on the focus on STELARA, of course, as STELARA begins at sunset. TREMFYA continues to rise. You've seen the recent approvals in inflammatory bowel disease where TREMFYA now is available as the only IL-23 class medicine for sub-Q delivery in both induction and maintenance. We have generated additional strong data going head to head against STELARA in a rigorous double-blind study and showing the superiority across all mucosal endpoints. So that's really disease-modifying healing. And then finally, I would say you'll see later this year data in psoriatic arthritis where we've done a rigorous study looking at preservation of joint, avoiding the joint erosion that leads to long-term disability. And what you'll see in those data when they're presented is a best in disease profile for TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis.\nSo really excited about the progress with TREMFYA, the world's first selective IL-23 inhibitor.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Thanks so much too for all the color on tariffs and the ortho impacts. That was super helpful. And Jess, we're really going to miss you. But congrats and good luck in your next work role. Just a quick question on, you know, and maybe this isn't really a question, I don't know. But I think it's still on the table and that do we or don't we go into a recession? And I'd love some color as much as you can provide on how you guys think about your business and how recession proof it is, isn't, and what areas might be most at risk of underperforming relative to where we are today in a recession. Thanks so much.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHey, Danielle, good to hear from you. Yeah, it's a good question. I think, when, you know, we think about our business, the one thing we look to is certainly jobs reports in the US, and as of the most recent reports, it seemed to be pretty healthy. The reason we look at that is because it's a precursor as to who may have benefits and coverage for prescription medications as well as procedures inclusive of elective procedures. We have seen in times past when there's been a little bit of a recession that some of those elective procedures maybe get delayed, but they don't get abandoned. And I'm thinking primarily within orthopedics. You know, healthcare overall has proven to be, while nothing is immune to a recession, a little bit more recession proof than most other industries. So we'll continue to monitor that.\nRight now we feel good about the standards of care that we're elevating on both the Innovative Medicine and MedTech side of the house.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nOverall health care demand remains solid, and we feel good about the rest of the year. Regarding procedures and use of pharmaceuticals, I don't know any comments on that, Tim?\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSure. Further to Joe's point, Danielle, the category such as advanced IOLs is a good precursor to really assessing the health of the economy. So far we haven't seen any impact on the performance of our IOL portfolio. In fact, we've seen the opposite when you look at the performance of our IOL business on the back of the launch of both TECNIS Odyssey here in the US and PureSee globally. We're seeing benchmark performances and, frankly, a turnaround of our performance here in the US with truly differentiated innovation. So far, no major headwinds.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director and Biotech Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question, Joe, we heard your. Comments this morning on the Section 232. You know, potential pharma tariffs being focused more towards generics API versus the complex branded biologics. So, just wondering if that's based on your impression the most likely outcome here? Or that's more just your speculation or hope for the outcome. Thank you.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nLet me take that question, Terence, myself. So we are analyzing Section 232. It was already announced previously, so it's something that we consider normal that is going to happen. Overall, adding to my comments on tariffs before, I think it's also important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain so as to avoid any continuity of supply effect. It's important for us to partner with the administration and with the government.\nWe plan to do it in. This process to make sure that we have enough market manufacturing capacity here in the US to be able to address multiple scenarios.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nTerrence, just to be clear that we want to be deferential to the administration and their process, that is speculative just looking at the pharmaceutical landscape and where, you know, national security interest may reside and what products that those are delivered from. That was really kind of our take on it. We are working and engaging with the administration and being deferential to their process.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director, Citibank\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the question and providing all of this information. Very helpful. I do want to sort of just pause for a second on the orthopedic sales and try to unpack how much of that is. Which variable is there a way to quantify it, and how do we think about the recovery in the back half of the year and then into next year?\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson",
    "content2": "Joanne, thank you for the question. As we mentioned, we've tried to provide as much transparency as possible to the significant impact of one-timers in the quarter, which to your point have disproportionately impacted the ortho business to the tune of roughly 480 basis points. There are three key drivers to that: number one, the lapping of prior year change in locking implants revenue recognition; fewer selling days; and finally, revenue disruption from the recent ortho transformation, which we announced in 2023. So when you actually look at our operational growth when accounting for those, it would be closer to 2% now. At the same time, I will say, Joanne, we're not satisfied. Our underlying performance was impacted by competitive pressures, primarily in spine and sports, which is partially offset by strong NPIs and commercial execution in categories like trauma, shoulder, and foot and ankle.\nWhat gives us confidence in continued acceleration to the back half of the year is the incredible impact of truly differentiated innovation across our ortho portfolio. In fact, in 2024 we had 18,510 approvals here in the US and 45 outside of the US across our portfolio. What gives us confidence is this combination of having best in class implants with truly differentiated enabled technology such as VELYS in our hips portfolio. We believe we're going to see continued performance on the back of our focus on anterior approach, both with ACTIS VELYS and KINCISE 2.0. In knees, we have seen a slowdown in revisions where I think, you know, we are historically number one, but feel very confident about continued momentum in primary. With a combination of ATTUNE and VELYS, which is now available in 30 markets, we have 110,000 procedures.\nAs you probably know, we're now launching the VELYS Uni knee.\nIn the coming quarters. In trauma, this was a standout quarter for us, close to 7.3% operational growth when you account for the one timers. This was driven by tremendous uptake of our VOLT Plating System and the feedback we've got from surgeons, especially for our small frag. Our mini frag in our distal radius has been exceptional. I think you also know that spine has been a bit of a laggard for us in the ortho portfolio. We are now effectively launching the TRIALTIS Spine system, which is a thoracolumbar system coupled with VELYS Spine also launching in the coming quarters. So, not the best start, but strong confidence in improved performance the remainder of the year in ortho.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now live.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions and for all the information. So I just want to maybe focus on that Slide 29, Joe, that you talked about. I don't know if this is for you, Joe, or for Jennifer. Appreciate you sharing your perspectives on those products and how they differ, your expectations differ from consensus. There's three products that are not on there anymore that were there at the end of 2023, and that's CARVYKTI, TALVEY, and TECVAYLI. And I don't think the consensus expectations have changed for those very much since then. So maybe you can just talk about what has changed there, why those aren't listed. Has anything changed from your internal perspectives or again, externally that just had those come off of that list. Thank you.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHi Vamil, this is Jess. Yes, you're absolutely correct. The Multiple Myeloma portfolio was on the slide during the EBR in 2023, and they are not on the slide today. Not saying that there's still a disconnect, but it's just not to the extent of the other products on the list at that time. We had estimated, if you did the math on the slide, it would have been about $4 billion that would have been added to 2027. Around $2 billion was added. So those estimates did go up at that time. Again, not that there's still a disconnect. It's just not to the extent of the others on the slide because those estimates were increased.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nJust to be super clear on that one, Vamil, we are still extremely bullish based on the clinical progression R&D as well as the performance that we're seeing in the marketplace. I mean, look at CARVYKTI, I think doubled sales year on year. So it's just a matter that.\nYou guys took your numbers up. So we agree, I guess, is maybe the best way to say that.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson\n\nMaybe just to add in a little bit more on CARVYKTI. So, yeah, over 100% operational growth in Q1 and we continue to make very strong share gains in that second line plus indication. We continue to add sites, we continue to add countries, and capacity expansion globally. So we have very firm conviction in CARVYKTI as a $5 billion+ asset and really are rolling that out globally very effectively at this point in time. We don't see capacity as a constraint going forward based on the strength of the efforts that have taken place. You know, we're full speed ahead for CARVYKTI going forward.\n\nJohn Reed\n\nEVP and Innovative Medicine R and D, Johnson & Johnson\n\nAnd with TECVAYLI and TALVEY here, you know, we're really just getting started. You've probably seen some of the recent data where we've even combined those two molecules to achieve really unprecedented levels of complete responses. At the hematology meetings last year, we also showed combining either TECVAYLI or TALVEY with DARZALEX and demonstrating really impressive 100% minimal residual disease negativity in earlier lines of therapy. The opportunity therefore to really start bringing these first-in-class bispecific T-cell redirecting molecules into earlier lines, even frontline, in combination with our DARZALEX. Really enormous opportunity lies ahead of us with TECVAYLI and TALVEY.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson\n\nA couple other things on TECVAYLI and TALVEY, so we continue to expand. We've got very good penetration in the academic settings right now, and we continue to expand out into the community. We've got very strong new patient starts. I know that the products have been plagued a little bit because the product is so effective with some less frequent dosing. As we move forward, we should be lapping that soon. And really you'll see the strength of those new patient starts and the continued expansion into the community starting to show through. Combined then with what John talked about in terms of additional combinations and such. We've got very strong convictions and remain convinced on the opportunities for TECVAYLI and TALVEY.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and appreciate all the color. I had a clarification and a question if I could. So the question first. Would be great if you could maybe flesh out the way that.\nThe opportunities in TREMFYA, which is now kind of leaning into IBD and the emerging opportunities for Icotrokinra in oral, now you see them coming together this year, next year, the year after as kind of a portfolio in immuno, and then clarification if I could just for Tim, it sounded like when you were describing the ortho impacts something like 2% but if you look at the hip and knee math, if I'm right, it looks like about 2% in the US. I just want to make sure I understand. It sounded like your view was that's share, that's on us and we're going to remedy that with innovations and new products this year. Maybe you know, just put too fine of a point on it but like that's not market growth. Like 2% like you would say we're below market and we should be doing better.\nOr do you think that, you know, that's kind of where the market's at, is in that like low single digit range for us? Hips and knees. Thanks so much. Apology for the long clarification, but it'd be super helpful. Thanks.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson\n\nMatt. Let me start with your question on Ortho. To be perfectly frank, while we have seen an improvement in our performance both in hips and knees through 2024, Q1 clearly wasn't our strongest quarter. So we have seen competitive pressures. As you know, these are highly attractive categories within MedTech, within Ortho. It's where the primary fight is and frankly we need to do better. We believe that our performance so far in the quarter was slightly below market. These are attractive markets. We've seen strong, robust procedures across Ortho and we expect that to continue. As I mentioned, with the addition of our portfolio of both implants as well as enabling technology across hips and knees, we're confident that we will see an improvement through the remaining quarters.\nThank you.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGreat. So let's switch over to TREMFYA and Immunology. TREMFYA really had a great quarter in the Q1 with sales nearly $1 billion and over 20% operational growth. This was really driven by market share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as what we're seeing as it relates to the launch in ulcerative colitis and also in Crohn's disease. We are really encouraged by the launch in both of these IBD indications. TREMFYA is now, if we start with ulcerative colitis and how we're doing and then I'll go to Crohn's disease. So in ulcerative colitis, TREMFYA is the fastest growing product in the ulcerative colitis market. IL-23s are the fastest growing class, and TREMFYA has already achieved nearly 50% share of the IL-23 new patient starts in UC.\nSo this is really based on the strength of the profile of the product and the strong differentiation that we have as a dual acting IL-23, both impacting both IL-23 as well as CD64. The robust data that we have as it relates to efficacy and remission. And then as we get into Crohn's disease and then later in ulcerative colitis as well, what we see is unrivaled simplicity with the opportunity for sub-Q induction as well as maintenance dosing. When we take a look at market research data and, you know, intent to prescribe, the data comes through really strong that gastroenterologists really prefer TREMFYA over the IL-23 competitors based on those aspects that I just discussed. So, you know, efficacy, sustained remission, and mucosal healing. Right now for UC on Crohn's, there is very significant enthusiasm around our launch there and it's really quickly getting traction.\nIn the first few weeks since approval in Crohn's disease, patient initiation volumes are outpacing the other IL-23 launches in the market. And the polling data, our recent market research, 82% of gastroenterologists consider TREMFYA's induction dosing and flexibility to be a very positive dose differentiation in their treatment decisions. And they're seeing the efficacy profile to be quite compelling compared to the other therapies that are in the market. So we believe that in IBD, both in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, we're off to a strong start. And as a reminder, tracking back to STELARA, STELARA, 75% of sales were in IBD indications. We see no reason why TREMFYA wouldn't be the same or even better based on what we're seeing with the strength and competitiveness of the profile and maybe.\n\nJohn Reed\n\nEVP and Innovative Medicine R and D, Johnson & Johnson\n\nJust a comment on Icotrokinra, since you asked about that. The most proximal opportunity there is our psoriasis campaign where we will have altogether five Phase III studies data for that this year. We expect to submit this year for psoriasis. We're so excited to be able to offer patients more choice, you know, with even a market like psoriasis, which, you know, should be well penetrated by now because it is a place where some of the biologics first got their start. More than half of patients who are eligible for an advanced therapy are still not on advanced therapy. And for many of these patients, it's really an aversion to the injections and going the biologics route.\nSo, to be able to offer patients the choice of a once-a-day pill to provide a solution for their disease, which has efficacy in the same ballpark as the biologics and with that well-proven safety profile of the IL-23 class, is really exciting for us.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, we really believe that Icotrokinra is a big market expansion opportunity to get in those earlier lines of therapy and to bring patients into therapies that have that strong biologic like efficacy. We think that there is a lot of room for both Icotrokinra and TREMFYA in the market based on different patient needs, different physician needs as well. And so we think both of these are very important growth drivers for us going forward.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Matt. Kevin, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you so much. Going back to tariffs, you know, a big concern by investors is how that might ultimately wrap in transfer pricing structures. And every company I know is usually hesitant to talk about that. I'm wondering what J&J can offer up on that front that could include things like major products where you have transfer price structures in place, as well as which geographies you have those in place as well.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, I appreciate the question, Tim. It's just not something that for competitive reasons we're going to comment on.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson\n\nI would reiterate what I said before with our $55 billion investment plan. At the completion of that plan, which we spoke about four years, all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured here in the US. So that's our plan, and that's why we believe it's important to provide continuity. As I said before, after 2017, President Trump's tax reform, the level of investments in the US have increased and we plan to continue to increase it, given the current tax regime or improvements that may come into the. Future.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Tim. And thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. As many of you have seen, Darren Snellgrove will be transitioning into the investor relations role starting 1 May as I transition into the Innovative Medicine CFO role. The last three and a half years have been an absolute pleasure getting to engage with you all. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you. Jess. And thank you everyone for joining the call today. As you heard, 2025, it's going to be a catalyst year for Johnson & Johnson. And with our Q1 results, we are off to a great start. This start reflects the power of Johnson & Johnson's uniquely diversified business model and further strengthens our confidence in our 2025 guidance and beyond. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2025 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to our company's review of business results for the Q4 and full year 2024 and our financial outlook for 2025. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the investor relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nPlease note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the Company's future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.\nMoving to today's agenda, Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will open with a few comments on our performance and key catalysts for the company. I will then review the Q4 sales and P&L results, as well as full year 2024 results for the enterprise. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then close by sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2025.\nJennifer Taubert, John Reed, and Tim Schmid, our innovative medicine and med tech leaders, will be joining us for Q&A to ensure we provide enough time to address your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last a little over 60 minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a year of progress and transformation for Johnson & Johnson. Today we operate in a broad set of high unmet need, high growth, and high innovation segments including oncology, immunology, and neuroscience in Innovative Medicine and cardiovascular, vision, and robotics in MedTech. In 2024 we continue to make disciplined decisions to exit lower priority businesses while investing industry-leading amounts in our pipeline.\nApproximately $50 billion US dollars in R&D and M&A in the last year inclusive of the recently announced acquisition agreement with Intra-Cellular Therapies which I will speak about shortly. While we have been through a period of transformation, the fundamentals of our company remain the same. Indeed, our enduring success is rooted in two things.\nFirst, we are a purpose-driven company guided by our credo, and second, we are broadly diversified, meaning that we can truly lead where medicine is going. No other company has the span of expertise and capabilities that Johnson & Johnson has. No other company can impact the entire patient journey as we do. We are not just a pharma company or a medtech company; we are a healthcare company, and our strategies are disease-centric, focused on end-to-end solutions.\nJust think about multiple myeloma and the impact of Darzalex, CARVYKTI, Tecvayli, and Talvey. Think about heart recovery and the impact of Abiomed's Impella heart pumps and the promise of V-Wave and minimally invasive interatrial shunt. Think about mental health and the impact of our Invega portfolio, Spravato, and the potential of the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition we announced last week.\nThink about inflammatory bowel disease and the impact of Stelara and Tremfya and the potential of our targeted oral peptide that blocks IL-23, Icotrokinra, and JNJ-4804, our dual antibody therapeutic targeting IL-23 and TNF. As the only major healthcare company focused both on pharmaceuticals and medical technology, we are unique in the industry with the financial muscle, global reach, and R&D expertise to deliver the sustained high pace of growth and innovation that is the hallmark of Johnson & Johnson.\nStrategic decisions we made in 2024 position Johnson & Johnson for sustained growth through the second half of the decade and beyond and strengthened our confidence in our 2025 guidance. Now to the numbers for 2024. Over the full year, we delivered robust operational sales growth of 7% excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. We, with Spravato surpassing $1 billion US dollars in annual sales. We now have 26 platforms that generate at least $1 billion US dollars in annual revenue.\nIn Innovative Medicine, we reported a third consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion US dollars, with 10 key brands growing double-digit across the full year. We achieved strong growth in oncology, neuroscience, and pulmonary hypertension, with immunology performing well despite the entry of biosimilars for Stelara in the EU.\nEqually impressive is our pace of innovation, which in 2024 resulted in 27 approvals in major markets, including FDA approvals of Tremfya for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and Rybrevant and Lazcluze for first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. In 2024 we reported 18 positive readouts for registration studies, initiated 16 phase III studies, and submitted 49 filings across major markets.\nAs you have seen over the last three weeks, we are off to a fast start. In 2025, Rybrevant and Lazcluze showed significant improvement in overall survival in first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We received FDA approval of Spravato as the first and only monotherapy for adults with treatment-resistant depression.\nWe received priority review for Nipocalimab for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis, in addition to the FDA breakthrough-therapy and fast-track designations for other indications received last year. Last week we announced a new drug application with the FDA for TAR-200, our intravesical drug-releasing system for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, an area of significant unmet need impacting as many as 1 million patients per year.\nTurning to MedTech, and for the full year we reported a second year of over $30 billion US dollars in sales, with growth across most parts of the business, including particularly strong momentum in cardiovascular ambition. Our pace of MedTech innovation also continues to accelerate with 15 major products launched in 2024.\nMajor highlights of the year include the approval of our VARIPULSE pulsed field ablation platform in several major markets, and FDA clearance of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for the use in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty procedures, as well as an expanded FDA indication for Impella heart pumps to treat pediatric patients, and FDA clearance of Shockwave Javelin peripheral IVL catheter for the treatment of tight, difficult to cross peripheral lesions.\nWe also achieved the full market release of 10 major products, including the Shockwave E8 peripheral IVL catheter in the US, version 8 of the CARTO 3 electroanatomical mapping system, and our TECNIS Odyssey Intraocular Lens. We progressed 18 clinical trial programs, including the IDE approval of our OTTAVA Robotic surgical system, which allows clinical trials to begin at US sites.\nLast year we fortified our future by making significant value-creating investments in M&A. These investments enable us to further shift our portfolio to address unmet needs in high-growth and high-innovation markets. This included the acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech, and Ambrx, Proteologixs and the NM26 bispecific antibody in Innovative Medicine.\nBuilding on our nearly 70-year legacy in neuroscience, we announced last week plans to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system disorders. This unique opportunity to add Intra-Cellular Therapies reflects our commitment to transforming care and advancing research in mental health. It also further solidifies sales growth above analysts' expectations now and through the remainder of the decade.\nTogether these transactions represent industry leading levels of investment for the company, providing strategic, near-, and long-term growth catalysts for Johnson & Johnson. Turning to 2025 and as previously guided back at the end of 2023, we expect to deliver operational sales growth of 3%, overcoming headwinds associated with US biosimilar entries for Stelara and the impact of the Part D redesign and continued macroeconomic pressures in China.\nPerhaps even more impressive, we are planning for adjusted operational earnings per share growth of nearly 9%. I cannot think of any other company that would be able to deliver growth through the first year of losing exclusivity of a multibillion-dollar product. We are able to achieve these results because of the diversification of our business, the strength of our commercial assets, as well as the breadth of our pipeline.\nWith additional launches in 2025 including Tremfya in IBD, Rybrevant and Lazcluze in lung cancer, and VARIPULSE and the dual energy ThermoCool SmartTouch SF Catheter in electrophysiology. In closing, I want to thank everyone at Johnson & Johnson for all that they do to help patients. We are starting the year from a position of strength, and we have confidence in our sales growth and EPS guidance for 2025, and with that I'll turn the call over to Jess.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore excludes the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2024 sales results, worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 6.7%, with growth of 10% in the US and 2.5% outside of the US.\nWorldwide growth was negatively impacted by 290 basis points due to Stelara and positively impacted by 100 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures. It's important to note, growth in Europe was negatively impacted by 720 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of Stelara and the COVID-19 vaccine.\nTurning now to earnings for the quarter. Net earnings were $3.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.41 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.70 a year ago. Excluding after-tax, intangible asset amortization expense, and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $4.9 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.04, representing decreases of 11.1% and 10.9%, respectively, compared to the Q4 of 2023. Earnings per share in the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.22 of acquired IPR&D expense related to the V-Wave acquisition.\nFor the full year 2024, sales were $88.8 billion. Sales grew 5.9% with growth of 8.3% in the US and 2.9% outside of the US. Stelara and the COVID-19 vaccine negatively impacted worldwide growth by 260 basis points. Acquisition and divestitures positively impacted worldwide growth by 50 basis points.\nGrowth in Europe was negatively impacted by 670 basis points due to the COVID-19 vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of Stelara. Net earnings for the full year 2024 were $14.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $5.79 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.20 a year ago. Full year 2024 adjusted net earnings were $24.2 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.98, representing a decrease of 4.6% and an increase of 0.6% respectively versus full year 2023. Earnings per share in the year was negatively impacted by $0.67 due to acquired IPR&D charges on various transactions throughout the year.\nI will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $14.3 billion increased 6.5% excluding the COVID 19 vaccine, with growth of 11.1% in the US and a decline of 0.3% outside of the US. Stelara negatively impacted worldwide growth by 490 basis points. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with 10 assets delivering double digit growth. Results across the portfolio continue to be positively impacted by price adjustments associated with Argentina hyperinflation, consistent with market practice.\nStarting with Oncology, we continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. Darzalex growth was 23.5%, primarily driven by share gains of over three points across all lines of therapy and six points in the frontline setting, as well as market growth. This marks Johnson & Johnson's first brand to achieve over $3 billion in sales in a quarter.\nCARVYKTI achieved sales of $334 million with growth of over 100% driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects sequential growth of 17.3% aligned with our expectations of accelerating growth in the back half of the year. Tecvayli sales were $146 million in the quarter with growth of 18%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapse refractory setting. Demand remains strong despite continued adoption of longer duration dosing intervals. Finally, within our multiple myeloma portfolio, Talvey continued its launch trajectory with another quarter of strong growth.\nAs a reminder, we anticipate disclosing Talvey sales in the first quarter of 2025, which are currently reported in the category Other Oncology. Erleada continues to deliver strong growth of 22.7% primarily driven by share gains and market growth, reaching $3 billion in annual sales for the first time. Rybrevant, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer, contributed to growth in the category Other Oncology as we continue to expand approved indications. We also anticipate disclosing Rybrevant sales in Q1 2025.\nWithin immunology, we saw sales growth in Tremfya of 5.6% driven by strong market growth and share gains in PSO and PSA, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and inventory dynamics. We are excited about the recent UC launch and expect to see strong uptake of the IBD indications in 2025. Stelara declined 13.6% driven by the impact of current and anticipated biosimilar competition. As a reminder, biosimilar competition has entered the US in January 2025. Remicade and Simponi sales were positively impacted by return of distribution rights in Europe. In Neuroscience, Spravato growth of 45.3% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient demand.\nAs Joaquin mentioned, Spravato has exceeded $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. Other Neuroscience decline was driven by the loss of a Spinraza tender in Europe in pulmonary hypertension. Opsumit grew 2.5% driven by market growth and share gains, partially offset by inventory dynamics in the US and austerity measures in Europe. Starting in 2025, we will begin to report Opsumit which is currently reported in the category Other Pulmonary Hypertension.\nIn Opsumit, Uptravi grew 12.1% driven by market growth, patient mix, and share gains. Finally, Xarelto sales growth was driven by favorable patient mix. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 7.6% both in the US and outside of the US. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 300 basis points on worldwide growth, 430 basis points in the US and 150 basis points outside of the US.\nOverall MedTech growth was driven by commercial execution and strength of new product introductions, partially offset by increased competitive PFA pressures in US electrophysiology and continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, primarily in China. In Cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 7.3%. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution partially offset by competitive PFA ablation, catheter uptake in the US, and VBP in China.\nDespite the IV saline shortage in the US, Abiomed delivered growth of 13.2% driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $258 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. Contact lenses and other grew 7.4% driven by trade inventory dynamics, continued strategic price actions, strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, as well as lapping prior year impacts from Russia sanctions.\nSurgical vision growth of 13.6% was driven by TECNIS PureSee and TECNIS Eyhance. Commercial execution partially offset by competitive pressures in the US. Orthopedics grew 2.5% inclusive of hips growth of 5.6% primarily driven by the success of recent product launches and commercial execution, partially offset by revenue disruption from the previously announced orthopedics transformation, impacts of China, VBP, and competitive pressures. Lastly, surgery grew 0.4% with the Acclarent divestiture negatively impacting results by approximately 130 basis points.\nPerformance was driven primarily by commercial execution. Strength of new products across wound closure and biosurgery and continued price adjustments primarily associated with hyperinflation. Consistent with market practice. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters as well as VBP and the anti-corruption campaign in China.\nNow turning to our consolidated Statement of Earnings for Q4 2024, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels to fortify our future, investing $5.3 billion, or nearly 24% of sales, which includes $540 million of acquired IPR&D expense associated with the V-Wave acquisition. Selling, marketing, and administrative expense as a percent of sales deleveraged 150 basis points, driven by increased commercial investment in the Innovative Medicine business.\nInterest income and expense was a net income of $144 million as compared to $212 million of income last year, driven by lower interest rates earned on a lower average cash balance and higher interest rates on a higher average debt balance.\nOther income and expense was a net income of $161 million compared to $421 million of income in the prior year. This was primarily driven by lower gains on securities, a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs due to the discount rate, partially offset by lower litigation expense in 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 11.7% versus 14.4% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by post-acquisition integration efforts that allowed the company to deduct certain acquisition costs for tax purposes as well as the resolution of prior tax matters both in jurisdictions outside of the US.\nExcluding special items, the effective tax rate was 8.8% versus 10.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2024 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense, and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. Innovative Medicine margin declined from 37.4% to 32.5%, primarily driven by strategic commercial Investment and R&D pipeline advancement.\nMedTech margin declined from 15.5% to 10.8%, primarily driven by acquired IPR&D expense related to the V-Wave acquisition. Please note that the MedTech margin was negatively impacted in both years due to expenses associated with the strategic acquisition of Laminar. When adjusting for these one-time items, MedTech margin was relatively flat.\nAs a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 29.2% to 24.1% with the V-Wave acquired IPR&D expense impacting results by 240 basis points. When looking at the full year, Innovative Medicine, MedTech, and the Enterprise adjusted income before tax remained relatively flat year over year. When adjusting for the one-time items highlighted on the slide, mainly acquired IPR&D expenses on various transactions across both years. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you've heard already, we delivered solid overall Q4 and full year results in 2024, above the operational guidance we set at the beginning of the year when excluding acquisition costs we incurred to fortify our business for the future. We are particularly pleased with advancements made throughout the year, strengthening our pipeline, achieving key milestones across core therapeutic areas, and platforms.\nWe continue to prioritize investment in innovation, forge strategic partnerships that further enhance our differentiated business, and focus on improving margins, positioning the company for near- and long-term growth. Additionally, we've made progress toward resolving the talc litigation. As many of you are aware, our prepackaged bankruptcy plan received overwhelming support from current claimants and the Futures Claims Representative, and that support has only increased in recent months.\nThe next milestone is the scheduled confirmation hearing commencing on 18 February in the Southern District of Texas Bankruptcy Court. Now let's get into the numbers, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended 2024 with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $37 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $12 billion. Our focus on cash flow resulted in the company delivering approximately $20 billion of free cash flow during 2024, $1.6 billion more than in 2023, despite having higher litigation settlement payments during 2024, higher TCJA toll tax, and eight months of contribution from Consumer Health in 2023.\nOur ability to strategically invest and deploy capital that unlocks value has made Johnson & Johnson successful in the past and will be as important for our success moving forward. We value a strong credit rating, which underscores the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial discipline and enables us to execute against our capital allocation priorities. In research and development, we invested more than $17 billion, or 19.4% of sales. We remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. 2024 marked the 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases.\nWe know this use of capital is a priority for our investors, and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed to over $32 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months.\nThis amount includes larger transactions such as Shockwave, Proteologix, the NM26 bispecific antibody, V-Wave, the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, as well as more than 40 smaller early-stage collaborations and partnerships to complement our businesses that are much more common for us than larger transactions. As we look ahead to 2025, we will maintain a heightened focus on cash flow generation to build on our strong financial foundation and judiciously deploy capital on behalf of shareholders to create value. Let's now discuss our full-year guidance for 2025.\nIt is important to note that guidance at this time excludes the impact from the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, but I will provide some comments on that transaction in a few moments. We anticipate operational sales in the range of 2.5% to 3.5 with a midpoint of $91.3 billion or 3.0% in line with the expectation outlined at our late 2023 Enterprise Business Review as Joaquin noted. Acquisitions and divestitures are expected to favorably impact operational growth by approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an adjusted operational sales growth midpoint of 2.5%.\nSales growth across our innovative medicine businesses will be driven by our proven assets such as Darzalex, Erleada, and Spravato, our recently launched products CARVYKTI, Tecvayli, and Talvey, and our new launches of Tremfya in IBD and Rybrevant plus Lazcluze in lung cancer. The strength of our portfolio enables innovative medicine to grow despite expanded Stelara biosimilar competition and approximately $2 billion negative impact from Part D redesign.\nMedTech sales growth will be driven by our recent acquisitions Shockwave and Abiomed, and as well as continued uptake of our recently launched products such as VARIPULSE, TECNIS Odyssey, ACUVUE OASYS MAX, the VELYS portfolio of enabling technology, and our Barb Suture and Hemostat portfolio. We continue to expect China to remain a headwind through 2025. Regarding VARIPULSE in the US, we are working diligently to complete our investigation and will provide an update when we have additional information to share. As a reminder, there's no impact to commercial activity to VARIPULSE outside of the United States.\nAs you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. For today's call, we are utilizing yesterday's euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of 1.04, significantly below last quarter's euro spot rate of 1.10. This results in an estimated unfavorable foreign currency impact on sales of $1.7 billion or 2.0%. As such, we estimate reported 2025 sales of $89.6 billion or 1% growth at the midpoint. Turning to other items on the P&L.\nDespite Stelara biosimilar competition and the impact of Part D redesign, we expect our 2025 adjusted pre-tax operating margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points, of which approximately half is driven by operating spend management and the remainder from reduced acquired IP, R&D expense. This is about 50 basis points better than we discussed on the Q3 earnings call in October.\nWe anticipate net other income to be $900 million to $1.1 billion for 2025. The reduction versus last year is primarily driven by a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs and, based on discount rate assumptions, the non-recurring monetization of royalty rights in 2024, and no longer receiving a Kenvue dividend due to higher debt incurred associated with 2024 acquisitions and the reduction in interest rates earned on cash. We expect net interest income between $0 and $100 million. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2025 in the range of 16.5% to 17.0 based on current tax laws and our anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses.\nGiven all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 8.7% at the midpoint for a range of $10.75 to 10.95. While not predicting the impact of currency movements utilizing the recent exchange rate previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year now estimates a full year negative impact of $0.25. As such, we expect reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.60 at the midpoint. When adjusting for this impact, it becomes clear that our operational EPS performance is considerably stronger than consensus assumed, as only about half the analysts incorporated the impact of foreign currency into their models.\nA few initial considerations outlined on this chart regarding the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, a transaction we plan to finance mainly with debt, we are not planning for material near-term cost synergies. Rather, we expect to accelerate penetration of Caplyta in existing markets, explore additional geographies to commercialize the portfolio, and potentially accelerate research and development to expand into new indications and disease areas where high unmet need exists. Given this, and assuming a close subject to regulatory review early in Q2, we anticipate an acceleration of our sales growth of approximately 80 basis points.\nInclusive of the impact of financing cost, tThe transaction is expected to have a dilutive impact on adjusted EPS of approximately $0.30 to 0.35 in 2025. Again, these are very preliminary thoughts, which will be influenced by when the transaction closes and borrowing rates. We will be sure to provide an update to our full year guidance shortly after the acquisition is complete.\nI'll now provide some qualitative considerations on the phasing of notable events for your modeling. We expect both Innovative Medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. Regarding Innovative Medicine, we anticipate Stelara biosimilar competition to accelerate throughout the year as the number of biosimilar entrants increase. Humira's erosion curve, once faced with material biosimilar competition, continues to be the best proxy for Stelara erosion with the additive impact of Part D redesign. The impact of Part D redesign as a percent to sales will be consistently applied throughout the year.\nWe expect a more pronounced benefit from our newly launched products as we progress throughout 2025. To counter these headwinds in MedTech for the first half of the year and more prominently in Q1, we face tougher year-over-year comparisons.\nExcluding the positive impact associated with the Shockwave acquisition, we anticipate acceleration of our newly launched products to build throughout the year. As we said before, we continue to expect normalized procedure volume and seasonality. Regarding the P&L, it is important to consider one-time items that impacted our EPS results in 2024. Specifically, the benefit of Kenvue dividend in the first two quarters of 2024 is not repeating, higher interest income prior to the Shockwave acquisition closure in May. The monetization of royalty rights recorded in Q3, and IPR&D expense associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody in Q3, and V-Wave acquisition in Q4.\nGiven these factors and aligned with sales, we expect higher earnings per share growth in the second half of the year versus the first half. Moving the discussion beyond financial commitments, we are excited for the pipeline progress planned for 2025. In Innovative Medicine, this includes expected approvals for Tremfya subcutaneous for Crohn's disease, Nipocalimab for generalized myasthenia gravis, and subcutaneous Rybrevant for non-small cell lung cancer.\nWe expect to file for regulatory approval of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and Icotrokinra in psoriasis, and planned data readouts for Rybrevant lung cancer overall survival, as well as data in head and neck and colorectal cancer, and Icotrokinra in ulcerative colitis, as well as head-to-head data versus Sotyktu in psoriasis. In MedTech, building upon the 15 major product launches in 2024, we anticipate a submission to the FDA for Impella ECP regulatory approval, continued progress on our OTTAVA Robotic Surgical System, and advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio including electrophysiology, heart recovery, and circulatory restoration.\nSo, to summarize, we are well positioned to tackle the challenges in 2025, continue to advance our pipeline, deliver on our financial commitments, and create long term sustainable value for shareholders. Our success is the result of the hard work and dedication of our colleagues who share a sincere passion to successfully serve patients around the world. We are extremely grateful for their efforts. With that, we are happy to take your questions. So I will now turn it to Kevin to provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll be conducting a question and answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, press star then two. We ask you, please, limit yourselves to one question only. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Obviously a myeloma franchise is a very important growth driver as we think about history, but also 2025. So just wondering if you can kind of frame for us how you're thinking about that, both from the specifics as well, as CAR-T and maybe a broadening into the community setting and the pace of growth here as we think about the ramp in 2025. Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGreat. Well, good morning Terence and hello everybody. I'd like to start by thanking all of our Innovative medicine colleagues around the world for a very strong quarter. This was our Q3 with sales over $14 billion US dollars with 10 key brands achieving double-digit growth. And Terence, I'll come back to that. That includes brands like Darzalex, CARVYKTI, Talvey, and Tecvayli as well as ones such as Erleada, Spravato, and Uptravi. We're making really nice progress on our launches, including Tremfya in ulcerative colitis and Rybrevant plus Lazcluze in non-small cell lung cancer.\nAnd just an important note, we hit our $57 billion US dollar target this year a year early. For those that were here back at our Enterprise Business Review, we had made that commitment to hit the $57 billion US dollar by 2025 and we cleared that goal this year in 2024.\nSo multiple myeloma is really an extraordinary franchise for us. And maybe I will start with Darzalex because our quarter was over $3 billion US dollar. It was $3.1 billion US dollar and 22% growth. And we continue to really build out share across, you know, the frontline settings in both transplant eligible, and ineligible patients and in triplet and quad regimens. And so we're performing very well for Darzalex and anticipate that to continue. And in fact, with Darzalex, it's our first brand to hit $3 billion in quarterly sales. So important to note that milestone too.\nCARVYKTI had a really, really robust quarter as well as year nearing $1 billion for the year, $963 million US dollars as we continue to see very strong demand in that second line plus setting as well as very strong capacity expansion in the US, in Europe, and also with a contract manufacturer.\nSo we've talked before about that being more of a stair step rather than a direct linear line. It is performing very, very well. We're seeing nice continued expansion in Q1 of this year that will also continue throughout the year. For Tecvayli and Talvey, both products did well. We report sales or we break out sales on Tecvayli, we don't yet on Talvey. Both of these agents are best-in-class bispecifics; they're performing very well from a competitive share standpoint. We've got them nicely being utilized in the academic setting, and we're working that out into more of the community setting, which will be important for their continued growth and uptake.\nIn total, multiple myeloma really is a stronghold for us, and we're not stopping there. Because of the strength that we have, the assets that we have, we're also working on multiple additional types of combinations. John, maybe you want to address what we're doing with the bispecifics specifically.\n\nJohn Reed\n\nEVP of Innovative Medicine, R&D, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, thank you, Jennifer. Maybe before I jump in, I'll follow your lead and just offer my appreciation. Thanks to our colleagues, Innovative Medicine R&D, we had a heck of a year for the pipeline, 27 approvals, 49 submissions, 15 out of 17 positive phase IIIs, more than 90% success rate. Nine out of 12 POCs came in positive, exceeding the industry benchmarks by approximately double. Ten first in humans, 10 new NMEs added to the pipeline from internal research at a price point well below the industry median. And quite an impressive year on the BD front with five bolt-on acquisitions and six new molecules added to the pipeline.\nSo my congratulations to the team. Now on the point around our broad portfolio of myeloma medicines. This is where we are now bringing them together to reinvent the next frontline therapies.\nIf you were at the ASH Congress, the American Society of Hematology, you saw some of the early tantalizing data where in early lines of therapy in first, second line of myeloma, we're bringing DARA together with either Tecvayli or Talvey, and we've been getting 100% minimal residual disease negativity, MRD negativity, showing the impressive potential of these new combinations. Mind you, last year the FDA declared MRD minimal residual disease negativity or MRD as a surrogate endpoint within myeloma that could form the basis for accelerated approvals. So we're really excited about bringing these into earlier lines.\nAnd then I would also remind you with CARVYKTI, we are now doing studies in frontline transplant eligible and ineligible and asking whether we can replace autologous stem cell transplant with our CAR-T therapy as a new opportunity there to break through with, you know, unprecedented outcomes for patients. CARVYKTI, of course already is the go to regimen in the second line setting. The only CAR-T for myeloma approved in that setting. And last year we reported overall survival data for CARVYKTI in a randomized setting with an impressive hazard ratio of 0.55. So really feel great about bringing CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy as well.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nMaybe hot off the press, last night the team was very excited to come tell me. We've actually completed and reached our 5,000th patient infused with CARVYKTI across the clinical and commercial settings, and it is the most successful cell therapy launch in the industry.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask about the medical device or the sector. The business. Excuse me. Just the acquisition strategy. You've had a couple of pre-revenue swings with Laminar and V-Wave and some other more established businesses under the roof. Can you just talk about the strategy on a go-forward basis? I mean, is it going to continue to be a mix between pre-revenue companies and. more fully established businesses, or are you going to be, Is there going to be a shift in that strategy? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Josh. It's Joaquin, and good morning, everyone. External innovation has always been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy for Johnson & Johnson for the enterprise. In fact we are one of the top investors not only in M&A, but also in R&D. We are always looking for opportunities to be able to enhance our portfolio and our pipeline. In 2024 alone we completed more than 40 business development transactions.\nSome of them were big, some of them were small, but all of them complement both our Innovative and MedTech portfolio. Many of these smaller acquisitions were also in our MedTech portfolio.\nYou have to think that larger acquisitions like the case of Shockwave or in the innovative medicine side, Intra-Cellular, are more outliers. Our go-forward, it's always been focused on these smaller opportunities like the ones you mentioned, like Laminar or V-Wave or some of the ones we have completed, Innovative Medicine like Taris or our IL-23 blocker, which are more than $5 billion US dollars opportunities. That's where we are able to create value. Larger opportunities have to be seen more like outliers.\nAnd finally, I want to underline that both Abiomed and Shockwave Medical are progressing really well ahead of the deal model, delivering on our financial commitments there, and that we are looking forward, upon closure, to start with working on the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition too, which is an opportunity to reinforce our position of leadership in the neuroscience space, which has been always a strength of Johnson & Johnson, and also an opportunity overall to fortify revenue projections that you have looking today and also into the future. Thank you.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nJosh, maybe just building on Joaquin's comments relative to MedTech, while the big acquisitions get a lot of attention to Joaquin's point, we have a tremendous amount of business development activity across all of our businesses. I think most notably evidenced by almost 40 transactions just in 2024 alone. I did want to point to the excitement we have around the significant investments we've made both in Abiomed and Shockwave. Abiomed grew 15% for full year 2024, and we are seeing constant acceleration driven by firstly the tremendous portfolio we have.\nI think we could not be more excited about the DanGer Shock results, which really bring more validity to the evidence base around this portfolio. This is the first study in 20 years to actually demonstrate a survival benefit. In fact, a 12.7% mortality improvement versus the standard of care.\nWe also, while not a big commercial opportunity, received FDA approval in Q4 of last year for the use of Impella in pediatric community, which I think is just further evidence of the building confidence around the safety profile of this product. We also mentioned earlier that we are excited to be planning our submission for ECP to the FDA in the first half of this year.\nThis will, Josh, be the first and actually the smallest pump in the world. This is a 9 French insertion which expands to about 21 French inside the heart, a lower profile which we believe that will, along with its ease of use, reduce further barriers to adoption. And then finally, you know, a smaller transaction bBut certainly important to our goal to play a bigger role in heart failure is the acquisition of V-Wave which reinforces our commitment to building leadership in heart failure and really allows for the active shunting of blood across the interatrial septum. Quick couple comments on Shockwave.\nThat's our latest acquisition. We closed that in May of last year. This delivered $564 million of growth last year. It is the leading and first-to-market pioneer in IVL technology, and we're confident that while certainly there's a lot of excitement around this category, we have at least a five- to eight-year first-mover advantage. This comes down to the fact that we have an easy-to-use system with now six available catheters. We've also recently announced the addition of two additional catheters, our E8 catheter, which is our workhorse within peripheral, as well as Javelin, which is a novel non-balloon-based IVL catheter designed to modify calcium and cross extremely narrowed vessels.\nSo we feel enormously confident that, while big investments, they will make tremendous impact on patients and continue to drive our business. Thank you, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Alexandrra Hammond from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nDirector and Head of Therapeutics, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the Intra-Cellular deal last week. For Caplyta, how should we be thinking about the cadence of sales growth to the forecasted sales of $5 billion US dollars, and I guess on the acquisition, should we expect a deprioritization of seltorexant and aticaprant? Thank you so much.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGood morning. Thanks so much for the question. We are so excited to be able to welcome the Intra-Cellular colleagues to Johnson & Johnson. They have done such an extraordinary job both in developing Caplyta and their pipeline, but also commercializing and bringing Caplyta to patients currently for schizophrenia as well as for Bipolar I and Bipolar II depression. I think you can take a look at their current sales trajectory, which is a really nice growth curve. Then also take into account the filing that has been done for MDD, major depressive Disorder, the filing that's been done with the regulatory authorities that we anticipate approval for later in the year.\nMDD, we believe to ultimately be the largest of those three indications for Caplyta, and so we think that that will be an additional catalyst for growth. You can factor that into your thinking. We're really excited about Caplyta. I know the company had guided to it being a $5 billion+ asset. We definitely think that it will be as well and think that together we're going to be able to do even more for patients with mental health issues. We're also really excited about their pipeline and 1284 and potential in Alzheimer's, psychosis, general anxiety disorder, and others. So we see Intra-Cellular as both a near term as well as long-term growth catalyst for us.\n\nJohn Reed\n\nEVP of Innovative Medicine, R&D, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah. About your question though, around whether we'll prioritize other things in the portfolio? Absolutely not. Let me just remind everyone that depression is a very heterogeneous disorder, and it's not a disease that accommodates a one-size-fits-all. We see each of these molecules that we're developing having unique mechanisms that can play in different subpopulations, and we're developing those aticaprant, seltorexant, for example, using a precision neuroscience strategy. So we see this broad portfolio, which includes, of course, Spravato, as a repertoire of different mechanisms we can bring to bear.\nThere are 260 million people worldwide that suffer from chronic depression. It's the leading cause of disability, and more than 30% of those do not get relief from the ongoing medicines.\nThe other thing that I really like about our portfolio is the side effect profiles are so benign compared to the standard of care with all four of the mechanisms, whether it's Caplyta, which we hope to welcome into the portfolio, whether it's aticaprant, seltorexant, or Spravato. You don't have weight gain, you don't have sexual dysfunction, you don't have the tardive dyskinesia or extrapyramidal effects that are so common with many of the medicines today. So this is really exciting for us. Maybe. Also, while I am talking about our depression portfolio, I would just acknowledge and congratulate the team on the recent approval of Spravato in the monotherapy context.\nThis indeed allows us to offer Spravato as a solution for patients with treatment-resistant depression without necessity to use it on top of standard of care, and therefore avoiding those side effects that I just mentioned that the standard care medicines often bring. Very excited about that approval. We had received priority review from the FDA for that submission. That's the second time Spravato had received a priority review. The only antidepressant ever to do so. Spravato is also the only antidepressant to ever receive breakthrough designation from the FDA. So great momentum and a long-term commitment to patients suffering with depression.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much. I have a question on Immunology franchise and Tremfya. So with Stelara facing biosimilars, I'm wondering if it might play out like how it has with AbbVie. So in the case of AbbVie, they said that biosimilar Humira has actually driven a volume shift in favor of other brands like Skyrizi. I'm wondering if you expect that could occur with Tremfya on the volume side and then on the price side. Can you talk about incremental price erosion in 2025 to maintain access relative to whatever the price erosion was in 2024?\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson",
    "content2": "Thank you very much for the question. We're really excited about the great progress that we're making with Tremfya in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but really particularly with inflammatory bowel diseases coming up with the launch in ulcerative colitis now and Crohn's upcoming. We've guided, you know, maybe just back on Stelara. We've talked about the Humira erosion curve being probably the best thing to model. Specific to your question about should there or will there be patient switches, I think there are a lot of patients in the immunology market right now that are in need of both advanced therapies or are in need of better therapies than they're on now.\nAnd so we do see across the board shifting of patients and movement into the newer and the better products. I would put Tremfya squarely in that camp. We've got lots of reasons. If we focus in on IBD and the potential growth for Tremfya, we've got a lot of reasons for great optimism there. And differentiation, it's the only dual acting IL-23 agent, and IBD acts on both IL-23 as well as CD64. We think it's got the potential to really set the next bar in efficacy. And we know there are a lot of patients who need more and are ready for switch. And we think with our sub-Q induction dose, we're going to have unrivaled flexibility.\nSo you know the ability for fully sub-Q induction and maintenance as well as the opportunity for IV. So the launch right now is going very well in UC, and we're very excited and optimistic. Really looking forward to the upcoming launch in Crohn's in sub-Q. And we've invested appropriately. Last part of the question, I think was on pricing.\nWe've invested appropriately to make sure that we've got the right access for patients with Tremfya so that as we launch, we've got the ability when prescribers want to write for patients, we've got the access to be able to do so. And we're seeing that right now with very strong frontline commercial coverage for Tremfya in UC as well as a permanent J code. So. So that is in and sort of factored into what we're seeing now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, Tim. How are you thinking about the growth of the MedTech market in 2025 and J&J relative to the market, and what are you assuming for the EP business and VARIPULSE? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Larry, and appreciate your continued interest in our business. Let me start with the market, Larry. We communicated at the Enterprise Business Review that we saw our end markets growing roughly 5% to 7 as we look at procedures within the year to come. We believe that they have for the most part normalized. You will recall that in the first half of last year we expected some tailwinds on the back of clearing of the backlog, specifically in orthopedic procedures. We believe that for the most part around the world procedures have normalized to pre-COVID levels and we expect the same as we now move into 2025.\nSpecific to electrophysiology. I did want to firstly acknowledge that out of an abundance of caution, we recently announced a temporary pause of all US VARIPULSE cases while we investigate the root cause of four reported neurovascular events.\nAnd you know, Larry, while disappointing, this is an easy decision for us aligned to our credo. Patient safety is always an absolute priority for us. And frankly, given that we are collaborating now with the FDA on this matter, this is all we will be sharing at this time. We will proactively provide further updates when we have additional information to share. I do however, think it's important to remind everyone that this announcement is specific to the US and there's no international expected impact to VARIPULSE cases outside of the US where the rollout of the technology has been successful with approximately 3,000 commercial cases completed.\nI do think it's important to reinforce that, you know, while we are facing a headwind today, we have tremendous opportunity in the electrophysiology space. It's an exciting market, as you know, with relatively low global penetration, well under five, as you know, and an expanding market size due to aging populations. Today we have a $5 billion market leading position in electrophysiology which grew 14% in 2024, driven by commercial execution and a significant portfolio of new product introductions from QDOT to Ultrasound CARTO and more recently VARIPULSE, partially offset by competitive PFA pressures, most notably here in the US.\nNow we've been market leader, as you know, Larry, for 20 years and have an entrenched footprint with an installed base of over 5,000 CARTO systems, which is widely recognized as the benchmark in mapping software and a broad network of highly trained mappers. Building on our success in navigation catheters and RF ablation in 2024, we launched our first PFA catheter VARIPULSE with strong initial feedback in Europe, Japan, and Canada.\nAdditionally, similar to our success in our RF portfolio, we are expanding beyond that, and we recently announced EU approval of the dual energy STSF catheter, which is modeled on the RF STSF catheter, which historically is the most widely used ablation catheter in the world. We're also building on this and working on our OmniPulse Large Tip Focal Catheter, demonstrating our commitment to bring to market a comprehensive portfolio in PFA. So I will also say, Larry, it's not just in EP; we're also moving beyond AFib, and we're working to enter the left atrial appendage closure market through the acquisition of Laminar, which we announced in Q4 2023.\nIn summary, Larry, while we're facing short-term headwinds, as you know, especially here in the US, we are absolutely confident in our ability to retain our global market leadership position over the long term. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks so much. I just had a two-parter on operating margins. I think you mentioned in the remarks about 150 basis points of improvement this year in R&D. Can you just elaborate a little bit more and what's enabling that despite the lower top line growth and some of the negative product mix from Stelara? I guess I'm trying to get at, should we be expecting OpEx to be down this year embedded in that guide. And the second part was just beyond this year.\nJust help us think about the cadence of margin expansion as we think about 2026 and beyond and top line reaccelerates. Thank you.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Chris. With respect to the 150 basis improvement that wasn't related to year-on-year comparison from the R&D, I would say that's really part and parcel to what we've been doing for a couple years now. When we had a chance to separate the consumer health business out into its own company, we did take a look at the corporate infrastructure, and as you know, we also prioritized our investments in innovative medicine and MedTech specifically within those portfolios as well.\nSo we came much more focused, and you're starting to see the culmination of that this year. You might have noticed in MedTech last year we did have some restructuring charges related to some orthopedic moves that we made getting out of certain markets that were less profitable, improving our infrastructure around manufacturing. Those are starting to come home to roost, so to speak, in Innovative Medicine obviously prioritizing most of our investment into what I would call our thoroughbreds within the stable.\nSo oncology, immunology, neuroscience as you can tell. And you know we have invested in technology over the last few years in a pretty significant way. There's still more investment to come, but that's starting to yield some benefits as well in terms of efficiency around the organization. So you know we knew for a few years, years now that Stelara would face biosimilar competition, and so we had to be prepared. And this is kind of how the organization has gone about it.\nAs far as 2026 and beyond, I think, you know, I'd go back to the comments I made with respect to operating margin and probably EPS growth overall, that that will be commensurate with sales. So that should be a positive outlook.\nAs you know, this year we're calling for 3% operational growth despite multibillion-dollar headwinds. Most organizations would be looking to contract both, probably top and bottom line. Here we are growing 3% on the top line operationally and about 9% on the bottom line. I think you could look for maybe a little bit better equilibrium in 2026 and beyond, but with an expectation that we'd have some higher sales growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live. Perhaps your phone is on mute. Matt. Matt, your line is now live. Our next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live. Pardon me. Just make sure you hear my audio.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThe next analyst please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning, everybody. On behalf of [Christian] and myself, I wanted to come back to just the overall MedTech strategy and appreciate that you exited the year over the 7% number that you had previously communicated as the high end of the range. But when you pick that apart a little bit, clearly a big percentage of that does come from M&A, I think with ex M&A, the organic number being below the 5% to 7.\nSo can you maybe just walk through a little bit how you think about the organic investment in the business versus inorganic contribution to that number long term, especially when you start to look at some of the more established franchises of that, surgery, orthopedics, that.\nYour end market. Then if I could just speak an accounting one-liner in here, just want to confirm there is no revenue recognition reversal charges in the EP numbers this quarter for VARIPULSE.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nDavid, thank you for the question. You know we could not be more thrilled with the performance that we delivered in 2024. While there are opportunities, you know we delivered almost $32 billion of sales at an operational growth rate of 6.2%. When you take out the impact of Shockwave, that's 4.7%. Let me be very clear that we remain very confident in our expectations communicated at the EBR.\nAs a reminder, we expect our end markets to grow between 5% and 7% on a weighted average basis between 2022 and 2027. We expect to deliver an operational CAGR in the upper end of the range over that period. In 2024, 6.2% as I mentioned. We're pleased with the continued double-digit growth in cardiovascular both within our core electrophysiology business and our new acquisitions in Abiomed and Shockwave, which I referenced earlier.\nWe're also proud of the continuous improvements in Ortho. This is a business that historically was a laggard from MedTech but tremendous improvements especially with the mid-single-digit growth in hips and knees and continued innovation with our enabling technologies and specifically in VELYS. We're also encouraged by the continuous improvements in vision, another core business.\nAs you know, we had a slower start to 2024, but we saw that improve throughout the year culminating in an operational growth rate in the Q4 of 9.1%. That said, as you know too well, we do have some short-term headwinds, near-term competitive pressures in US EP as one, and secondly, continued headwinds in China which we've mentioned in 2025 will continue to be a headwind, and we have included that in our estimates as we look to the year ahead.\nWe don't provide guidance by sector, as you know, but we're confident that continued growth will be driven by our tremendous portfolio of new products, specifically VARIPULSE, our TECNIS Premium IOLs, ACUVUE OASYS MAX in contact lens, VELYS portfolio in ortho, our Stratafix portfolio in barbed sutures, and our broad-based hemostats in surgery.\nWe also believe that our recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, as I mentioned earlier, will continue to perform exceptionally well, fueled by multiple new products, new indications, and a rapidly growing body of clinical evidence. I will say that it's important as you think about 2025 to recognize, as Joe mentioned earlier, that we expect to see an acceleration in the back half. We are seeing some tough comparators. When we compare to 2024, a couple of factors will be positive.\nOne-time change in revenue recognition in our Ortho business, inventory builds outside of the US in electrophysiology, and finally headwinds related to selling days versus prior year. So we would recommend that we encourage you to consider these in your statements for the year ahead.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nMaybe, David, just to cap off, you asked a specific question around accounting reversal and whether that had any impact on the quarter. There was none related to VARIPULSE.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks David. Thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. I'll now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you. Thank you, Jess. Thank you everyone for joining the call today. As you have heard, we are ready for 2025, a year that will solidify our strengths and lead to elevated performance for the balance of the decade. Enjoy the rest of the day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Q4 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."

All participants will be in a listen only mode until the question and answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. If you've experienced technical difficulties during the conference, you may press star zero to reach the operator. Now I'd like to turn the conference Johnson & Johnson. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHello, everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson welcome to our company's review of the second quarter business results and our full year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.j&j.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.j&j. com and on the SEC's website.\n\nAdditionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will start by reviewing the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation, as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2024. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, who will then provide some closing remarks before we open it up for questions. Jennifer Taubert, John Reed, and Tim Schmid, our Innovative Medicine in MedTech Leaders will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson.\n\nFurthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Turning to our second quarter sales results. Worldwide sales were $22.4 billion for the second quarter of 2024. Sales increased 6.6% with growth of 7.8% in the U.S. and 5.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, sales growth was 7.2% worldwide and growth of 6.4% outside of the U.S. Sales growth in Europe, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, was 6%. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.05 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.82, representing increases of 1.6% and 10.2%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2023. I'll comment on business sales performance in the quarter.\n\nBeginning with innovative medicine, worldwide innovative medicines sales of $14.5 billion increased 7.8% with growth of 8.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.8% worldwide, and 8.7% outside of the U.S. Innovative medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products with 10 assets delivering double digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 21.3%, primarily driven by share gains of 4.6 points across all lines of therapy and 9.4 points in the frontline setting, as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $186 million with growth of 59.9% driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies and strong demand.\n\nTECVAYLI sales achieved $135 million in the quarter with growth of 43.5%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. Demand remains strong while sequential growth slowed due to adoption of recently approved longer duration dosing intervals. EARLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 32.5%, primarily driven by share gains and market growth in metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer. Other oncology growth was driven by continued strong uptake of TALVEY, our GPRC5D bispecific and RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non small cell lung cancer. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 30.7% driven by market growth, share gains, and PSO and PSA, and favorable patient mix. STELARA growth of 4.9% was driven by market growth, partially offset by net unfavorable patient mix. We continue to anticipate Biosimilar entry in Europe later this month, while in the U.S., we expect continued volume growth largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry in 2025. In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 60.8% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient confidence.\n\nIn pulmonary hypertension, OPSUMIT grew 9.1% due to share gains and market growth, partially offset by unfavorable mix. UPTRAVI growth of 8.1% was driven by market growth and share gains, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Total innovative medicine sales growth was partially offset by a decline in other neuroscience, unfavorable patient mix in [inaudible], and competitive pressures in IMBRUVICA. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $8 billion increased 4.4% with growth in the U.S. of 5.7% and 3.2% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a positive impact of 40 basis points on sales growth in the quarter. Growth was driven by commercial execution, strength of new product introductions, and continued strong procedure volume, partially offset by performance in China and competitive pressures in U.S. distributor stocking dynamics in vision. In cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered double digit growth of 13.4% with strong growth across all regions. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution, partially offset by the previous one-time inventory build in Asia Pacific from the prior quarter. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15.4%, driven by double digit growth in all regions, and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology.\n\nResults include $77 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave, which closed on may 31st. Contact lenses adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the blank divestiture, was 2.1%, growth was driven by strong performance and ACUVUE OASYS one-day family of products, partially offset by U.S. distributor, stocking dynamics and competitive pressures, and Japan macroeconomic pressure. The blank divestiture negatively impacted growth by approximately 130 basis points. Surgical vision grew 1.2% driven by TECNIS EYHANCE, our mono focal intraocular lens, partially offset by China VDP and refractive softness in the U.S. Surgery adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the [inaudible] divestiture was approximately flat. Performance was driven primarily by competitive pressures in energy and endo cutters, China VDP, prior yea, China recovery, EMEA tender timing across advanced surgery, and supply constraints and wound closure. This was partially offset by strength of new products. The [inaudible] divestiture negatively impacted growth by approximately 110 basis points. Orthopedics growth of 3.3% was driven by strong performance in hips and knees due to procedure growth, strength of new products, and EMEA tender timing in knees. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures and impacts of China VDP in spine and sports.\n\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold margin deleveraged by 60 basis points, primarily driven by product mix within innovative medicine and macroeconomic factors across both sectors. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels investing $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.7 billion or 18.8% of sales and innovative medicine compared to 22.2% of sales in 2023. As a reminder, last year included an upfront payment of $245 million associated with the [inaudible] partnership. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.7 billion, or 9% of sales, an increase driven by continued investment in strategic platforms. Other income and expense was a net expense of $653 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to income of $384 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in expense was primarily driven by costs related to the closing of the Shockwave acquisition, the loss on the completion of the debt for equity exchange of the retained stake in [inaudible] and prior year favorable intellectual property litigation settlements in MedTech.\n\nThis was partially offset by the gaining on the [inaudible] divestiture. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 18.5% versus 14.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by unfavorable one-time international audit settlements and the continued impact from Pillar 2. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 18.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2024, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, as a percentage of sales, increased from 37.2% to 37.4%. Innovative medicines margin improved from 42.3% to 44.6%, primarily driven by an upfront payment of $245 million associated with the [inaudible] partnership in 2023, partially offset by product mix and cost of products sold. MedTech margin declined from 28.2% to 25.7% driven by prior year favorable intellectual property litigation settlement worth approximately 300 basis points. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jessica, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Overall, Johnson & Johnson delivered solid top and bottom line as well as free cash flow growth in the quarter. Our innovative medicine business made great progress in the second quarter, we have strong momentum with key end market products and continue to advance our pipeline with significant clinical and regulatory milestones being attained. Our MedTech business delivered growth of fell below our expectations of growing in the upper range of our markets, which as you recall correlates to a weighted average market growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2022 through 2027. We came into the year thinking 2024 would be in the upper end of that range with acceleration planned in the second half, given some of the first half dynamics Jessica outlined, we now expect growth closer to 6% for 2024. To me, this reflects the power and breadth of our company, where we can more than offset quarterly volatility in one part with over performance from another part of our business.\n\nBefore I get into the numbers, I'd like to provide some qualitative business highlights from the quarter. Starting with innovative medicine, in oncology, we continue to make meaningful progress across our disease areas of focus. Of note, we received FDA approval for CARVIKTY in earlier lines of therapy and reported positive topline overall survival results from the CARTITUDE-4 study. We also submitted a filing with the FDA for a subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT. We presented updated results for TAR-200, and TAR-210. We met primary endpoints for two doors like studies, [inaudible] and AQUILA where results will be presented in an upcoming major medical meeting. Turning to immunology, we achieved key milestones for TREMFYA and inflammatory bowel disease, including the presentation and filing of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. As well as the filing of our subcutaneous formulation, which would make TREMFYA the only IL23 inhibitor with a fully subcutaneous regimen. We also expanded our immunology portfolio with the acquisitions of Proteologix and NM26. These bispecific antibodies will further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our ability to address significant unmet need in atopic dermatitis.\n\nFinally, spanning immunology and neuroscience, we presented positive results for nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease and myasthenia gravis. But it doesn't stop with the second quarter, we are excited for what awaits in the second half of this year with the anticipated approval and launch of both RYBREVANT, plus lazertinib and frontline EGFR positive lung cancer, and TREMFYA in IBD. We also expect data from J&J2113, a targeted oral peptide in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, J&J4804 our co-antibody therapeutic in IBD and nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. As we continue to bring new innovations to market and execute against our clinical and regulatory milestones, innovative medicine is well positioned to achieve sustainable growth in both the near and long term. Turning to MedTech, we continue to advance our pipeline, launched new commercial products and integrate strategic acquisitions that broaden and further differentiate our portfolio. In cardiovascular we are enhancing our portfolio and shifting into higher growth markets through strategic acquisitions, such as Shockwave Medical. In May, we announced the launch of our CARTO 3 version 8 electoral anatomical mapping system. This is the latest version of our 3D heart mapping system, which has machine learning capabilities that increase efficiency, reproducibility, and accuracy and maps electrophysiologist used to treat atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. In pulse field ablation, we initiated the commercial launch of the viral pulse platform in the EU and Japan, receiving early positive physician feedback in the external evaluation period.\n\nWe also delivered results from the pivotal Phase of the admire trial, where the [inaudible] pulse platform demonstrated 85% peak primary effectiveness with minimal adverse events, short PSA application times, and low fluoroscopy exposure. In Orthopedics, we received five 10-K FDA clearance for the clinical application of the Dallas robotic assisted solution and unique compartmental knee arthroplasty. This is designed for both medial and lateral procedures, enabling surgeons to guide precise implant placement without a CT scan. In surgery, we launched the Echelon 3000 in the U.S., which combines 3D stapling and gripping surface technology to enable greater staple line security. This has been shown to deliver 47% fewer leaks, reduce surgical risks, and improve surgical outcomes. In surgical vision, we launched TECNIS EYHANCE in the U.S. and head into a full market launch in the second half of 2024. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology and cardiovascular pipelines as we prepare for the anticipated U.S. approval of [inaudible], as well as the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. Within robotic surgery, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Ottava in the second half of the year.\n\nBefore turning to cash flow and guidance, I wanted to provide an update on the talc litigation. As announced on May 1st, the company has committed to pay over an [inaudible] are present value of approximately $6.5 billion or $8 billion nominally over 25 years ,resolving 99.75% of all pending talc law suits against the company and its affiliates in the United States. We are currently in a voting period for the plan, where for the first time, claimants are able to vote for themselves for or against the plan. The last day of voting is scheduled for July 26th. It will then take a few weeks for the vote administrator to vet and tally the votes. Once that process concludes, we plan to make a public announcement on the next steps regarding a pre packaged bankruptcy filing. Our confidence that we will reach the requisite 75% vote is bolstered by the continued support of counsel representing the vast majority of claimants with whom the plan was developed, as well as the announcements of support by additional prominent plaintiff law firms recently, including [inaudible] Stock, [inaudible] and Miller. Additionally, in furtherance of our goal of achieving a comprehensive solution, we finalized the previously announced agreements reached with all states that advanced health claims in the Emirates and Cypress entities, owners of the minds that supplied talc to the company. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress with mesothelioma claimants with 95% of claimants now settled.\n\nTurning to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $41 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Free cash flow year to date was approximately $7.5 billion compared to $5.5 billion in the prior year period, which included cash flow from the consumer health business. During the quarter, we exited our retained stake in [inaudible], bringing the separation to a close. The net proceeds from the secondary offering with $3.6 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, we maintain a strong balance sheet, which continues to enable us to strategically invest in and grow our business, while returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. In the second quarter, we invested more than $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales and research and development. In terms of acquisitions and licensing, during the first half of 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $17 billion in strategic value, creating inorganic growth opportunities. This includes Shockwave, Proteologix, and the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction announced last week, as well as more than 20 other smaller complementary business development transactions. We will always explore strategic deals of any size that can create value, we foresee modest tuck in deals as the preferred route over the near term.\n\nNow turning to our full year 2024 guidance given the moving parts associated with the acquisitions this quarter I'll start where I, usually end up with earnings per share. Before the impact of recent acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again being increased is this schedule reflects we are expecting a five cent per share increase in our operational performance. This would result in year over year EPS growth of eight 2% at the midpoint. To account for the completion of Shockwave, Protium, and the N M twenty-six bi specific antibody transactions and as previously disclosed our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of 68 per share. Combined all of this yielded an updated adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of $10 to $10.10 per share. In addition to assist with your future models. These transactions are expected to have a smaller impact of 33 cents to adjusted operational EPS in 2025. Now to address all elements of P&L guidance for 2024 as a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full year by $500 million to reflect the completion of the Shockwave acquisition. We now expect growth in the range of six 1% to six 6% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $89 $4 billion or six 4% at the midpoint.\n\nExcluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 5.5% to 6.0% compared to 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. We are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.08, consistent with last quarter. However, there have been notable strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, specifically the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. As a result, we estimate an incremental negative foreign currency impact of $500 million, resulting in a full-year impact of $1.2 billion. As such, combined with the Shockwave acquisition, we expect reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2%, compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% growth. Turning to the rest of the P&L. Based solely on the dilution from the transactions, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by 120 basis points, more than offsetting the previously communicated 50 basis point improvement. We projected net interest income between $300 million and $400 million, lower than previous guidance driven by interest expense associated with financing of our recent acquisitions. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, an increase versus previous guidance driven by year-to-date performance.\n\nOur effective tax rate is now expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full-year, much higher than 2023, largely due to the impact of OECD Pillar 2, as well as the non-deductible nature of the recently announced NM26 bispecific antibody acquisition. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. We continue to expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe beginning the last week of July. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. While we had COVID-19 vaccine sales in the second quarter, we do not anticipate any future sales. Finally, it is worth noting that distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in the fourth quarter. In preparation for this transfer, we expect limited third-quarter sales in Europe. Turning to Med Tech, as previously stated, we expect growth to accelerate back in line with our long-term expectations in the second-half of the year. This will be driven by recovery in contact lenses, evidenced by sequential monthly improvement within Q2. Further expansion into high-growth segments, including the integration of Shockwave and continued growth of new products and commercial execution across the portfolio.\n\nAs you think about our adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect it to be higher in the first-half of the year, compared to the second-half. Again, this is due to the IP R&D charge for the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction in Q3 as well as the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe later this month. Lastly, as a reminder on share count, we only expect a partial benefit in the third quarter resulting from the share count reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer in August of 2023 with the fourth quarter being neutral. As we move forward, we remain focused on advancing our differentiated portfolio and achieving key clinical and regulatory milestones across Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained growth and long-term value for patients, customers, and shareholders. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin for concluding remarks before taking your questions.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nExecutive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman-Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. With a strong second quarter, I'm excited about the rest of 2024. Our Innovative Medicine business is on track for a 13th consecutive year of above-market growth. Our success is driven by a portfolio of innovative best and first-in-class medicines, many of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Across the board, oncology, immunology, neuroscience, we are reinventing treatment paradigms and transforming lives. As Joe mentioned, we have made significant progress across our pipeline. In particular, I would like to highlight two major milestones on the horizon that will help drive sustained growth through 2025 and beyond. First, the approval and launch of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib for first-line treatment of EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And second, the approval and launch of TREMFYA in Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD, which follows the recent presentation of data that demonstrated superiority versus STELARA.\n\nThis represents a meaningful opportunity for TREMFYA as approximately 75% of STELARA sales today come from IBD. We also have regulatory and data milestones for many of the assets that we expect to generate more than $5 billion in peak year sales. As the pipeline and portfolio progress, so too does our confidence in our near and long-term growth trajectory. We are confident in our ability to grow through the upcoming STELARA biosimilar entry and see accelerating momentum through the back half of the decade. In MedTech, year-to-date adjusted operational sales growth of 5.2% reflects continued progress with the portfolio as we move into higher growth markets. As you heard from Joe, we expect MedTech growth to accelerate in the second-half of the year. Growth will accelerate through continued expansion of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS Max 1-Day Contact Lenses, TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and VARIPULSE in Europe and Japan.\n\nOur confidence in the business outlook remains unchanged. With meaningful outcomes from the danger shock trial in Abiomed and the second quarter close of the Shockwave acquisition, we look forward to continue the expansion into high-growth MedTech markets. As you know, Johnson & Johnson is laser-focused on advancing the next wave of medical innovation. We are building on a strong foundation to unlock accelerated growth with a healthy balance sheet and industry-leading investments in the best science and innovation. This enables us to move into the second-half of 2024 from a position of strength. With that, let's open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you like to ask a question at this time, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit your questions to one question only. Our first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nGreat. Thanks so much [inaudible] question. Maybe just a question on RYBREVANT. I know, Joaquin, you mentioned that as one of the key upcoming milestones for the company, but this does seem like a product where there's a disconnect between J&J's enthusiasm in the Street. So, maybe just enlighten us with some of the data we recently saw at ASCO on subcutaneous dosing, et cetera, the upcoming label expansion? Can you just talk about how you see RYBREVANT evolving overtime and your confidence that this product can take share in the frontline setting? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nExecutive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman-Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHi, Chris, it's Jennifer and thanks so much for the question. Real quick before I get into that one, I just wanted to give a quick shout-out to all my internal Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for a terrific quarter. Our first $14 billion-plus quarter that we hit in over 10 products with double-digit growth. So, really, really a tremendous quarter and looking-forward to a great half of the year as well. So, we are very excited about RYBREVANT plus lazertinib and the data that we're seeing and really believe that it's going to have a significant place in frontline non-small cell lung cancer. As we've discussed before, there is a significant unmet need in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with about a quarter of patients never even making it to second-line therapy. So, a lot of patients that are there with high unmet medical need. When we take a look at the data that we've been able to generate in terms of PFS and when you add to that, the new data that we brought forward on our subcu dosing, we think together, we're going to have a really winning combination for patients in that frontline setting. So, high unmet need, really spectacular results that we're seeing and the subcu dosing we think is going to be a great combination.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, maybe we can do a deeper dive into MedTech. Just talk about what drove the reduction in the expected growth for MedTech in 2024? And how are you thinking about the Medtech end-markets in the second half and which J&J businesses do you see improving in the second-half and why? Thank you.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nLarry, thank you for the question. Let me be very clear, we remain absolutely committed to delivering solid growth in the full-year for 2024. And Larry, when you actually look at ‘24 Q2, it was a tougher quarter for us. And we knew this, given the fact that at this time last year around the second quarter, we saw the opening up of the China market, which as you know is an important market for us and that was expected. That was actually by the way, last year our fastest-growing quarter. Now in all transparency, as you heard initially in the comments earlier, there have been two businesses that have or two areas of our business that have performed below expectations. Number one is Vision and secondly, our performance in China, which right now is a very volatile market. Now in Vision, we initially announced in the first quarter some challenges with distributor stocking dynamics here in the U.S., some competitive pressures, as well as some macroeconomic challenges in Japan.\n\nWhat gives me confidence in the turnaround of that business is that we actually saw sequential improvement through the second quarter. Some of those stocking dynamic dynamics I mentioned bled into April, but month-on-month, we saw strong rebound of that business, in fact, to the end of the quarter back to historical levels. And so as we look to the back half of the year, while it's been a slower start there, we're very confident that we're going to be able to bring that business back to historical norms, driven primarily by innovation. Our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX portfolio and that global launch as well as the addition of our premium IOLs with TECNIS PureSee in Asia-Pac and EMEA as well as Odyssey here in the U.S., and so we believe we've got that under control. When I look to the back half onto answer your question more directly, the reason we are confident is firstly, not only the return to more normalized growth within Vision, but in surgery, by the way, that--all that business also was impacted by a slower start, especially in China. We see that starting to normalize. And also remember in our surgery business, the results were impacted by the divestiture of a Acclarent last year. And so normalized growth--our adjusted operational growth was actually closer to flat. We see that continuing to grow at low-single-digit through the back half of the year. We're proud of the solid results in ortho and see that continuing to be driven by strong results within hip 6%, in knees, almost 10%, driven by tremendous innovation, especially in VELYS.\n\nAnd then more broadly, I'll end with our real confidence in the growth of our cardiovascular portfolio. And remember, Larry, that we've got an EP business that's $5 billion today, grew 21% last year, 19% for the first-half of the year. In fact, in the second quarter, in the face of competition, here in the U.S. we grew that business 16%. And so we're very confident in our ability to grow that leadership position. And then finally, the addition of Abiomed still continuing to grow ahead of our deal expectations, 15.4%. I think that's going to be bolstered by the landmark results, the first time in 25 years, where we have the DanGer Shock study showing survivability benefits of Impella, which will continue to open new markets for that portfolio. And then finally, I'll end with how delighted we are to inch very, very short order, welcome Shockwave to Johnson & Johnson. We closed that transaction in record timing and are really excited by the fact that we will shortly announce that they will be the 13th business with sales in excess of $1 billion annually. And so for all those reasons, Larry, while a tougher second year--second quarter primarily due to comps, we remain very confident in a solid 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald Securities\n\nHi, thank you for taking my question. Wanted to ask you about your Phase III nipocalimab data that you presented recently. And how do you compare and contrast the efficacy and durability of your product versus other FCRNs and mechanisms of actions on the market? Thank you.\n\nJohn C. Reed\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development, Sanofi\n\nYes, John Reed here. Thanks for that question. Well, we're really excited about the data in Sjogren's with nipocalimab. It's the data we delivered shows really sustained disease control, which is so important by our dosing regimen as compared to some of the intermittent dosing regimens used by others. And the consistent efficacy we've seen across all primary, secondary endpoints, et cetera is really compelling as a guess that we may be on the first advanced therapy for Sjogren's that disease has ever seen. As you know, that's a very prevalent disorder affecting its estimated 4 million people around the world, perhaps 1 million in the United States, 90% of the people impacted are women right in the prime of life. So, we're really excited about the possibility of bringing forward the first advanced therapy for that disorder.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nMaybe I can add-in a couple of things on as well because we're really excited by what we're seeing from all the data that's coming out. And over the last 18 months, we've demonstrated clinical effect in actually four auto-antibody driven diseases and we are the only FCRN blocker that's in development where we've got proof-of-concept in all three segments of auto-antibody driven diseases from rare auto-antibody to prevalent room to maternal fetal. So as we take a look at all the data that's coming forward as we're bringing this to market, we are even more confident--in terms of confidence that this is a $5 billion-plus asset for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is now live.\n\nRick Wise\n\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everybody. If I could talk a little bit about the EP business. Obviously, this is the first full quarter where we're really seeing a broader launch of a competitive PFA system. You updated us on your system. But maybe if you could give us more color broadly on the impact you're seeing on EP growth and the outlook for the second-half, and help us better understand how this launch and the lot of CARTO 3 version 8 launch is being affected here. I’m assuming mapping growth was strong, but maybe--I don't know, maybe the catheter business was pressured by the competitive system. Can you help give us that macro color and maybe the specific impact on Biosense Webster. Thank you.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nOf course, Rick and thank you for the question. And Rick, I'd start with firstly, recognizing that we believe that PFA is really good for electrophysiology and really good for patients. It is a tailwind for the entire market. And as I mentioned earlier, that's a $5 billion market for us today, growing 19% year-to-date. And let me be clear, we clearly see some competition, especially here in the U.S., especially between now and the time that we bring our PFA technology to market, we're confident. While we don't control the timing, we expect to have that by the end of the year or early next year. As you know, we already have and are commercializing our PFA technology in EMEA and in Japan, and we are very fortunate to actually benefit from a very global EP business. What gives us confidence in the future, Larry, is that we believe that while PFA has a role to play in the portfolio, so does RF. From everything we're hearing from EPs around the world, what they like about PFA is the relative safety of the technology, but they also like about RF, which by the way, we have 20-years of leadership in safety and clinical efficacy, is the durability of that product. In fact, even today, Rick, here in the U.S., for every five procedures where PFA is used, RF is used in conjunction.\n\nAnd so, we believe that leisure position that we built over the last 20-years will continue, both in RF and then obviously, we're excited by the launch of our PFA technology. You'll know that at the HRS conference in May, we announced the results of our admIRE study, which showed the 86% relative effectiveness--primary effectiveness of our PFA technology. And we are going to continue to employ the same strategy we did in RF, which is building out a broad portfolio of PFA offerings, both in dual energy, focal, large focal and single shot. Did you know that today, the number one used catheter on the market is our SPF catheter within RF. And we are--and you'll know that in the second--first quarter of this year, we announced a application for a CE mark for our dual energy catheter. This will be one catheter used, both for RF and PFA technology. And so, we've got a lot of reasons to believe. And I think to touch on your point on CARTO, one of the benefit of our portfolios, not just our energy source and catheters, it really is the installed base of 5,500 CARTO systems around the world. We just version 8 of that software. It is best-in-class in the market. And that's also complemented by highly trained clinical specialists in every cath lab around the world who are supporting EPs each and every day. And so once again, PFA is a good thing for the marketplace, it's a tailwind and we expect to continue to benefit on that. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nTerence C. Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Two parts for me on IRA. Was just wondering if you can offer any perspective on the impact of IRA negotiation STELARA and XARELTO as we're getting close to the disclosure of the pricing decision? And then also Part D redesign in 2025, just some high-level thoughts? And the second part of the question relates to your confidence that DARZALEX FASPRO will be looked at separately than DARZALEX just given the Hyaluronidase component there. Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nExecutive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman-Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks so much for the question. I'll answer the second part first. We do have very good confidence that DARZALEX FASPRO is treated separately than DARZALEX IV. And so yes, we continue forward with that strong perspective on that. In terms of IRA and kind of what's been going on, if we take a look at Part D redesign, while we're not externally quantifying the impact at this time, what we can say is that we do anticipate a net unfavorable impact in 2025. However, as outlined at our enterprise business review last November, we do anticipate, as a business, growing 3% plus next year and then 5% to 7% out through 2030. And these numbers are actually already included in that guidance that we provided. Same thing as it pertains to the government price setting process, we are still in that. We have received the final numbers from the government, we're not disclosing that at this time. That will be disclosed in the September time frame. And while we are not in alignment with IRA and the price setting process, those numbers have been included in the guidance that we provided last year at EBR, that still looks very good to us today. It's very consistent today.\n\nJohn C. Reed\n\nExecutive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development, Sanofi\n\nSince you mentioned, DARZALEX. John Reed here, I thought maybe I would just remind you that actually, in this quarter, we delivered four additional positive Phase III studies with DARZALEX across a number of indications, including transplant ineligible frontline, including in the maintenance setting, after transplant, including smoldering condition that is as large as the entirety of diagnostically defying myeloma and in amyloidosis. So, the momentum continues with DARZALEX.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nExecutive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman-Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson\n\nAnd we had 21% growth. $2.9 billion in sales and 21% growth. So yes, DARZALEX is our single largest asset now for the corporation.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\n\nJoshua Jennings\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just touch on MedTech and outlook for procedure volume trends in the back half. There have been some concerns that there's some tough comps on the utilization side and particularly for the orthopedic sector. But I was hoping to just hear your outlook in how that's blended into this acceleration in the half? And then maybe also, if you could just touch on the pricing environment and your outlook for device pricing and where pricing stands for the MedTech portfolio? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSure, Josh. And I think my answer to your sort of volume question will be very brief and consistent with what we've shared before. For the most part, across the portfolio, we've seen volumes normalize. We did mention that we expected to see some of the--some tailwinds from the backlog within Orthopedics in the first-half of the year. And we've seen that, but we expect that to normalize in the back half. We remain consistent in our belief in the 5% to 7% growth for our end markets and that we will perform well within that. As it relates to pricing, inflation has not been a friend to our industry, and we have put a lot of effort into really ensuring that we can secure preferential pricing across the world. I do think we benefit from the global nature of our business. While there are pockets cost containment efforts that we're managing, like VBP in China, we see tremendous opportunity to really secure a premium pricing, especially where we have differentiated innovation. And especially now that we're entering areas like cardiovascular of significant unmet need, there is tremendous opportunities for us to ensure that we secure premium pricing for truly differentiated innovations, especially in areas like electrophysiology, in heart recovery with Abiomed, and more recently with Shockwave. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nYes, thanks very much. Could you please comment on the J&J U.S. pharma exposure to efforts by plans to extract greater rebates in 2025 than in typical years in order to offset Part D plan losses in 2025? Thanks very much.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nExecutive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman-Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks for the question on that. We're still in the process of working with all payers for the planned formularies and everything for 2025 and 2026. I think what's really most important is to go back to the guidance we provided at the EBR last year in November. And as we take a look at the corporation, we have factored in and anticipated what we think will happen. And as an organization, we feel very confident in the guidance of 3% plus growth in 2025, and really, importantly, that accelerating growth out through the end of the decade, the 5% to 7% growth.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Johnson & Johnson\n\nDave, I'd also remind you too that over the last six years, and certainly a compliment to John, Jennifer and the team, that innovation really underscores the success that we've had with quarter in, quarter out performance in our Innovative Medicines business. Discounts and rebates six years ago, as compared to list price was only about 25% of that list price. Today, that number--and this is not just the J&J number, but an industry number, gravitates towards 60%. So what we want to make sure that happens is this great innovation gets to patients and makes a difference in their lives and get them--they have access through the discounting that we already provide.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nDanielle J. Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick MedTech question on China. So China, it sounds like things are evolving in China. I mean this is no surprise to anyone. But just curious about how you guys are thinking about China as a contributor going forward given all the evolution in that market and some of the issues, VBP, things like that. How meaningful? I mean, it's been a big growth driver for you guys historically. How do we think about China going forward? And is the strategy for J&J, does it have to change to adapt to the evolving market there? Thanks so much.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nExecutive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman-Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Danielle, it's Joaquin. So, we were one of the first companies that started to operate in China, and we've been in China for decades. So, we have a history of having constructive engagements with China, and we are looking forward for that to continue. Now we recognize the situation and we have robust business continuity planning practices in place, and we are able to mitigate any potential exposure. But we continue to see China as an important growth driver, both for our Innovative Medicine business and also for our MedTech business. Specifically, you had some questions that Tim can address on MedTech and how we see our MedTech business in China moving forward.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nSure. And Danielle, we are fortunate to have a global business with more than 50% of our revenue already out of the U.S. And I think that gives us the flexibility to really manage a number of challenges that occur on a quarterly and yearly basis across the world. To Joaquin's point, we've been in China for 37 years. One of the reasons why we've been successful is our ongoing commitment in navigating multiple headwinds and opportunities. And when we look at our performance in China, remember, we had the end of COVID when we came out of lockdown, and so that has impacted the results in the second quarter. But when you look at on the ground, what's really happening is there's two factors. Firstly, you look at the impact of VBP, which is a government-driven cost containment effort. And given our leadership position in China, we are seeing that as a short-term tailwind. We do believe the volume opportunity will far offset over time the impact we're seeing on price, but that certainly is a short-term pain that we are enduring. That has also been exacerbated by the anticorruption campaign. You may know that in July of last year, the government initiated an anticorruption campaign, which actually has had an impact on both procedural volumes and engagement from health care professionals.\n\nNow I must reiterate that we see this as a really good thing. We believe that any effort on behalf of any government to really build integrity and compliance into the health system is a good thing for more fair competition and aligns with our credo and our commitment to compliance across all of the markets in which we participate in. So, it's a short-term headwind, but long-term, really good for our industry and really good for J&J. We remain absolutely committed to China. And we will continue, as we always have, to navigate some of the challenges we have on the ground with pricing and geopolitical challenges, and we remain committed to the 1.4 billion patients who rely on us each and every day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.",
    "content2": "Chris Shibutani\n\nThank you. Good morning. Together with my colleague, David Roman, a genuine question that we had related to the MedTech market dynamics and outlook. Can you help us better understand comments that were made about a fair amount of inventory destocking that's been happening and juxtapose that and perhaps reconcile with your expectation that the demand outlook would strengthen. We're just trying to put together this notion of inventory stocking, destocking ahead of an anticipated acceleration versus a potential deceleration or a tougher demand environment going forward? That would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you. It's a good question and the only area across the vast businesses that we have, where we have seen a destocking is really in our contact lens business. And you'll recall in the first quarter, we mentioned that on the back of some historical supply chain challenges, the distributor inventory was reduced here in the U.S., and we've now seen that bleed into the second quarter as mentioned earlier. And so, that is the only area of significant stocking that has had a short-term impact on our business. As I mentioned earlier, what gives us confidence is that as we look through the full second quarter, we saw sequential improvement across that portfolio. Remember that we actually serve the needs of 40 million patients. We have, by far and away, a market leadership position here in the U.S. and globally with contact lenses. And so, we see this as a blip and by no means a longer impact on our ability to continue to be leaders in contact lens. Thank you.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Chris. And Kevin, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.\n\nJoanne K. Wuensch\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)\n\nThank you very much for taking the question. I'd like to wrap up with the orthopedics question. Hips and knees are growing faster than the historic rates, could you sort of unpack that a little bit and give us an idea of how much of that is patient volume, price, new products or maybe something else? And have a great day.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nYou too, Joanne, thank you. We are so proud of--frankly, the resurgence of orthopedics, and I couldn't be more grateful for the incredible effort across the world to really return as to high solid growth across the two platforms that you referenced. Specifically within hips, and I mentioned this in the first quarter, for the first time ever, we were able to declare market leadership position in hips here in the U.S. And to be direct in answering your question, it is all innovation based. It's not only continuing to drive our best-in-class implants, but it's also how we've surrounded those with enabling like our VELYS Hip Navigation and Kenzie. That 6% growth you saw in the second quarter is really indicative our innovation working for patients. On knees, another shout out to the team, almost 10% growth. We haven't seen that historically and once again driven by innovation. In a short roughly 2.5-year period, we have launched our VELYS system for knees into more than 20 markets. We have more than 70,000 procedures, and that is driver of our performance. And what gives us confidence is that we're continuing to build indications. You may know in the second quarter, we received 510K approval for our VELYS Uniknee. And we also are looking to build out that portfolio. And in short order, you will see news about our commitment to really bringing robotics to other parts of the orthopedic portfolio, especially in spine. And so once again, it's all innovation driven, and we expect it to continue.

You may begin.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHello, everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the first quarter business results and our full-year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nPlease note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.\nMoving to today's agenda, I will start by reviewing the Q1 sales and P&L results for the corporation, as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2024. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, as well as Jennifer Taubert, John Reed, and Tim Schmid, Innovative Medicine and MedTech leaders, will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.\nTurning to our first quarter sales results, worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the first quarter of 2024. Sales increased 3.9%, with growth of 7.8% in the US and a decline of 0.3% outside of the US. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide and 7.4% outside of the US. Sales growth in Europe, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, was 6%. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $2.20 versus a basic loss per share of $0.19 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.71, representing increases of 3.8% and 12.4%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12.8%.\nI will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter, beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.6 billion increased 2.5%, with growth of 8.4% in the US and a decline of 4% outside of the US. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.3%, both worldwide and outside of the US. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth across Multiple Myeloma portfolio. Darzalex growth was 21%, primarily driven by share gains of 6 points across all lines of therapy and 10 points in the front-line setting. As of this quarter, we are now disclosing Tecvayli sales, which were previously reported in Other Oncology.\nSales achieved $133 million in the quarter, compared to $63 million in the first quarter of last year, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. Carvykti achieved sales of $157 million, compared to $72 million in the first quarter of last year, driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand. While sequential growth was roughly flat due to phasing, we continue to anticipate quarter-over-quarter growth with acceleration in the back half of the year. Other Oncology growth was driven by continued strong uptake of Talvey, our GPRC5D bispecific, and Rybrevant, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer. Also, in Oncology, Erleada continues to deliver strong growth of 28.4%, primarily driven by share gains. Growth of 22.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains, and market growth for both Opsumit and Uptravi.\nAs a reminder, favorable patient mix was a driver in Q2 2023 through Q1 2024. Therefore, while we still anticipate growth, we expect to lap this dynamic beginning in Q2 2024. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in Tremfya of 27.6%, driven by market growth and share gains. Stelara growth of 1.1% was driven by market growth and share gains in IBD, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in the US, and, as expected, share loss in PSO and PSA. We anticipate continued volume growth, largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry. In neuroscience, Spravato growth of 72% continues to be driven by share gains and additional market launches.\nTotal Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in Xarelto, which we anticipate continuing throughout the year, as well as a decrease in Imbruvica due to competitive pressures, partially offset by stocking dynamics in the US. Finally, it is worth noting distribution rights for Remicade and Simponi in Europe will be returned in Q4. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.8 billion increased 6.3%, with growth in the US of 6.6% and 6.1% outside of the US. In the quarter, worldwide MedTech growth was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to fewer selling days, disproportionately impacting Orthopedics. In Cardiovascular, previously referred to as Interventional Solutions, Electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.9%, with strong growth in all regions.\nPerformance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, commercial execution, and a one-time inventory build in Asia-Pacific, impacting worldwide growth by approximately 370 basis points. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15%, driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Orthopedics growth of 4.8% includes a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the US, positively impacting worldwide growth by approximately 300 basis points. As a reminder, Orthopedics was over-indexed by the impact of reduced selling days in the quarter. Strong performance in hips and knees was driven by procedure recovery, growth of new products, and commercial execution, while Trauma and Spine were negatively impacted by competitive pressures, and core trauma was further impacted by weather-related softness in the US.\nGrowth of 1.9% in Surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery, and strength of our BioSurgery and Wound Closure portfolios, partially offset by competitive pressures in China Volume-Based Procurement in energy and endocutters. Contact Lenses declined 2.3%, driven by US stocking dynamics, partially offset by strong performance in Acuvue Oasys 1-Day family of products. Worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 120 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3 2023. Surgical Vision grew 1.1%, driven by TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal Intraocular Lens, partially offset by China VBP. Now turning to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the first quarter of 2024, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold margin leveraged by 160 basis points, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 supply network-related exit costs.\nSelling, Marketing, and Administrative margins de-leveraged 110 basis points, driven primarily by timing of marketing investment in the Innovative Medicine business. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.5 billion, or 16.6% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.9 billion, or 21.4% of sales in Innovative Medicine, with the increase in investment being driven by continued pipeline progression. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.6 billion, or 8.3% of sales, a slight decrease driven by phasing. Interest income was $209 million in Q1 2024, as compared to $14 million of expense in Q1 2023. The increase in income was driven by a lower average debt balance and higher interest rates earned on cash balances.\nOther income and expense was income of $322 million in Q1 2024, compared to an expense of $6.9 billion in Q1 2023. This change was primarily due to the $6.9 billion charge related to the talc settlement proposal recorded in Q1 2023. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.9% versus 61.8% in the same period last year, which was primarily driven by the tax benefit on the talc settlement proposal recorded in Q1 2023. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming Q1 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In Q1 2024, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, as a percentage of sales, increased from 36.1% to 36.8%, primarily driven by an increase in non-allocated interest income, with Innovative Medicine and MedTech margins remaining relatively flat year over year. When comparing against Q4 and full year 2023, Innovative Medicine and MedTech adjusted income before tax margins have improved. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jessica. Hello, everyone.\nAs you just heard, we are off to a solid financial start in 2024, complemented by sustained momentum within our Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines, marked by significant regulatory and clinical milestones. Before we delve into segment highlights from the quarter, I want to touch upon some important announcements that we made that will further enhance our competitive positioning. Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Shockwave Medical. Johnson & Johnson has a long history of addressing Cardiovascular Disease through both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses. The acquisition of Shockwave, with its leading Intravascular lithotripsy, or IVL, technology, will provide us with a unique opportunity to impact coronary artery and peripheral Artery Disease, two of the highest growth innovation-oriented segments within cardiovascular intervention. This addition is not only adjacent to our other cardiovascular businesses but also consistent with our strategy of becoming a best-in-class MedTech company.\nDuring the first quarter, we also expanded our Innovative Medicine portfolio with the completion of the Ambrx acquisition. With its promising pipeline and ADC platform, Ambrx will further strengthen our Oncology portfolio and ability to deliver enhanced precision biologics that treat cancer. Now I'll move to segment highlights from the quarter. As Jessica previously shared, our growth in Innovative Medicine continues to be driven by momentum from key brands and the adoption of new products. During the quarter, we hit several regulatory and clinical targets that are key to delivering longer-term growth. Starting with Oncology, Multiple Myeloma, we received FDA approval and a positive CHMP opinion for Carvykti for patients who have received at least one prior therapy, making it the only BCMA-targeting treatment available for patients in the second-line setting.\nWe also received biweekly dosing approval from the FDA for Tecvayli, the only approved BCMA-targeting bispecific antibody that provides patients with dosing flexibility. And finally, we submitted an application to the EMA for regulatory approval for Darzalex-based quadruplet therapy and were granted US priority review by the FDA. In addition, we made significant steps forward in the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The approval was based on data from the phase III Papillon study.\nWe also received priority review from the FDA and submitted a filing to the EMA for Rybrevant in combination with Lazertinib as a first-line treatment option for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutation non-small cell lung cancer. The priority review and filing to the EMA are supported by data from the landmark Phase 3 Mariposa study. Turning to our Immunology Portfolio, we submitted a supplemental biologics license application to the FDA seeking approval for Tremfya in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe Ulcerative Colitis. We are looking forward to presenting data from the phase 3 Quasar study evaluating Tremfya in patients with Ulcerative Colitis at Digestive Disease Week in May.\nWe also significantly advanced our pipeline with important data readouts, including positive top-line results from the Frontier-2 study demonstrating JNJ-2113 as the first and only investigational targeted oral peptide that maintains skin clearance in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through one year. Nipocalimab also delivered positive top-line results in phase II and phase III studies in adults with Sjögren’s Disease and Myasthenia Gravis, respectively. We also received FDA breakthrough designation in the treatment of HDFN, Hemolytic Disease of the fetus and newborn, and fast-track designation for FNAIT, a rare and potentially fatal blood disorder in infants. Looking ahead, we expect upcoming data readouts for Erleada in localized prostate cancer, as well as Aticaprant and Seltorexant in major Depressive Disorder.\nPhase II results for our combination therapy JNJ-4804 in Psoriatic Arthritis, as well as pivotal data from tar-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which will be presented at the American Urological Association Annual Meeting in May. Lastly, we're excited to present our Phase III Tremfya Crohn’s Disease data, as well as our sub-Q data for Rybrevant at upcoming medical meetings. In MedTech, notable highlights in the first quarter include significant advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio. In Pulsed Field Ablation, we received CE Mark approval for Varipulse based on the 12-month INSPIRE study, which demonstrated 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence and zero primary adverse events. We filed for US approval of Varipulse based on the ADMIRE study, which showed all pilot phase patients achieved acute success and 80% remaining free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence after one year.\nVision, we launched TECNIS PureSee, a next-generation presbyopia-correcting lens for cataract patients in AMEA. we also presented new data for our presbyopia-correcting iol, tecnis odyssey, at the 2024 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in April.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to advance our Electrophysiology pipeline with the full US market release of the QDOT MICRO catheter, the US commercial launch of Abiomed's Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist, as well as the submission of Impella ECP. Within our robotic Surgery pipeline, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Ottava in H2 2024. Turning to financials, starting with cash and capital allocation, we ended Q1 with $26.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and $33.6 billion of debt for a net debt position of $7.4 billion. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in Q1 of approximately $3 billion. This was above Q1 2023, which included the consumer health business cash flow.\nAlso, in Q1 2024, we incurred elevated payment levels made in furtherance of achieving a responsible, final, and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. We continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and strong credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position and ability to execute against our capital allocation priorities. Innovation continues to be a main priority for the company, as demonstrated by our industry-leading R&D spend. During Q1, we invested more than $3.5 billion in research and development, or 16.6% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders through our dividend. We appreciate the value our investors place on the dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our board of directors has authorized a 4.2% increase, marking our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases.\nAs we stated previously, we are disciplined in our approach to inorganic growth and prioritize acquisitions that strategically fit and present meaningful long-term growth opportunities. This is evidenced by the pending transaction in which we are adding a profitable commercialized portfolio of Shockwave Medical in high-growth markets, as well as a robust pipeline. I'll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance, which excludes the recently announced acquisition of Shockwave. As previously communicated, we assume the closing of the transaction will take place by mid-year 2024, at which time we will update our guidance to reflect the expected dilution to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 of approximately $0.10 per share driven by financing cost. Based on the results delivered in the first quarter, we are tightening our ranges and increasing the midpoints for our full-year operational sales and adjusted operational EPS guidance.\nAs such, we expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.0%, or $88.7 to 89.1 billion, increasing the midpoint by $300 million, or 0.3%. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of 1.09. As of last week, the Euro spot rate was 1.08, a modest strengthening of the US dollar also experienced by a handful of other currencies. As a result, we now estimate a negative full-year foreign currency impact of $700 million, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4.7% and 5.2% compared to 2023, with a midpoint of $88.2 billion, or 5% at the midpoint, consistent with last quarter's guidance.\nWe are maintaining other elements of our guidance provided on January's earnings call, with the exception of two items. We are increasing interest income to a range of $550 million to $650 million. We are also tightening the range of our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance to $10.60 to $10.75, increasing the midpoint by $0.03 to $10.68, reflecting year-on-year growth of 7.7%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year estimates a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.03 per share. As a result, the reported adjusted earnings per share remains unchanged at $10.65, reflecting 7.4% growth versus 2023. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, we continue to expect that the same qualitative considerations provided during January's earnings call to remain intact.\nWe anticipate Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half, given the anticipated entry of Stelara biosimilars in Europe mid-year. For MedTech, we expect operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts in the pipeline that will drive meaningful near- and long-term growth across both Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We look forward to advancing our pipelines in both segments that deliver innovative treatments, solving some of the most complex health challenges. This wouldn't be possible without our employees around the world, so it's only appropriate, before turning to your questions, that we recognize and thank our colleagues for their continued hard work, commitment, and dedication to patients.\nI'm pleased to be joined by Joaquin, Jennifer, John, and Tim for the Q&A, and kindly ask Kevin to provide instructions to initiate that portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press Star, then 1 on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, please press Star, then 2. Please limit your questions to one question only. Our first question today is coming from Terrence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nTerrence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just a two-part on myeloma. First, on Carvykti, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the phasing comments that impacted sales in the quarter. And then secondly, on Tecvayli, how should we think about growth for this product?\nIt looks like it's been somewhat flattish over the last couple of quarters, but just wondering if Talvey had an impact there. So as we think about those franchises back half of this year, maybe you could provide some high-level commentary. Thank you.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Medtech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Terrence, for your question. Before we go into the specifics of your question on Carvykti and Tecvayli and Talvey, Multiple Myeloma franchise, let me share with all of you some reflections on this quarter. We are entering 2024 in a position of strength, and I'm particularly encouraged on the performance of our strategic platforms, the ones that are going to drive growth in the second half of the decade. In Innovative Medicines, Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, all grew over 20%.\nAnd specifically on Tremfya, now we have more sales in our psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications than we do with Stelara, and we have high expectations for the brand with Ulcerative Colitis data to be presented at the Digestive Disease Week just a few weeks from now, and also data on Crohn's Disease to be presented also this year. We continue to see increased demand from our new product launches: Spravato, Tecvayli, Talvey, Carvykti, with Carvykti just a few weeks ago receiving FDA approval to move into the second-line setting. Now let me move into MedTech. We have demonstrated Cardiovascular, in Electrophysiology, and Abiomed, and we have made significant progress with our PFA portfolio.\nWe also have delivered several important capital allocation milestones in Q1, investing heavily in R&D, raising our dividend for the 62nd consecutive year, closing the Ambrx acquisition, and announcing the planned acquisition of Shockwave Medical. As you have heard from Joe in his prepared remarks, we continue to make progress on achieving a responsible final and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. Overall, I'm proud of the performance in the quarter, both in terms of the solid financials but also the numerous pipeline advancements. It's a solid start of the year that puts us in a position of strength for 2024, and this sustained progress also gives me great confidence in achieving our long-term growth goals of operational sales compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030. Overall, it gives me great confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson.\nNow to Jennifer on your questions, Terrence, on Carvykti and Tecvayli and Talvey.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nWell, thanks, Joaquin. Hello, Terrence, and good morning, everybody. Just also a quick shout-out and a big thanks to Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world delivering 8.3% adjusted operational growth, definitely above market growth for the quarter, with strength being really across our core launch, our core and launch brands, nine brands achieving double-digit growth, 10 actually, if you include Talvey in that mix, strong pipeline progress that Joaquin noted, and also the announcement and closing of our acquisition of Ambrx, really to add another key pipeline asset for us, as well as key technology that can help us in ADC. So really strong quarter all the way around.\nWith respect to your question specifically Multiple Myeloma and then Carvykti and Multiple Myeloma continues to be a true stronghold for us, and we had significant performance and growth across the board in those assets during the quarter. I can start off real quickly with Darzalex with 21% growth, predominantly with that growth coming in the front-line setting. And also was noted that our PERSEUS data has been filed, which will offer us an additional expansion in front line. For Carvykti, we had over 100% growth versus the first quarter of 2023, very, very strong demand. We did have both the Adcom in the United States, which resulted in a unanimous recommendation for approval, and then the subsequent to the end of the quarter approval of Carvykti for that line two plus, which we think bodes very well.\nI know there's always questions on how we are doing and how we are expanding our capacity, given the strength of the data and the additional data that's coming through and indications. I'm real happy to say we have doubled our manufacturing capacity since the beginning of 2023 for cell processing. We are continuing to work on our Ghent facility to have that as a secondary source of supply. We've brought on some contract manufacturers, and we have completely transformed and expanded lentivirus production so that that's not a rate-limiting step for us. So I know we were roughly flat quarter to quarter from Q4 to Q1, as noted. That really just was some phasing and timing of orders and when they were actually delivered and billed for. Nothing that's anything to really see there.\nWe do anticipate continued growth for this asset, particularly second half versus first half, as we continue to add more slots and expand our capacity. Based on the data and everything that we're seeing, we've continued to have a lot of optimism for how Carvykti is performing. Likewise, as it relates to Tecvayli, the Tecvayli launch is going very well around the world. Consistently, we're seeing very strong uptake and rapid adoption, whether we're in the US, Germany, Austria, France, the major markets that have launched to date. Really, as the first and we believe best in class off-the-shelf BCMA bispecific, we really believe that that therapy is offering deep and durable responses. So a lot of optimism for continuing to drive the launch there. The product is performing well in the later line settings and is also performing very well from a competitive standpoint.\nLast but not least is Talvey, which is our 10th product with double-digit growth, although that falls in the All-Other Oncology category, so we're not fully breaking that out yet, but very, very strong uptake as the first and only GPRC5D off-the-shelf bispecific as well. So I think what this really means is we have got fabulous opportunities across lines of therapy with what we believe are truly best-in-class agents, and many of these agents have potential as well to be combined as we work towards a cure Multiple Myeloma. so significant business for us, and I'm very positive on our outlook for the rest of the year and going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Question for Tim.\nYour MedTech business grew 6.5% on an adjusted operational basis in Q1, but there were a number of one-time items. What was the net impact from those one-time items in your view, and what are you seeing around the world from a procedure standpoint, and what are your expectations for the rest of the year? Thank you.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Medtech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nWell, thank you for the question, Larry. Let me maybe just reflect a little on the journey that we've been on. As you know, we surpassed $30 billion last year with adjusted operational growth of 7.8%. I think it's important to note that when we compare ourselves against the majority of the competitors within our competitive composite, we are double their size. So that is performance that we are particularly proud of. We've now followed that up with another solid quarter of 6.3% growth in the first quarter.\nNow, Larry, to your point, there has been some noise in that. We are particularly proud of the tremendous double-digit growth within our Electrophysiology business. To put that in context, this is a business that is nearing on $5 billion, growing north of 20%. And I think that really calls out the leadership position, which we're continuing to build on, and couldn't be more excited about the progress we're making in PFA, which we believe also will continue to drive that performance. There has been some noise specifically in relation to our vision business, but please rest assured we are extremely confident in the underlying health of our vision portfolio. This is a business that grew 6.6% last year, and we expect it to grow in high single-digit performance this year.\nThere has been some stocking issues related to distributor inventory, which was the predominant driver of the performance you see this year, but once again, very confident that we'll see that return to strong single-digit performance for the remainder of the year. There have been a couple of one-timers, both in terms of selling days, as we mentioned earlier, about 80 basis points of selling days, and then a revenue recognition change within our Orthopedics business, which impacted that business by about 300 basis points. But all in all, a strong quarter, Larry, and we remain very committed to strong, high single-digit growth for the remainder of the year for 2024. Thank you.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nCFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nLarry, I just want to maybe add on to Tim's good comments there.\nThe one-timers, there was tailwinds and headwinds in that number, so the 6.3% that you're seeing, the 6.5%, is pretty much a true number when you consider both sides of the equation.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. I just have a BD question here. I guess following the Shockwave acquisition, what's the appetite, I guess, for further maybe talking about larger tuck-in type transactions, either in your MedTech or pharma business? It just seems like the portfolio and the pipeline at J&J has evolved pretty nicely over the past few years.\nI'm interested if you think the business is now at a point where we can think about maybe smaller, earlier-stage assets as the primary focus for BD, or do you still have a greater sense of urgency either in MedTech or pharma to add some of these kind of bolt-on type transactions going forward? Thanks so much.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Chris, and this is Joaquin, and I'm glad that you recognize the strategic consistency of our M&A trajectory, and that's good. Our M&A strategy looks for the long term, so it's not going to change. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to be disciplined, and M&A is going to remain a critical component of that. It's important for me to underline that with the strength of our cash flow and our balance sheet, we have significant flexibility to consider multiple types of transactions, as you mentioned.\nAnd what we have done so far, it's a demonstration of that with Abiomed, Laminar, Ambrx, and now the planned acquisition of Shockwave. All of them are good examples of our strategic consistency and the principles that we have outlined to you. So that is not going to change. Our M&A strategy is not going to change. We continue to evaluate opportunities agnostic to the sector and size, and what we are looking for, it's a number of components. One, does this technology improve the current standard of care? That's critical for us. To what extent we believe there is a patient impact which is positive. Number two, is it consistent with the capabilities and knowledge that we have in-house? We see a correlation between that and the success in the acquisitions.\nNumber three, does it enable us to enter into higher growth markets, so areas that are growing in which we can continue to develop that market? And finally, and very important for us, does it continue to deliver a compelling financial result for our shareholders? So that's our M&A strategy, and it's been a cornerstone of our ability to create value. I am glad that you recognize the consistency that we have deployed, and it's not going to change looking into the future. When we think about M&A, we think in decades. We don't think opportunistically.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nAnalyst, Citibank\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the question. Can we circle back to vision care, please, and can we unpack the different parts that are positives, and negatives on the IOL and the contact lens business?\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Medtech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you. Of course, Joanne. And thank you for bringing this up because it does look odd and certainly isn't consistent with our expectations or the performance that we expect going forward from that business. As I mentioned earlier, this is a business that grew 6.6% in 2023 and actually consistently grows in high single digits. We absolutely believe in the underlying health of our vision business and that it remains strong and continues to perform above market. As I mentioned earlier, the Q1 performance was predominantly driven by a contraction of US distributor inventory in contact lens. As we have mentioned in the past, we had some variability in terms of our supply, which resulted in changes within distributor inventory.\nWe've now started to see that as our supply for Contact Lenses has stabilized, we've started to see a normalization of the inventory that our distributors are carrying on hand. And so that is the big driver in the results that you see today. As you know, in contact lens, this is an annuity business where it's all about how you gain your fair share of new users while at the same time protecting the base. We are incredibly pleased with the ongoing performance of our premium Acuvue Oasys One Day family, and we are seeing unprecedented share gains in multifocal. I will also say that if we look at sequential share gains across the contact lens business, we are seeing sequential gains, which should bode well for continued performance for the remainder of the year.\nSpecifically to IOLs, as you know, we are not currently market leader, but we are expecting to deliver the fourth consecutive year of global share gains driven primarily by tremendous performances of our IOL business in Asia-Pacific and in EMEA. We're also excited, as you heard from Jess earlier, by the limited market release of our Tecnis PureSee and Odyssey next-gen multifocals, and we'll see a full release occur through the remainder of the year. So once again, very confident that you will see tremendous improvement in the performance of that business, and we expect high single-digit growth for vision for 2024. Thank you, Joanne.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nGreat. Thank you very much. Good morning.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nIf I could ask about the pulmonary hypertension business this quarter, quite strong. You mentioned in particular share gains and favorable patient mix. If you could help us understand that a little bit better. Going forward, the pulmonary arterial hypertension segment is anticipated to see some disruption with the introduction of the recently approved product from Merck, Winrevair. Can you comment on what you're thinking the portfolio will perform and how that market will respond to this anticipated shift? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHi, Chris. It's Jennifer. So yeah, we're really pleased with our pulmonary hypertension results for the first quarter, with both Opsummit and Uptravi delivering strong growth. That was both volume and share gains in the market, as well as some favorable patient mix, and really rounding out a year of favorable patient mix.\nThat last piece, we don't see continuing to go forward to the same degree, but the products are performing very well for patients with PAH. Importantly, in the quarter, we got approval for Opsynvi, which is the first combination tablet of a PDE5 and an ERA. This is in line with guidelines. It's really, once a patient's diagnosed, really the right first choice for them is to start them on combination therapy. And so we think that this is an important introduction. And as we take a look at our portfolio, and even despite other new competitors that are coming in, we do believe with Opsumit and Uptravi, they've got very strong usage and both with the launch of Opsynvi as well as what we have, that these will continue to be really productive assets in a good therapeutic area for us. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. Tim, if I could just follow up on MedTech and specifically Orthopedics and appreciate the one-time revenue recognition. Not sure you can provide any color on exactly what changed there, but also you talked about consistent MedTech growth going forward. I mean, backing that out, you get to sort of 3% US orthopedic sales growth. Is that the right way to think about that specific segment going forward, or am I missing some one-time tailwinds? Maybe talk a little bit about the outlook for Ortho given what you guys put up this quarter. Thanks so much.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Medtech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Danielle. Firstly, we are operating in a very robust market.\nAs we communicated in Q4 of last year, we still see some remnants of procedural backlog that are benefiting primarily our Orthopedics business, and we expect that to continue at least through H1 2024. As you mentioned, our overall performance in Orthopedics of 4.8% was impacted by a one-time change in revenue recognition timing. This is only related to our US business, but it did impact that business by about 300 basis points. Now, keep in mind, we also had the impact of the fewer selling days, which disproportionately impacted our Ortho business by 80 basis points. We are proud of the ongoing progress we're making, specifically in areas where we needed to compete better. Specifically in hips and knees, we saw high single-digit growth in Q1, and specifically in knees driven by the tremendous performance of our VELYS platform.\nWe're now, within two years, in 18 markets, 50,000 procedures, and are seeing that as a constant tailwind as we now expand the provision of VELYS into EMEA and Asia-Pacific through the remainder of the year. So I think you can expect continued improvement in our Orthopedics business for the remainder of the year as we continue to build our portfolio and drive further expansion across the globe. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Jeff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nCharles Young\n\nCredit Solution Advisor, Bank of America\n\nHi, this is Charlie Young for Jeff. I have two questions, please. I know there's recent news regarding the Invega Sustenna patent litigation. Can you just tell us about what we should think about in terms of the potential impact or in terms of the timing of the next steps?\nThen second, can you just talk about the TAR-200 bladder cancer data expectation at AUA in terms of what kind of benchmark we should expect in terms of the one-year CR rate? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nPerfect. Well, I'll take the Invega Sustenna question, and I'll pass it over to my colleague John to take the next one. So if we think about our LAI portfolio, our long-acting injectables, just as a reminder for everybody, we really are leading therapies in this space with our Invega Sustenna, Invega Trinza, and Invega Hafyera products. And we're really excited about the latest data that we have, particularly for Hafyera, which a recent study shows that at two years, 96% of patients on Humira, excuse me, on Hafyera are relapse-free, which is really, really striking. So as we get to the legal question, we really don't speculate on the impact of ongoing litigation.\nBut that being said, we remain really confident about the strength of our Invega Sustenna patents, and we're going to continue to defend the intellectual property that's associated with these patents. If we're clear to go a little bit deeper, the Federal Circuit's 1 April decision did not invalidate our patent. It just remanded the case back to the New Jersey District Court, the one that had ruled in our favor originally. Likewise, there was another ruling in another case on this patent against a different company that also did go in our favor. So it's going back to the original judge that ruled in favor of the patents, and we'll have to see what comes. We won't speculate on that, but we remain real confident on the strength of our patents.\n\nJohn Reed\n\nEVP of Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, thanks for your interest in the platform that we have, the Drug Device Combo for early bladder cancer. Clearly a great unmet need inasmuch as there are more than 600,000 people every year who are diagnosed with early bladder cancer, and the vast majority of those patients go on to have their bladders removed, which clearly has a very detrimental effect on quality of life. With our drug device system, which I think, again, is a great example of how MedTech and pharma can come together in a synergistic way, but we delivered really, I think, exciting early data.\nThose were presented at the ESMO conference last September and showed, for example, with the TAR-200 product that has gemcitabine, an impressive complete response rate of over 75% and nice durability with 21 out of 23 patients that we showed at that meeting still ongoing and no patients having had to progress to a radical cystectomy. So I think at the AUA, because those data are not yet disclosed, I can't provide details, but I think you can expect to see more of the same now with longer follow-up and with more patients. We've expanded those cohorts and do believe that we're on track to deliver pivotal data. In that first indication, which is in the BCG non-responsive patients, recollect that in the early bladder, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, standard care is this attenuated mycobacteria, BCG.\nUnfortunately, fewer than half patients achieve a complete response, and the therapy has tolerability problems, to say the least, where patients feel like they have a chronic urinary tract infection. The discontinuation rate with TAR-200 has been very low, so we're very delighted with the excellent tolerability profile as well as these impressive deep efficacy, deep and durable efficacy. So yes, so please watch that AUA presentation. I think we remain on track for filing early next year based on these pivotal data, and we look forward to sharing those results at that congress.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, thanks so much for taking the question. So a follow-up maybe on some of the device trends, in particular, cardio and EP, very strong in the quarter.\nWondering if you could provide some color, kind of geographically, as to how some of the product launches have either driven overseas or competitive environment in the US has affected US performance so far. And then just one quick one on Ortho if I could.\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Medtech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSure, Matt. Firstly, let me start on cardio. As Joaquin mentioned, we've made a lot of progress in building out our portfolio, and until recently, we only participated in one high-growth category within cardiovascular, and that being Electrophysiology, which I will touch on performance in a second. We are and have had a 20-year lead in Electrophysiology and now have built on that position in cardiovascular with the acquisition of Abiomed. We're now over a year into integrating that business and couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made.\nWe continue to perform ahead of the deal model, and once again, this quarter did so with growth in excess of 15%. That gives us now two leadership positions within cardiovascular care. Once we close the acquisition of Shockwave, that will be our third very thoughtful and deliberate move to only participate in high-growth, high-margin cardiovascular areas where there is significant unmet need and tremendous opportunity for us to grow. And so we're very excited by the fact that we will be one of the only strategics with only high-growth, high-margin businesses in the largest category within MedTech, $60 billion market, growing roughly 8%, incremental $5 billion of growth coming out of that category each and every year. So very excited by those moves. Specifically to your questions on EP, we've seen growth across the board in excess of 20% both in the US.\nand ex-US, and I think it really talks to the trust that our customers have in our technology today. RF and our portfolio of RF products are the most trusted and tested products with 20 years of experience. And by the way, we're not going to miss PFA. The progress we've made on ensuring that we can build our presence in that category with the approval in the EU as well as in Japan. We've also submitted for FDA approval, and while we don't control the timings, we expect that approval to come through by the end of this year or early next year. And so very confident in our ability to build on our leadership position in EP. Was there a specific question to Ortho?\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nYeah, just a comment on Ortho generally was sort of low to mid single digits, but in hips and knees sounded like 9%-ish.\nAdd back the selling day and you're at double digits. It's just kind of really off the charts growth, I think, in that category. I'm just wondering, should we see some sustainability of that rate or ramping down of that rate? How can you help us think about the rest of the year, in particular in hips and knees?\n\nTim Schmid\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Medtech, Johnson & Johnson",
    "content2": "Well, Matt, I think it's a testament to the progress of our team within Ortho in building out our portfolio. We had some gaps in the past, and now filling those gaps both in hips and then even more notably in knees with the launch of our VELYS robot is really what is creating the tailwind that we're enjoying today, and we do expect that to continue. Now, this was a strong quarter. Can we see that sort of growth every single quarter?\nNot absolutely sure, but we do expect high single-digit growth out of both of those categories going forward. I will also say that the work we've done in the Orthopedics areas hasn't been just about growth. It's also about improving our margin profile. And you know that in Q2 2023, we announced a major restructuring, which is focused on really simplifying our portfolio and focusing our business on where we could drive the greatest impact for patients and for shareholders. That effort is resulting in a 20% reduction in our implants. And to put that in context, we have 100,000 implants today within our Orthopedics business. And so a real testament to the effort of that group to not only drive top-line performance but also evolve the portfolio to improve margins. Thank you again, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Matt. Kevin, we have time for one more question. Thank you.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nOur final question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe if no one's after me, I'll just squeeze in two if that's okay. One, I just was curious on Spravato and sort of where it's been a very strong growth again this quarter. If you can just provide a little more context there on where the growth is coming from, what sorts of practices, what types of patients are given that product, it'd be helpful to get a sense of that trend. And then just the other question we get a lot from investors is on the drug price negotiations with Medicare on the 10 drugs that were selected for this year's program through IRA.\nI know you probably don't want to get too much into the specifics, but I'm curious if you can just share some high-level thoughts on how the progress of those discussions are going, and is it sort of in line with what you expected? Is there anything sort of very different from what you expected as the process plays out? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert\n\nEVP and Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson\n\nWell, thanks for the question, and thanks for asking about Spravato. We continue to be really pleased with the uptake of Spravato as we continue to launch that product globally. You saw that there's over 70% growth in the quarter as it continues to perform well for patients with treatment-resistant depression.\nAnd so we've got a bold outlook for Spravato as we continue to launch it into more markets and as we're able to even further penetrate the existing markets that we're in into a bit more of the community setting there. So really, really good outlook. We're also, just to put in a plug for neuroscience, we talk a lot about our Oncology business and our immunology business. Neuroscience is also a key area for us, so Spravato's a key platform. We've also got a ticker print in Seltorexant coming, and we had mentioned the long-acting therapies with the Invega Sustenna franchise earlier. So back on IRA, we've been really clear that we do think that the IRA's drug pricing provisions are damaging to the innovative healthcare system.\nIt is not something that is going to help reinforce the tremendous investments that we're making in R&D to develop the next types of treatments and cures. That being said, we do focus on patient access and are trying to make sure that our products are available to the patients who need them. So we're working appropriately with the government and in line with the process to start going back and forth around what the ultimate price will be. There has been a round or two of going back and forth, and so we're still in the middle of that process. I can't really provide any more details on that. What I will say is that the products that we have that are going through the process, they are not our growth drivers for the future.\nThey are our products that are more at end-of-life, and so they're not the ones that are going to be really key for us both in the coming years as well as out through the end of the decade. What I'd love to also reinforce is that we do remain confident that we've got a clear path to achieving our $57 billion commitment that we made back in December at our enterprise business review, as well as from 2025 to 2030 delivering above-market growth with the 5% to 7% compounded annual growth rate and with growth in every year, that being 2025 as well as all of the years beyond that. Irrespective of the IRA, when I take a look at our growth drivers and how our pipeline is coming in, we feel real confident about the state of our business. Wonderful.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Vamil, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess. Johnson & Johnson's solid first-quarter performance reflects our sharpened focus on the progress in our portfolio and pipeline. Our impact across the full spectrum of healthcare is unique in our industry, and the commercial, clinical, and capital allocation milestones achieved in Q1 reinforce our position as an innovation powerhouse. One of the most significant milestones this quarter was the announcement of our planned acquisition of Shockwave that will further strengthen our leadership position in cardiovascular.\nWe continue to make strong progress towards the goals that we set out at our December enterprise business review, and I'm looking forward to all that we will achieve through the remainder of 2024. Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Q1 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, and our financial outlook for 2024. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nPlease note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy.\nYou are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.

Moving to today's agenda, Joaquin will open with a few comments on our 2023 performance and key milestones, as well as highlights from our enterprise business review.\nI will then review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results, as well as full year 2023 results for the enterprise. Joe will then close by sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2024. The remaining time will be available for your questions. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last a little over 60 minutes. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a remarkable year for Johnson & Johnson. In becoming a two-sector company focused on Innovative Medicine and MedTech, we strengthen our position as an innovation powerhouse. We break through science and transformative technology. We innovate across the entire patient pathway in ways no other company can. And as we share at our enterprise business review, we have a stronger growth and margin profile, and are more focused and agile than ever before, which is what you see with today's results.\nI'm particularly proud of our Q4 results with Innovative Medicine operational sales, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, growing by 9.5%, and MedTech-adjusted operational sales growing by an impressive 9.1%. For the full year, we delivered strong and sustained performance with 9% operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, and 10.8% adjusted operational earnings per share growth.\nThese results reflect the breadth and competitiveness of our portfolio. And when I look at the milestones we achieved in 2023 and the promise of our pipeline, I have confidence in our guidance for 2024 and beyond. So let's take a deeper look at the business and what we achieved last year. Starting with Innovative Medicine for the full year, we delivered above-market operational sales growth of 7.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Our Innovative Medicine business continues to be fueled by growth from key brands and the acceleration of sales of new products.\nOur multiple myeloma portfolio is a good example, with significant contribution from recently launched products, including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI, and TALVEY.\nTurning to clinical trials, key results from the year included positive Phase III readouts for more than 10 of our in-line and pipeline medicines, including CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines of therapy in multiple myeloma, DARZALEX in frontline multiple myeloma transplant eligible patients, RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy, and RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer. And finally, TREMFYA monotherapy in ulcerative colitis. In addition, we saw positive Phase I and Phase II readouts for nipocalimab, TAR-200, and TAR-210, and we initiated our Phase III clinical development programs for milvexian and our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113.\nBeyond that, we received FDA breakthrough designation for TAR-200 for the treatment of bladder cancer and fast-track designations for milvexian in atrial fibrillation, stroke, and acute coronary syndrome. With 19 US and EU filings across our Innovative Medicine business in 2023, we have high expectations for the year ahead.\nOur recent announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Ambrx to develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates further strengthens our oncology pipeline. Now, moving to MedTech. In 2023, we delivered full year operational sales growth of 12.4% and full year adjusted operational sales growth of 7.8%. For the first time, our MedTech team delivered more than $30 billion in sales as we continue to build a best-in-class business.\nWe are accelerating growth through commercial execution, differentiated innovation, and moving into higher growth markets, as you saw with our successful integration of Abiomed and our recent acquisition of Laminar, who is focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.\nAnd at the same time, we are making strong progress in our pipeline, including advancing our OTTAVA surgical robot, MONARCH approval in China for bronchoscopy, and continuing market expansion for VELYS, our robotic-assisted solution for total knee replacement with CE Mark approval in 2023. In electrophysiology, we have a lot of momentum in our pulsed field ablation portfolio. We announced regulatory approval a few weeks ago for the VARIPULSE PFA platform in Japan and have submitted for CE Mark approval in the EU.\nThe TRUPULSE Generator has received approval in the EU, and we received first and only approval from the US FDA for a zero fluoroscopy workflow for cardiac ablation. And in the fourth quarter, findings from our QDOT MICRO catheter Q-EFFICIENCY study showed that very high power, short-duration ablations improved quality of life and reduced healthcare utilization for atrial fibrillation patients.\nIn addition, we are driving strong performance across our TECNIS IOLs and OASYS 1-Day family of contact lenses, including our most premium lens, ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, which has proven superiority in comfort and clarity versus the competition. Turning to Abiomed, we recently completed our Impella ECP pivotal clinical trial. In Q4, we also enrolled our first patient in the Abiomed RECOVER IV randomized controlled trial. As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business.\nAt our enterprise business review, we shared that we expect our Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7 from 2025 to 2030, with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030.\nWe also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 to 5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase III trials for TREMFYA in IBD, ERLEADA in heavy stage prostate cancer, our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113 in psoriasis, nipocalimab in myasthenia gravis, as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase II readouts for our combination therapy guselkumab and golimumab JNJ-4804 in psoriatic arthritis, nipocalimab in Sjögren's disease, and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.\nIn MedTech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7 between 2022 and 2027, and that by 2027, we expect 1/3 of our revenue to be generated by new products. In 2024, we'll see strong progress towards these goals.\nIn electrophysiology, that includes the full US market release of QDOT MICRO Catheter, and we are expecting CE Mark approval for our pulsed field ablation catheter VARIPULSE in Europe in first half of 2024. We plan to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for OTTAVA in H2 2024. In Abiomed, we expect US commercial launch of Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist and an Impella ECP submission in 2024. As you can see, our pipeline is advancing. Our business is transforming. Before I turn the call to Jess and Joe, I want to thank our teams around the world for everything they do to help our patients.\nWe have entered 2024 from a position of strength, and I'm confident in our ability to lead the next wave of health innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jess.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Joaquin. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales increased 7.2%, with 11% in the US and 2.7% outside of the US. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.7% worldwide, 8.8% in the US, and 2.1% outside of the US.\nIt is important to note that sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,500 basis points operationally. Turning now to earnings.\nFor the quarter, net earnings were $4.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.70 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.22 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.29, representing increases of 2.4% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.2%. For the full year 2023, sales were $85.2 billion. Sales grew 7.4%, with 10.6% in the US and 3.8% outside of the US.\nExcluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 8.2% in the US, and 3.4% outside the US. Sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,000 basis points operationally.\nNet earnings for the full year 2023 were $13.3 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $5.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $6.14 a year ago. Full year 2023 adjusted net earnings were $25.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.92, representing increases of 6.8% and 11.1%, respectively, versus full year 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 10.8%. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter, beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.7 billion increased 4%, with growth of 9.5% in the US and a decline of 3.1% outside of the US.\nExcluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide and US sales growth was 9.5%, and growth outside of the US was 9.4%.\nSales outside the US, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA, with increases of 22.2% and 19%, respectively. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in both STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 14.5% and 20.5%, respectively.\nThis growth was driven by market growth and share gains, as well as favorable patient mix, and TREMFYA. Growth of 17.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains, and market growth. Turning to newly launched products, we continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO.\nWe are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth in oncology. As a reminder, we expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and XARELTO, a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures, and the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA, REMICADE, and Prezista. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.7 billion increased 13.4%, with Abiomed contributing 4.5% to growth.\nGrowth in the US was 14.1% and 12.8% outside of the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.1%. MedTech was negatively impacted by international sanctions in Russia, worth approximately 50 basis points, primarily in Advanced Surgery and Vision.\nElectrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.2%, with strong growth in all regions, including Europe. This growth was driven by our global market-leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OCTARAY catheters. Abiomed contributed $340 million in sales within the quarter, driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology. Growth of 6.4% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by volume-based procurement in China, primarily in endocutters.\nOrthopedics growth of 5% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, as well as lapping of prior year China VBP price concessions in spine.\nGrowth of 6.6% in Vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses, as well as strength of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal intraocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by US stocking dynamics. Global Vision growth was negatively impacted by 140 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year.\nCost of products sold margin deleveraged by 130 basis points due to commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix in MedTech, partially offset by favorable patient mix, and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network-related exit cost in Innovative Medicine.\nWe continue to invest strategically in Research and Development at competitive levels, investing $4.5 billion, or 20.9%, of sales this quarter. We invested $3.4 billion, or 24.5%, of sales in Innovative Medicine, with the increase in investment being driven by higher milestones, partially offset by portfolio prioritization. In MedTech, R&D investment was $1.1 billion, or 14.6%, of sales, with the increase in investment primarily driven by the Laminar acquisition. Interest income was $212 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to $77 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThe increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances and a lower average debt balance. The Other Income and Expense line was income of $421 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $795 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThis was primarily driven by higher unrealized gains on securities and lower COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.4% versus 16% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net decrease of tax liabilities, including the settlement of the 2013 through 2016 US tax audit. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.8% versus 16.2% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2023 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment.\nIn Q4 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 32.5% to 29.2%. Innovative Medicine margins declined from 37.7% to 37.4%, primarily driven by higher R&D milestones, partially offset by favorable patient mix and leveraging and selling and marketing expense. MedTech margins declined from 24.5% to 15.5, primarily driven by in-process research and development expense from the Laminar acquisition, commodity inflation, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by selling and marketing expense leverage. This concludes the sale and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Joaquin and Jessica commented, 2023 was a strong year for Johnson & Johnson, evidenced by notable top and bottom-line performance beats relative to what we guided to 2023 at this time last year. We are particularly proud of the innovation we advanced to strengthen our development pipelines, the continued expansion of our portfolio, and investments made for future success. All of this provides us with a strong foundation as we enter 2024. Thus far during the call, you've heard about sales and income performance in 2023.\nSo now let's dive into some detail on capital allocation highlights. We generated free cash flow of more than $18 billion in 2023. At the end of the year, we had approximately $23 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion.\nWe maintained a healthy balance sheet and robust credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position, which enables us to strategically invest and deploy capital to unlock value. To that end, we executed against all of our capital allocation priorities in 2023. For starters, we invested more than $15 billion in research and development, or 17.7% of sales, an all-time high for the company as we remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. Jessica provided R&D investment by business segment, information we will continue to provide on a quarterly basis moving forward.\nAs far as dividends, 2023 marked the 61st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors, and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually.\nWe also deployed, announced, or committed over $3 billion in strategic value-creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes the recent Ambrx and Laminar transactions, as well as more than 50 smaller early-stage licensing deals and partnerships that complement our current Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines. Finally, share repurchases. In early 2023, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program initiated in late 2022, and in combination with our dividend, returned over $14 billion to shareholders last year.\nThrough the Kenvue separation, we further reduced Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares, or approximately 7%, without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. Looking ahead to 2024, Johnson & Johnson's robust free cash flow generation should continue to solidify our already strong financial foundation and fuel further investment leading to growth for our business or returns to shareholders.\nNow turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Today, we are confirming the 2024 guidance for those items previewed at our enterprise business review in early December while filling in some of the details. We expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5% to 6, or $88.2 to 89 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales.\nIn Innovative Medicine, we expect 2024 to deliver a 13th consecutive year of above-market growth, driven by market share gains from key brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA, and ERLEADA, as well as continued adoption of recently launched newer products such as CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI, TALVEY, and SPRAVATO. In MedTech, we remain focused on executing our key value drivers.\nFirst, advancing our differentiated pipeline, such as programs in pulsed field ablation, Abiomed, and surgical robotics, further shifting our portfolio into high-growth markets. Second, expanding our reach and scale around the world. Third, building operational resilience across our portfolio. We don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at $1.09, as well as other major currencies, we estimate there would be a slight unfavorable impact of $400 million, or a negative 0.5% on reported sales growth for the year.\nTurning to other items on our P&L, we expect our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points, driven primarily by a continuation of efficiency programs across the organization.\nWe expect this to be partially offset by anticipated STELARA biosimilar entrance in Europe in the second half of this year, and some lingering inflation impact in MedTech inventory that will flow through 2024's P&L. This margin improvement encompasses dilution of additional investment associated with our planned acquisition of Ambrx, which will be treated as a business combination. Now, we do acknowledge that this 50 basis point improvement simply gets us back to what your models expected, given the elevated Q4 2023 R&D investment for new pipeline assets.\nRegarding other income and expense, we anticipate income to be $1.2 to 1.4 billion for 2024. This is less than the 2023 amount driven by the impact of actuarial assumptions on certain employee benefit programs, such as lower discount rates. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest income between $450 and 550 million, consistent with 2023 levels.\nFinally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2024 in the range of 16% to 17 based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. This tax rate takes into account an increase of approximately 1.5%, or 150 basis points, relative to the recently enacted Pillar 2 legislation. We continue to believe the US Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 is harmful, reducing US incentives for innovation and resulting in US-based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments.\nOur full-year share count calculation for adjusted earnings per share in 2024 will include the remaining benefit equal to approximately 120 million shares from the approximately 191 million net share reduction in outstanding J&J shares following the Kenvue exchange offer. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 7.4% at the midpoint for a range of $10.55 to 10.75.\nBased on the euro spot rate of 1.09 from last week, we do not estimate any currency impact on earnings per share. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on quarterly phasing for your models. We expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe towards the middle of the year. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products.\nWe project MedTech operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year, expecting procedures in 2024 to remain above pre-COVID levels. The first half of the year will continue to have modest impact from Russia sanctions as our licenses are approved.\nWe anticipate China VBP pricing for surgical IOLs and orthopedic sports to begin in 2024, with impacts from 2023 VBP in electrophysiology, endocutters, energy, spine, and trauma to begin to anniversary throughout 2024. Regarding EPS phasing, it is important to highlight that the first half of the year will benefit from the full 191 million net share reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer, with only a partial comparative benefit in the third quarter versus Q3 2023 and the fourth quarter being neutral versus Q4 2023.\nSo based on the foundation strengthened in 2023 and numerous catalysts that Joaquin outlined across our business in 2024, we are confident in our ability to achieve both near and long-term financial targets. I'd like to close by thanking our colleagues for their dedication and commitment to benefit patients around the world.\nIt is their effort that enables Johnson & Johnson to deliver innovative therapies and solutions that address serious unmet medical needs and creates long-term sustainable value for shareholders. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star, then two. Please limit your questions to one question only. Our first question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi, now live.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the question. With my one question, I'm curious why you're looking for 2024 procedure volumes to remain above pre-COVID levels and your expectations for how long that will last. Thank you.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remark the strong close of our MedTech business in 2023. We delivered annually more than $30 billion in sales, which is our all-time high in our company history, with adjusted operational growth in the fourth quarter of 9.1. So very strong results across the board in electrophysiology, in heart recovery, in surgery, in orthopedics, and in vision. So when we think about our results in 2023, we think it's going to be aligned with our competitor composite for the year, but ahead of our competitor composite in the fourth quarter. Now, certainly, COVID-19 impacts have stabilized globally.\nWhile we continue to see some challenges, macro challenges from the point of view of inflation, hospital staffing, and the like, there is a bulge of patients coming out into the market after COVID-19, which has made 2023 market growth faster than historical averages. We see that trend continuing into a good part of 2024 and therefore being a tailwind into 2024. There's a lot of factors playing into that, but overall, we see the augmented procedures continuing into at least first half 2024. Now, we also have a number of tailwinds on our side other than the procedures that make me optimistic about 2024.\nWe have the trajectory of Abiomed in heart recovery, which is very strong with the adoption of Impella 5.5. We filed already for our Impella ECP, which is the smaller version of Impella CP.\nIn orthopedics, we continue to move into higher growth markets with the expansion of our VELYS robotic-assisted solution. We obtained CE Mark in Europe. In surgery, we continue to launch innovations across our surgery business with the ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer in energy, and ECHELON 3000 as a stapler. And we continue to see good expansion of our Plus Sutures, too. In our Vision business, we are expanding our TECNIS family into the premium segment of IOLs. And finally, and I know this is an area of interest to you, in electrophysiology, we continue to expand our PFA portfolio of catheters.\nWe obtained approval for our VARIPULSE loop catheter, PFA loop catheter in Japan at the beginning of this year. And we continue to roll out the global launch of QDOT MICRO, our newest radiofrequency ablation catheter.\nSo overall, a number of catalysts and tailwinds into our MedTech business into 2024. As we discussed in our enterprise business review, we continue to see our MedTech business growing at the upper end of our markets and becoming a best-in-class competitor in MedTech.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Terrence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nTerrence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a two-part for me on CARVYKTI. I noticed that an ODAC panel was just announced to review the CARTITUDE-4 data. I was just wondering if you can talk about the focus of that upcoming meeting and your confidence in an on-time label expansion for CARTITUDE-4. And then the second part of the question is, I know in manufacturing you've been ramping up in Belgium, and I believe that facility is now up and running. So how should we think about supply for 2024 broadly for CARVYKTI? Thank you.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Terrence. With more than 2,000 patients treated, CARVYKTI is already the fastest launch CAR-T in the market overall. We are pleased to continue to see quarter-over-quarter sequential growth in CARVYKTI. Overall, we remain confident in two things: both the risk-benefit of CARVYKTI in the indications that have been studied, and at the same time, on the potential of CARVYKTI to be a $5 billion-plus asset at peak year sales.\nRegarding the ODAC that you commented on, we are very confident on the data of our Phase III CARTITUDE-4 study that, as a reminder, supports the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines in the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. We presented the results at ASCO, as you know, and we also published those results in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nWe very much look forward to review the updated survival and safety data with the FDA ODAC in the future. We are committed to work with the FDA in the continued development of CARVYKTI, and we continue to have the focus on bringing this immunotherapy to multiple myeloma patients in earlier lines of therapy. We are working with the FDA towards a PDUFA date for our CARTITUDE-4 indication on 5th April, and with EMEA towards an anticipated CHMP opinion in first quarter 2024. So overall, we feel confident about the risk-benefit profile in this indication and about the future of CARVYKTI.\nRegarding your manufacturing question, we've done significant progress in our manufacturing capacity, which is a major driver in the continued growth of CARVYKTI. On the cell processing side, we have doubled our cell processing capacity in our Raritan facility since 2023.\nWe are making progress, to your point, Terrence, in our European cell processing facilities. We are already manufacturing the first batches of CARVYKTI for clinical use this month of January. We also have contracted additional external capacity to scale up production and increase our ability moving forward that will start mid this year. On the other hand, we have also made significant progress in the internalization and scale-up of our lentivirus production. We have increased capacity in Switzerland, in our Switzerland site. At the same time, we continue to progress with new US capacity and additional site in the Netherlands to produce our lentivirus.\nLate December, we received approval to expand our lentivirus capacity from 20L tanks to 50L tanks of lentivirus production in our US facility.\nSo overall, we feel good that we are progressing with CARVYKTI, that we will continue to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth in 2024, and we are working towards building this $5 billion-plus product and continue to transform the treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma, as we have discussed in the past, moving from treating to progression to treating to cure as we move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats to a nice finish to the year here. Joe, Joaquin. I'd love to hear just a general update on your M&A appetite and expand on your recent comments about Abiomed being a gateway in cardiovascular devices, which Joaquin commented on earlier this month. Thanks so much for taking the question.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah. So Larry, let me start. Good morning. And then I can turn it over to Joaquin. So we are very well positioned to continue to entertain many types of deals. As you know, we have the parameters of making sure that they're a strategic fit so that we've got scientific expertise and insights. A familiarity with the space has proven to be our most successful platforms. We want to make sure that we're earning a fair return to compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. It was only 13 months ago we were able to deploy $17 billion in capital for Abiomed.\nWe're very pleased with that acquisition. Not only has it beat our internal deal models, but it also is performing better than what the street had called for that business prior to the announcement of the acquisition.\nSo it's been a really nice fit. What I would say is we also deployed or announced, as I said in my prepared remarks, over $3 billion in capital for more than 50 smaller licensing partnerships or deals. And while those may have not made headlines, they usually are headlines when they become products for patients. And so that we think about our history of DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, CARVYKTI, for one. That's kind of been our track record. Our appetite is still, I would say, interested in moving into spaces that complement our existing portfolio, whether that be for the near or long term.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you. Look, talking about that, Larry, let me say we are agnostic to sector and agnostic to size. As Joe commented, our preference is clearly to be in areas in which we have internal capabilities and know-how, and also to go into products that represent a significant progress from the point of view of improving the current standard of care and that are first-in-class and best-in-class. To illustrate that, the two deals that we completed this year, Laminar and Ambrx, would be in that direction.\nFor example, Laminar is a deal in an area we know well, which is atrial fibrillation, and we believe could be first-in-class to be a device that can eliminate the left atrial appendage. When it comes to Ambrx, it's a deal in an area that we have a strong legacy, like prostate cancer, with a number of products marketed already.\nAnd this could be a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate in order to address a significant medical need in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in patients that have failed androgen therapy. So very much so. And in that context, we continue to see also opportunities when it comes to Innovative Medicines in neuroscience and in immunology. And when it comes to MedTech, to your point, in other cardiology areas, based on the strength that we have now with Biosense Webster and Abiomed, and not excluding also the potential for other areas like robotic surgery or segments of orthopedics that are growing faster and also areas of vision.\nSo overall, that's our approach. We try to put this strategic, scientific, and to Joe's point, scientific lens in order to be able to deliver value for patients and also value for our shareholders.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just Joe, a question for you. How should we think about gross margins in 2024 and beyond? I know you've talked about operating margins, but it did seem like adjusted gross margins came down in Q4. And I'm just wondering if that's a one-off result or a longer-term trend we need to think about as we think about kind of the cadence of your P&L over the next few years. Thank you.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. I think as you look at that specifically for Q4, what you have in our operating margins is obviously the Laminar transaction that was part of that mix. So on our slide that details IBT, you likely saw a quarterly reduction in MedTech specifically of about 9 points, about 2 points for the full year. I would say 2/3 of that is represented by the Laminar transaction. You also then have, I would say in Q4 specific, some mix as orthopedics performed probably a little bit better than it had in previous quarters.\nAnd then you have the inflationary impact, obviously with higher levels of inventory on our balance sheet that flow through the P&L. That is occurring throughout 2023, and we expect it to occur throughout at least first half of 2024.\nWe're not seeing any incremental inflation in, I'll call it, current activity. So it's not being additive to inventory, but it's also not subsiding either. So we're kind of at a new, I'd say, water level, if you will, that should be going forward, but not hurting the P&L as we look out beyond the second half of 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\n\nShagun Singh\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. I was just wondering if we could get your latest thoughts on the potential impact of Novo’s osteoarthritis data on orthopedic utilization, given the focus on WOMAC or pain scores. I believe the presentation could be here soon. Just curious to hear your thoughts, and also what kind of scores could or may not have a potential impact. Thank you for taking the question.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSo overall, look, osteoarthritis is a contributor to knee surgery. Sometimes I am asked about osteoarthritis in the context of the GLP-1s, and weight is not a factor in osteoarthritis. We continue to look at this data, and it's early for us to give you an answer there. Now, what we can tell you is that we continue to see an increased volume of procedures in orthopedics based on coming out of COVID, and we don't see any change in that, neither in the hips, in the knee area, or in any of the segments that we compete. So we are optimistic about our orthopedics trajectory.\nSpecifically, we are optimistic about how we are progressing with our VELYS robotic system for total knee replacement. We have already had 30,000 procedures with very positive feedback from the surgeons, especially in the ambulatory surgical centers.\nWe are now working to submit our 510(k) for our VELYS uni knee application. We are seeing a strong recovery also in our hip business with the combination of new products like ACTIS, KINCISE, and VELYS hip navigation. We feel good about our orthopedics business as we continue to see global procedure recovery in most markets. We continue to succeed with our new products, and we lap also part of the headwind that we had in China during this year. Very positive outlook moving forward for our orthopedics business.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nShagun, it's also important to maybe provide as a reminder what we commented on last quarter, and that's we're looking very hard at improving the profitability of the orthopedics unit. So being very selective as to what geographies we play in and what SKUs are actually going to be offered. So not only will you see some of the strength in the top line, as Joaquin outlined, but you should see an improved margin profile for that business as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analayst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my question. So just maybe an area we don't spend as much time on is on the respiratory side, specifically PAH. But just it's sort of a two-part question, but that franchise of yours continues to sort of outperform expectations. So curious if you can talk about sort of what's driving success there. There's also an area where you don't have a lot of sort of longer-term investment. So going back to sort of the business development question, I'm just curious in your interest in sort of PAH or respiratory more generally as an area of further focus, given your key franchises are going to be going away, but you do have the infrastructure there already.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSo first, let me underline the great results of our PAH franchise in 2023. We had growth in the high teens driven by improved patient mix, market growth coming out of COVID too. This was an area that was heavily impacted by COVID as pulmonologists were working at COVID and not diagnosing new patients. So overall, it's been a very positive trajectory of our PAH business, and we remain confident about the short-term future of this business into 2024. We are working towards the combination of Macitentan OPSUMIT with Tadalafil, which the trademark would be OPSYNVI, and that would be another option for patients there to enhance compliance.\nAnd in my talks with physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, they seem very positive about it, and we expect an approval of that combination in 2024. So that's the outlook for our pulmonary franchise. Are we looking at other areas there?\nThere, we are looking at the space and see if there are potential opportunities to be able to improve the standard of care. We continue to look to see how we can continue to extend the success of our pulmonary franchise into the future. Overall, we're very happy with the trajectory of our pulmonary franchise in 2023, and we expect a similar trajectory as Macitentan, OPSUMIT, and UPTRAVI become standard of care clearly established in this area.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question here. I just wanted to ask you with respect to your oncology franchise, do you have any thoughts on CAR-Ts for autoimmune disease at all? And then secondly, radiopharmaceuticals?\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSo thank you, Louise. We have a strong oncology franchise in different areas. I commented earlier in prostate cancer with ERLEADA that I discussed before. We'll see data in high-risk localized prostate cancer in 2024 with the addition of Ambrx now and an antibody-drug conjugate in this area. We are very, very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib. We have Phase III studies completed. We expect we have filed all the 3 indications, and we expect approval of that in 2024.\nSo we are very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer in first line. Moving into bladder cancer, you also will see data with TARIS-200 and TARIS-210 in non-muscle invasive localized bladder cancer. We received FDA breakthrough designation for TARIS-200 in 2023. Then we continue our progress in our multiple myeloma franchise.\nWe talk about CARVYKTI, but it's important to recognize how well TECVAYLI and TALVEY, our two bispecific antibodies, are performing in the marketplace and the continued growth of DARZALEX with the impressive per sales data that we presented in first line in newly diagnosed transplant-eligible multiple myeloma patients. So we are looking at CAR-T in autoimmune diseases. To your question, yes, but it's early data. As you know, we did a deal earlier in 2023 to partner two CAR-Ts, a CD19 and a CD19/CD20 BiCAR. So we are looking at that, and it's early data. It looks promising.\nWe are interested in radiopharmaceuticals. We believe that the avenue that we are doing with antibody-drug conjugates, it's an important therapeutic option. And when it comes to radiopharmaceuticals, we did a deal earlier this year with Nanobiotix for a radio-enhancer that is being developed in head and neck cancer.\nWe expanded our rights at the end of the year, and this could be another avenue to be there for us in which we could combine our expertise in medical devices, in medical technology, and pharmaceuticals. And we plan to do a broader development plan of our radio enhancer, and we'll provide you more information about it as we continue to move. So overall, we are very pleased with the progress that we see in our oncology franchise, both in solid tumors and in hematology, and it remains a core strength of our Innovative Medicine group.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about MedTech trends and margins. I think you mentioned some of the headwinds there were, patient mix. We'd love to get an idea, maybe kind of in the middle of the P&L, on the operating line in terms of margin progression throughout the year. Which ones of those of your business lines there are kind of more reflecting that negative mix that you described and how that progresses during the year? Thanks.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, Matt. I apologize, but it was a little bit tough to hear your question entirely. I think it was around margin specifically in MedTech and how that may progress through the year. So as I stated earlier, I would say that the margin profile is going to be impacted by inflationary pressures that were incurred really in 2022, sit on our balance sheet as inventory, and then kind of flow through the P&L throughout the corresponding 2023 and probably a good piece of 2024. That being said, Tim and the team are doing magnificent work in terms of finding efficiencies across the business.\nI highlighted one of the earlier ones with respect to orthopedics, but we're quite frankly doing that across the entire MedTech portfolio at this point in time, looking for opportunities, whether it be aided by artificial intelligence or just infrastructure overall, as to how we can further improve the MedTech profitability profile. Right now, we stand a little bit above the middle of the pack in terms of our peer set on margin, and we're looking to get towards the upper end of that peer set.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. I just wanted to ask you about the XARELTO patient mix that you guys called out. Just help us with kind of current dynamics and maybe looking forward, whether this trend you expect to continue. Thank you.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, Geoff, I can answer that one. So specifically on XARELTO in the quarter, we would say there's two items. It's patient mix, but there is also a one-time entry. Moving forward in 2024, we do expect that there will be a decline, but not to the extent that you saw in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS",
    "content2": "Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Joe, sorry to harp on the MedTech margin side of things. I appreciate everything you're saying for going forward. But just as we look at Q4 specifically, even adding back Laminar, we're still getting to sort of down 400 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. And I was just hoping maybe you could bridge us a little bit more. Is there any component of that, sort of price increases taken in late 2022 into 2023 rolling off, or anything that you would highlight there? Thanks so much.\n\nJoe Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nNo, Danielle. I think it's really the inflationary impacts. So out of the 9% drop that you saw in Q4, five points are really Laminar. The other or the balance of four points, I would chalk up to the inflationary impact that I spoke of earlier, and then the mix component whereby orthopedics, which is our lowest margin portfolio within the MedTech portfolio overall, performed a little bit better. So there's really nothing magical behind it other than the explanations that were already given on the call.\nAgain, we are looking at cost improvement initiatives, specifically in orthopedics, but across the entire portfolio as we move through 2024. But there's nothing that happened, maybe this is the best way to state it, there's nothing that happened in Q4 that has us concerned about our outlook or calls around margin profile or EPS for the balance of this upcoming year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much, and thanks for all of the details today. So notwithstanding the recently announced Ambrx acquisition, in recent years, J&J has executed more MedTech M&A than pharma M&A. I don't mean to belabor the point. I know that you got some specific therapeutic area questions, but could you just comment at a high level on what has held J&J back in pharma M&A in recent years and whether we should expect greater cash deployment to accelerate long-term pharma revenue growth going forward? Thank you.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSo thank you, David. M&A and external innovation has been core of our pharma portfolio growth and transformation. As I said initially, we are agnostic to sector. In the case of pharma, our preferred mode has been trying to go to assets that were around proof of concept. So generally speaking, from a size perspective, it's been about deals that have been either of a smaller size or have been different modalities like licenses or partnerships. Just last year, we completed overall at Johnson & Johnson more than 50 deals.\nThe thing is that the headlines are only made by the ones that are M&A. So we've done multiple deals in our pharmaceutical side in order to be able to enhance our existing portfolio.\nOur bias is to go for transactions that are going to enable us to create more value by leveraging our clinical development strength, our manufacturing capabilities, and our commercial reach. So hence why the majority of the deals that you see in our pharmaceutical side are at an earlier stage. Are we looking broader than that? Yes, we do. But mainly, we find more opportunities to create value at an earlier stage. For example, this year, we did a number of deals that went less publicized. We did, as I commented before, a deal with CBMG, now called AbelZeta, in CAR-T with CD19 and CD20, which we believe could be a best-in-class CAR-Ts in this area that could launch in this decade.\nOr at the end of the year, we also did another deal in antibody-drug conjugates with a Korean company called LegoChem Biosciences, which was underreported.\nBut we continue to work in identifying deals in our pharmaceutical space that enables us to be able to put all our capabilities to work in the clinical development side, in manufacturing, and in commercial. And that's been the source of very significant value creation in products that all of you know, like DARZALEX or CARVYKTI, that come from that type of approach of going earlier on into the development process.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, David. We have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today is coming from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is now live.\n\nRick Wise\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGood morning. Thank you. Maybe you could expand a little bit more on your electrophysiology comments. You had an extraordinary quarter. I'm guessing the new products helped. Maybe you could give us a little more color on, maybe quantify the impact, the negative impact from China VBP. And looking ahead, we've got one PFA device approved in the US, another one seemingly coming in the next month or three, maybe. How should we think about the EP franchise as we look ahead to 2024? What are you incorporating in your thinking? Thank you so much.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nSo thank you for the question. Great and strong results of our EP franchise in 2023. You should think about our EP franchise in 2024 as also a strong year, another year of growth, strong growth for our EP franchise. If I look at, to your point, the drivers of growth in 2023, it was across the board. I mean, it was in Asia Pacific, in the US, and EMEA. It was driven by the procedure recovery, but also by the new product performance and some offset, also a slight offset of volume-based procurement in China.\nThe new products that we introduced this year are the engine generator, our mapping catheters, OCTARAY, and OPTRELL, and also importantly, our QDOT MICRO Catheter in radiofrequency ablation that has efficacy results higher than any PFA catheter.\nAnd that, together with our strong commercial execution and broad clinical support across the board, has driven these results in electrophysiology that in fourth quarter was 25% growth globally, 22% growth in the US, and 29% outside of the US. Very strong results. We have a strong leadership in electrophysiology and 20 years of understanding this field. When it comes to our strategy in cardiac ablation, we have multiple strategies, but one core strategy is our CARTO mapping system. That is a fundamental pillar of our strategy in cardiac ablation that supports procedural efficiency and, very importantly, now low to zero fluoroscopy workflow.\nFor the electrophysiologists, it's very important to know where they are and what are they doing to the heart anatomy. Otherwise, they are flying blind if they don't have a mapping system.\nAnd the CARTO system, it's providing the electrophysiologist real-time feedback and very important parameters like tissue proximity, contact force measurement, and ablation indexes that give them an idea of how durable the lesion is going to be and what are going to be the outcomes of the procedure. So that's key for us to be able to have a workflow that enables the type of progress that electrophysiologists have been already used to with radiofrequency ablation. And hence, all our suite of catheters, it's going to be from day one fully integrated in our mapping system.\nWe have 5,000 CARTO systems already deployed globally and an extensive network of mappers to support the electrophysiologists. When it comes to our catheters, we are developing a full portfolio of options. You commented on VARIPULSE, our multi-electrode catheter that was approved in Japan.\nWe are developing a focal and a large focal catheter and also a single-shot one. So electrophysiologists are going to be able to choose the catheter that is more appropriate for their anatomy and for the workflow that they are selecting. We have five clinical trials active. Three of them have completed, and we have submitted our VARIPULSE catheter for CE Mark, and we plan submitting the VARIPULSE catheter to the US FDA in 2024. Ultimately, PFA is an important option, but RF is also here to stay.\nThat's why we believe that having the workflow and the procedure efficiency that CARTO gives you, plus the option of having a catheter like our dual energy catheter that would enable electrophysiologists to simply change depending on the anatomy of the lesion from PFA to RFA, it's going to be important for the future, and it's going to help them adopting PFA as this is the most widely used catheter in the world. So very positive about our growth in 2024 based on the strength that we have in this area and positive about the outlook of our ablation business moving forward.\nAs we have commented in multiple occasions, atrial fibrillation, it's an area that is still under-treated, and the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation and most likely the outcomes of PFA have shown significant improvement even compared to medical therapy.\nSo very positive about the outlook of our and the strength of our atrial fibrillation business.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call back over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess. The strong performance we delivered in 2023 gives me great confidence in the trajectory of our business. As I said earlier, we are entering 2024 from a position of strength, and we have multiple catalysts for growth. No other company is as well positioned as Johnson & Johnson to lead the next wave of healthcare innovation. We look forward to sharing our progress in the year ahead. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session of the conference.\nThis call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. If you experience technical difficulties during the conference, please press star zero to reach the operator.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 third-quarter business results and full-year financial outlook.\nA few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nPlease note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy.\nYou are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website.\nAdditionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.\nMoving to today's agenda, I will start by reviewing the third-quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions.\nJoaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, John Reid and Ahmet Tezel, our Innovative Medicine and Med Tech R&D leaders, as well as Erik Haas, our VP of Litigations will be joining us for Q&A.\nTo ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes.\nAs a reminder, on August 23rd, 2023, Johnson & Johnson announced the final results of the exchange offer and completion of the separation of Ken View, Inc.\nUnless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations.\nAdditionally, going forward, the pharmaceutical segment will be referred to as innovative medicine.\nStarting with Q3 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.8% versus the third quarter of 2022.\nOperational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency increased 6.4% as currency had a positive impact of 0.4 points.\nIn the US, sales increased 11.1%.\nIn regions outside the US, our reported growth was 1.6%. Operational sales growth outside the US was 0.7% with currency positively impacting a reported OUS results by 0.9 points.\nIt is important to note that operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA.\nExcluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.9% worldwide, 8.9% in the US and 0.3% outside the US.\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.69 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.62 a year ago.\nExcluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.66, representing increases of 14.1% and 19.3% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2022.\nOn an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.9%.\nI will now comment on business sales performance. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2022, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.\nBeginning with innovative medicine. Worldwide innovative medicine sales of $13.9 billion increased 5.1% with growth of 10.9% in the US and a decline of 2.3% outside of the US.\nOperational sales growth increased 4.3% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.2% with growth of 10.9% in the US and growth of 4.3% outside of the US. \nSales outside the US, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe.\nInnovative medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from our recently launched products with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth.\nWe continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 20.7% and 27% respectively due to continued share gains and market growth.\nWithin immunology, we saw growth in STELARA and TREMFYA with increases of 15.8% and 21.5% respectively. This growth was predominantly driven by favorable patient mix and market growth.\nTurning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO.\nWe are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECHVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth in other oncology. We expect to begin disclosing TECHVAYLI sales in Q1, 2024.\nTotal innovative medicines sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA and REMICADE along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures.\nI'll now turn your attention to Med Tech. Worldwide Med Tech sales of $7.5 billion increased 10% with growth of 11.6% in the US and 8.3% outside of the US.\nOperational sales growth increased 10.4% as currency had a negative impact of 0.4 points.\nABIOMED contributed 4.6% to operational growth.\nExcluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6%.\nOn a pro forma basis, utilizing sales in the prior year from ABIOMED as a stand alone company, Med Tech's growth for the quarter would be 6.4%.\nMed Tech was negatively impacted across all platforms by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 60 basis points and volume-based procurement in China, primarily in five Med Tech platforms: science, trauma, endocutters, energy, and electrophysiology.\nAs communicated last quarter, we saw a return to more normalized seasonality with moderate deceleration in the third quarter.\nThe interventional solution franchise delivered operational growth of 48.1%, which includes $311 million related to ABIOMED. This reflects growth in ABIOMED patient procedures in the high teens and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology and surgery.\nElectrophysiology is a major contributor to this growth with a double digit increase of 20.3%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched Q.RF ablation and off trial mapping catheters.\nOperational growth of 3.2% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our bio surgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges.\nGlobal growth of 5.4% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other as well as strength of new products, including Accu View Oasis, one day family of products and contact lenses, and TECHNIS Eyhance, our mono focal interocular lens and surgical vision.\nGrowth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges although these continue to improve.\nGlobal vision growth was negatively impacted by 100 basis points due to the Blink divestiture.\nOrthopedics operational growth of 2.6% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products such as the global expansion of our zealous digital solutions and expansion in the ambulatory surgical centers, partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China in spine and trauma.\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year.\nCost of products sold margin was flat due to favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit costs in the innovative medicine business, partially offset by commodity inflation, unfavorable product mix, and restructuring related to excess inventory cost in the Med Tech business.\nSelling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 40 basis points, driven by increased expenses across the enterprise.\nWe continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 16.2% of sales this quarter. R&D was leveraged by 120 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments in the innovative medicine business.\nAdditionally, IP R&D impairments were $206 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nInterest income was $182 million in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to $99 million of income in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt balances.\nThe other income and expense line was an expense of $499 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $226 million in the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized mark to market losses on public securities, partially offset by the lower COVID-19 vaccine related exit costs and lower litigation expense.\nRestructuring in the third quarter was $158 million, primarily related to the Innovative Medicine Restructuring Program announced in the first quarter.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.4% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a non-deductible, non-recurring pretax charge that occurred in the current quarter.\nExcluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year.\nAs a result of the completion of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson is presenting the consumer health business financial results as discontinuing operations, including a gain of approximately $21 billion.\nI encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax and separation related matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.\nNow, let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35.3% to 37.6%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and innovative medicine, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and commodity inflation in Med Tech.\nInnovative medicine margins improved from 41.4% to 45.4%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and R&D portfolio prioritization.\nMed Tech margins declined from 25% to 24.7%, primarily driven by commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a divestiture gain.\nThis concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you Jessica and thanks, everyone for joining us today.\nThis quarter's call marks a new era for Johnson & Johnson with a sharpened focus on innovative medicine and Med Tech.\nWhat has remained consistent is our credo and our commitment to patients. We are privileged to build upon our 137 year legacy of tackling the world's most complex health care challenges and helping patients with serious unmet health needs around the world.\nAs we look forward, we are well positioned to grow our business and innovate across the spectrum of health care. We are excited about what's ahead and what we can achieve in the future.\nBefore we dive into our performance, I want to briefly touch upon other items important to our business.\nThe first is a brief recap of the Kenvue separation, which was formally completed during the quarter. The transaction was executed within our targeted time frame and under budget, while generating significant cash and value for our shareholders.\nThrough the separation, we raised $13.2 billion in cash proceeds through the Kenvue debt offering and IPO. We reduced Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares or approximately 7% without the use of cash and in a tax free manner.\nWe maintained our current quarterly dividend per share and we retained approximately 180 million shares of Kenvue stock that provides cash proceeds for future flexibility.\nWe will see the full impact to EPS of the share reduction in 2024.\nAnother item warranting comment is the Inflation Reduction Act. We continue to believe the IRAs price setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients.\nAs we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by us and others, we did submit all requested information in compliance with CMS's drug price setting scheme to continue supporting patient access to our medicines that help them stay healthy and live longer.\nMoving to segment highlights in the quarter, as Jessica previously shared, our teams delivered strong results in the third quarter, while continuing to advance our pipeline to enhance future growth.\nWithin the innovative medicine business, two important regulatory milestones were announced during the quarter. Specifically, we received European Commission approval for a reduced biweekly dosing frequency for TECHVAYLI for eligible patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and US FDA and European Commission approval of TALVEY, a first-in-class by specific therapy for the treatment of patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma.\nRegarding clinical data, we are excited to have an unprecedented seven late breaking abstracts, including three featured in the presidential symposium being presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting this weekend. Highlights will include the results from all three phase III studies of RYBREVANT in lung cancer, including Mariposa, Mariposa II, and Patheon.\nAdditionally, updated data from the SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer will be shared as well as the first-ever data of TAR-210 in patients with FGF FR mutations.\nWe also look forward to presenting phase two data for Nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology annual meeting in November and have already launched a phase II combination study in [inaudible].\nLastly, we plan to initiate multiple clinical development programs for a targeted oral peptide J&J 2113. This includes the initiation of the anthem phase II B study in ulcerative colitis, which will begin this month and the phase III clinical program titled the iconic for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis expected to begin in November .\nMoving to Med Tech, notable highlights in the quarter include significant advancements in electrophysiology across our cardiac ablation platform.\nWe received FDA clearance for multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products in our portfolio to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. This FDA indication is unique to Johnson & Johnson and is a significant advancement where caregivers and patients are not exposed to harmful fluoroscopy related radiation during their cardiac ablation procedures. It also allows for the removal of heavy lead protective equipment that may lead to orthopedic complications for care teams.\nIn pulse field ablation, we have completed our clinical trial in Europe and submitted for CE Mark for our Vera pulse catheter. We expect the completion for our US Vera pulse study to occur in the fourth quarter.\nWe are also simultaneously advancing clinical studies for two additional pulse field ablation catheters, the STFS dual energy catheter, capable of delivering both PF and RF energy through the same device and Omni pulse, a large tip focal catheter.\nBeyond electrophysiology, we have completed enrollment in the ABIOMED Impella ECP Clinical study, a landmark pivotal trial designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Impella ECP during high risk PCI procedures. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and the only heart pump compatible with small bore access and closure techniques.\nWhile not a clinical advancement, we have also taken steps in the quarter to improve Med Tech's future margin profile implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our orthopedic business. As part of this two-year program, we expect to exit certain markets and product lines across that business. \nWe anticipate some short term modest revenue disruption in orthopedics of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, given the market and product line exits, but believe these actions will improve our ability to meet demand, resulting in accelerated growth and enhanced profitability.\nThe program is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, with total program costs estimated to be between $700 million and $800 million.\nLet's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the third quarter was approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $30 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion.\nFree cash flow year-to-date through the third quarter was approximately $12 billion, up from the 5 billion we reported year-to-date in the second quarter of 2023.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to execute our strategic and disciplined approach utilizing our strong credit profile and robust free cash flow generation to prioritize continued investment in our business, increasing dividends on an annual basis, executing strategic business development initiatives for inorganic growth and executing share repurchases when appropriate.\nMoving on to our 2023 guidance update. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter and the first nine months of this year, balanced with planned investments in the fourth quarter, we are raising the ranges for full year sales and EPS guidance.\nWe now expect operational sales growth for the full year of 2023 to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.0% or up $600 million at the midpoint in the range of $84.4 billion to $84.8 billion on a constant currency basis, and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.2% to 7.7%.\nJust a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any COVID-19 vaccine revenue.\nWhile we do not speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the Euro spot rate as of last week at 1.06, we now anticipate an incremental negative currency impact of $400 million, resulting in a full-year impact of negative 1% or $800 million.\nLooking across the P&L, adjusted pre-tax operating margin is still expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by stronger margin profile and business mix. Net other income is also being maintained ranging from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.\nDue to higher interest rates earned on our cash, we now expect net interest income in the range of $300 million to $400 million.\nAnd finally, based on current tax law, our estimate for the effective tax rate for 2023 will be between 15.0% and 15.5%. These revised estimates translate to an increase in our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by 10 cents at the midpoint. Our new range is $10.02 to $10.08 or 12.5% growth at the midpoint and adjusted reported earnings per share in the range of $10.07 to $10.13 or 13% growth at the midpoint.\nSince January, we've been able to increase our guidance throughout the year for a cumulative impact of $3 billion on operational sales and 25 cents on adjusted operational earnings per share, which includes absorbing 10 cents for our licensing deal with Cellular Biomedicine Group announced in the second quarter of 2023.\nNow I appreciate that many of you are turning your attention to 2024 and our teams are actively finalizing our plans for next year. With that context, allow me to provide some preliminary perspectives for you to consider.\nFor innovative medicine, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth from key brands and anticipate continued progress from our newly launched products, all advancing our robust pipeline with many exciting data readouts, filings, and approvals ahead of us.\nThis includes data presentations and regulatory submissions for TREMFYA in IBD, presenting data from our phase III study of Nipocalimab in myasthenia gravis and readouts from two phase III or leader trials in early stage prostate cancer.\nWe do not expect the entry of STELARA Biosimilars in the United States during 2024. However, as a reminder, STELARA does have a composition of matter patent expiry in mid 2024 in Europe.\nFor Med Tech, we expect our commercial capabilities and continued adoption of recently launched products across all Med Tech businesses will continue to drive our growth and improve competitiveness, while continuing to advance our pipeline programs, including innovation in pulse field ablation, ABIOMED, and surgical robotics. We expect procedures in 2024 to remain consistent with elevated 2023 levels.\nWith respect to tax, as you may be aware, the European Union member states are in the process of enacting the EU's pillar two directive, which generally provides for a 15% minimum tax rate as established by the OECD pillar two framework. The first EU effective date for certain aspects of the law is January 1st, 2024. As a result, we currently estimate it up to a 1% tax rate increase in 2024.\nIn addition, the US Treasury's current perspective on pillar two will be harmful as it relates to the treatment of US incentives for innovation and will result in US based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments.\nRegarding share count given the Kenvue separation, the full benefit of the approximately 191 million net share reduction in Johnson & Johnson shares outstanding from the exchange offer will be reflected in our 2024 financials.\nAnd finally, while we don't speculate on future currency impact, utilizing the current euro spot rate would yield an approximate 15 cent negative currency impact on 2024 full-year adjusted earnings per share.\nWe are pleased with our strong performance during the first nine months of this year and have positive momentum as we move into 2024. We look forward to sharing more about the strength of our business, promise of our innovative medicine and Med Tech pipelines and the long term strategy of Johnson & Johnson at our upcoming enterprise business review on December 5th at the New York Stock Exchange. More information, including an overview of the day's schedule will be shared shortly. We hope you will be able to join us either in person or on the available webcast.\nI want to conclude my remarks by thanking our teams around the world for their continued hard work and unwavering commitment to excellence on behalf of our patients. We are confident that our strategy will position us to deliver long term growth and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, it's my pleasure to turn to Kevin and begin the Q&A portion of the call.",

Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 second quarter business results and full year financial outlook. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Eric Haas, Worldwide Vice President of Litigation. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nPlease note that today's meeting contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, product development, market position, and business strategy, and the anticipated separation of the company's consumer health business.\nYou are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events and using the information available as of today's date, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.\nMoving to today's agenda, Joaquin will open with a few comments highlighting business performance achievements in the quarter, and outlook for the remainder of the year. I will then review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation, and highlights related to the three segments.\nJoe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2023. Finally, Eric will provide comments regarding the talc litigation. The remaining time will be available for your questions. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 75 minutes. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you Jess and good morning everyone. This was a strong quarter for Johnson & Johnson with market leading performance, important advances across our innovative pharmaceutical and MedTech pipelines, and a successful initial public offering of Kenvue.\nWe delivered solid sales and earnings growth for the Q2 2023, reporting operational sales of 7.5% and adjusted operational EPS growth of 9.7%. These strong results contributed to our confidence in raising our expectations for this year. You may have seen this morning the announcement that we intend to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as the next step in the separation of Kenvue. Joe will provide additional information later in the call.\nWe're excited about entering a new era for Johnson & Johnson, one built around science, innovation, and technology and strategically focused on pharmaceuticals and MedTech while maintaining our position as the world's largest, most diversified healthcare products company with 25 platforms, over $1 billion in annual sales, and on today's call I would like to share recent highlights and achievements from across the business that have contributed to our year-to-date results as well as upcoming catalysts that give me great confidence in our near- and long-term future performance.\nStarting with MedTech, for Q2 2023 we generated 14.7% operational and 9.9% adjusted operational growth, which excludes the impact of the Abiomed acquisition on a pro forma basis. Using sales publicly reported by Abiomed prior to our acquisition, MedTech grew 10.2%. These strong results continue to show that our efforts to improve the growth of the MedTech business are working.\nQ2 highlights in electrophysiology include the publication of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of QDOT, our newest ablation catheter for atrial fibrillation. In fact, this study demonstrated a clinical success rate of 86% as well as achieving shorter procedure and full fluoroscopy times than ablation with conventional catheters. I'm also happy to share that this month we completed enrollment in the third clinical study evaluating our pulsed field ablation solutions. The SmartfIRE study evaluates our dual energy catheter, which enables physicians to instantly switch energy source, whether radiofrequency or pulse field, based on patient needs.\nThe Abiomed integration continues to deliver against planned milestones and is on track across all areas and regions, with no disruption to commercial activities or pipeline progression. Second quarter sales of $331 million, compared to Abiomed's public reported sales in the same period last year as a standalone company, reflects approximately 20% growth. We also continue to see strong enrollment in the ongoing pivotal clinical trials, which aim to expand the use of our products into new patient populations.\nWe anticipate that heart recovery will become a significant multi-year growth platform for Johnson & Johnson. In orthopaedics, the VELYS robotic-assisted solution is poised for further acceleration. Having recently received CE and CA mark international approvals in surgery, we are pleased with our progression on OTTAVA, our next-generation soft tissue surgical robotic system, and we look forward to providing an investor update later in the year. In vision, we recently launched products such as Acuvue Oasys Max and Tecnis Eyhance, and we are performing very well across both contact lenses and surgical vision.\nNow turning to pharmaceuticals, in the second quarter of the year we delivered above market operational growth of 6.2% excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Of note, our multiple myeloma portfolio has grown more than 30% year on year, which includes the acceleration of our newly launched products Carvykti and Tecvayli. These new launches, along with Spravato, are performing very well and are expected to be important contributors to achieving our 2025 sales target.\nWe also achieved important regulatory and operational milestones, including multiple readouts from our pipeline. A few things I'm particularly excited by include, first, the receipt of Fast Track designation from the US FDA for all three prospective indications for Milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant, in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, which has the potential to treat a broader set of patients, such as those who currently have limited therapeutic options due to bleeding risk.\nSecond, the recent submission of a supplemental BLA for Carvykti to the FDA and European Commission, supported by data from the CARTITUDE-4 study, seeking approval for a new earlier indication in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Third, the presentation of initial TAR-200 data from the SunRISe-1 study in bladder cancer at the American Urological Association meeting, and finally, we announced positive top line results from the phase 3 PAPILLON study evaluating RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer with Exon 20 insertion mutations.\nThis is the first of several ongoing pivotal phase 3 studies to read out for RYBREVANT-based regimens in EGFR-mutated lung cancer. In addition, I want to highlight the phase 2 study data that we presented earlier this month at the World Congress of Dermatology for JNJ-2113, our novel oral IL-23 receptor antagonist peptide in psoriasis.\nThe findings suggest that JNJ-2113 has broad potential across the spectrum of IL-23 mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. We are already advancing into phase 3 in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and initiating a phase 2b in ulcerative colitis, and we will continue to assess additional opportunities. We are very excited about the potential of this asset, and believe it represents a billion dollar plus commercial opportunity.\nWe also continue to defend the intellectual property associated with our medicines, including Stelara. In fact, we have reached settlements regarding our Stelara IP with both Amgen and Alvotech. We expect Amgen to launch in the US on 1 January 2025, and Alvotech to launch in the US on 21 February 2025. In all, our pharmaceutical business delivered very strong results.\nOur pipeline is progressing well, and we continue to be confident in meeting our 2025 sales target of $57 billion. We are excited to enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, and we have high expectations as we evolve to a two sector Johnson & Johnson with a higher growth profile. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jess to review our financial results in more detail.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Joaquin. As a reminder, on 8 May 2023, Kenvue closed its initial public offering. Johnson & Johnson continues to own 89.6% of total outstanding shares of Kenvue's common stock and remains the majority shareholder. Therefore, the following financial results continue to include the consumer health business, with the 10.4% of consumer health net earnings no longer attributed to Johnson & Johnson being adjusted for in other income and expense from the date of the IPO through the end of the quarter starting with Q2 2023.\nSales results: Worldwide sales were $25.5 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.3% versus the second quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.5% as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the US, sales increased 10.2%. In regions outside the US, our reported growth was 2.2%.\nOperational sales growth outside the US was 4.7%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.5 points. Operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of Zytiga. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 6.2% worldwide, 8% in the US, and 4.4% outside the US.\nTurning now to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 million, and diluted earnings per share was $1.96 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.80 a year ago, excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items. For both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.80, representing increases of 6.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Compared to the second quarter of 2022, on an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.7%.\nI will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2022 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with the pharmaceutical segment, worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $13.7 billion increased 3.1%, with growth of 9.2% in the US and a decline of 4% outside the US. Operational sales growth increased 3.8%, as currency had a negative impact of 0.7 points.\nExcluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 6.2%, with growth of 9.9% in the US and growth of 1.5% outside the US. Sales outside the US, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of Zytiga. In Europe, pharmaceutical growth was driven by our key brands, and continued uptake in our recently launched products.\nWith nine assets delivering double-digit growth, we continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA, with increases of 23.4% and 26.9%, respectively. Stelara grew 8%, driven by market growth and IBD share gains in the US, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and increased rebates.\nTREMFYA grew 18.9%, driven by market growth and share gains in the US, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Growth of 16.5% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains in the US, and market growth. Turning to newly launched products, we continue to make progress on our launch of Carvykti and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO.\nWe are also encouraged by the early success of our launch of Tecvayli, and sales of which are included in other Oncology. Total pharmaceutical sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in Remicade and Zytiga, along with a decrease in Imbruvica sales due to competitive pressures. Imbruvica maintains its market leadership position worldwide.\nI will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide, MedTech sales of $7.8 billion increased 12.9%, with growth of 14.6% in the US and 11.3% outside of the US. Operational sales growth increased 14.7%, as currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points. Abiomed contributed 4.8% to operational growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.9%.\nSales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all MedTech businesses, driven by global procedure growth, recovery in China, continued uptake of recently launched products, and commercial execution. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume-based procurement in China, as well as supply constraints. The interventional solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 56.9%, which includes $331 million related to Abiomed.\nElectrophysiology is a major contributor to the growth, with a double-digit increase of 25.9%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our comprehensive portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT MICRO RF Catheter. Orthopedics operational growth of 5.7% reflects strong procedure recovery and success of recently launched products such as the INHANCE shoulder portfolio, as well as global expansion of our digital solutions such as VELYS robotic-assisted solution.\nGrowth was partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China and continued supply challenges, primarily in hips. Operational growth of 8.4% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery, and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges.\nGlobal growth of 6.9% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses in other, as well as strength of new products, including Acuvue Oasys 1-Day family of products and contact lenses, and Tecnis Eyhance, our monofocal intraocular lens, and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges, although these continue to improve.\nMoving to the Consumer health segment, worldwide consumer health sales of $4 billion increased 5.4%, with growth of 6% in the US and 5% outside the US. Operational sales growth increased 7.7%, as currency had a negative impact of 2.3 points. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all consumer health franchises, primarily driven by strategic price increases and growth in OTC globally due to strong pain, performance, and cold, cough, and flu season.\nExcluding the impact of strategic portfolio decisions and sales of personal care products in Russia, volume across all consumer franchises was relatively flat on strong price actions. For more detailed information, please visit investors.kenvue.com. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year.\nCost of products sold leveraged by 80 basis points, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related cost in the pharmaceutical business, partially offset by commodity inflation in the consumer and MedTech businesses. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 20 basis points, driven by incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, partially offset by proactive management of costs.\nWe continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was a 3.4% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was income of $60 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022.\nThis was primarily driven by favorable litigation settlements, lower litigation expense, and lower unrealized losses on securities, partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related cost and, as previously mentioned, the 10.4% of consumer health earnings that are no longer attributable to Johnson & Johnson, which resulted in a $37 million reduction in consolidated earnings.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9% versus 17.6% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2023 tax cost incurred as part of the planned separation of the consumer health business due to the internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.6% versus 15.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 34% to 34.6%, primarily driven by favorable product and patient mix, partially offset by unfavorable segment mix and commodity inflation.\nPharmaceutical margins improved from 42% to 42.7%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix, sales, marketing, and administrative expense leverage, and R&D portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments. MedTech margins improved from 26.5% to 28.6%, 20% driven by favorable intellectual property-related litigation settlements and cost management initiatives, partially offset by commodity inflation.\nFinally, consumer health margins declined from 25.9% to 23.5% due to incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, foreign exchange impacts, and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. It is important to highlight that the adjusted income before tax for the consumer health business as reported by Johnson & Johnson differs from the financial results reported by Kenvue this morning.\nThe difference is primarily driven by incremental costs required to run Kenvue as an independent company. Additional differences also exist on an after-tax basis due to the application of different tax rates. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson second quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe, thank you.\n\nJoseph Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nyou, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As previously shared, we reported particularly strong results across all segments for the second quarter and the first half of 2023. During the second quarter, adjusted operational sales growth by Pharmaceuticals excluding COVID-19 revenue accelerated 6.2% over the first quarter of 2023. Similarly, on a sequential basis, MedTech operational sales increased 4.5% over an already strong first quarter.\nDuring the first half of the year, we executed against our long-term business strategy and achieved key clinical and regulatory milestones. These advancements provide a strong foundation for long-term growth and are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented colleagues around the world. We also made considerable progress toward the separation of Kenvue on 8 May as partial consideration for the transfer of the consumer health business.\nKenvue paid $13.2 billion to Johnson & Johnson from the net proceeds of the initial public offering and debt financing transactions in connection with the separation. Today we were pleased to announce an update on our next step toward the separation of Kenvue. Subject to market conditions, our intention is to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation.\nAs part of the proposed exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some, or none of their shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock for shares of Kenvue common stock, subject to the terms of an offer. We believe a split off is the most advantageous form of separation for Johnson & Johnson, Kenvue, and our shareholders.\nSpecifically, an exchange offer provides Johnson & Johnson the potential opportunity to acquire a large number of outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock at one time, and in a tax-free manner for US federal income tax purposes, without reducing overall cash or future financial flexibility. Further, following the completion of the exchange offer, Kenvue would most likely have a shareholder base that would have made the election to own its shares.\nThe exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days. Offer terms for the exchange, inclusive of applicable discounts, as well as the duration of the exchange tender period, would be set upon launch. We understand that you may have questions on this process. At this point, there are no additional details about the contemplated split off to share, but we are committed to providing timely updates as appropriate.\nLet's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $46 billion of debt, for a net debt position of $17 billion inclusive of approximately $7 billion of Kenvue. Net debt free cash flow through the second quarter was approximately $5.4 billion compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year. The second quarter reflects elevated tax payments of approximately $2 billion related to TCJA and past audit related matters.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, with continued investment in our business being the highest priority to drive new and better solutions for patients, followed by dividends increasing on an annual basis, adding strategic opportunities for inorganic growth, and share repurchases when attractive. Our R&D investment in the first half of 2023 was $7.4 billion, or approximately 15% of sales.\nThis includes external investments such as our recently announced partnership with Cellular Biomedicine Group on two next generation CAR-Ts for the treatment of B cell malignancies, further broadening our cell therapy portfolio. In April, we announced our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases, and in combination with the completion of our $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board in September 2022 and completed earlier this year, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2023.\nLet's discuss our outlook for the balance of 2023. Before I get into the specifics of guidance, in light of the potential Kenvue split-off transaction, I will remind full year guidance today continues to include results from the consumer health business given Johnson & Johnson remains the majority shareholder of Kenvue.\nI suspect you already know this, but it would not be accurate to subtract any guidance provided separately by Kenvue from total Johnson & Johnson guidance and assume that the resulting total reflects guidance for the new Johnson & Johnson.\nWhen Johnson & Johnson is no longer the majority shareholder of Kenvue, we will provide timely updates, updated new Johnson & Johnson guidance that will reflect, among other things, the removal of Consumer Health's current contribution to Johnson & Johnson's performance, as well as any updates to Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count.\nWith that context, moving on to our full year guidance, based on the strong results delivered in the quarter, like we did in April, we are again raising full year operational sales and EPS guidance, despite some strategic items not accretive to EPS as detailed on this schedule.\nSpecifically, the lost income related to the approximate 10% non-controlling interest in Kenvue and the acquired in-process research and development costs related to our investment in Cellular Biomedicine Group. We now expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 to be in the range of 7% to 8%, or up $1.4 billion in the range of $99.3 billion to $100.3 billion on a constant curr, and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%.\nAs you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter we noted that we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar at 1.10. The euro spot rate as of mid last week remains at 1.10. However, the US dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies such as the yuan and the yen.\nAs such, we now estimate a negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 500 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 6.5% to 7.5% compared to 2022, with a midpoint of $99.3 billion.\nRegarding other lines on the P and L, we now anticipate a slight improvement to our adjusted pretax operating margin, driven by expense management. We have reduced our other income estimate to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily related to the company's 10.4% noncontrolling interest in Kenvue. Regarding interest income and expense, we now anticipate a reduction of net interest expense to the range of $150 million to $250 million due to interest income on the net proceeds linked to the Kenvue separation.\nFinally, based on current tax law, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. These changes result in us increasing our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.60 to $10.70, or $10.65 at the midpoint, on a constant currency basis. Constant currency growth of 5% at the midpoint.\nWhile not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year assumes no additional foreign exchange impact. As such, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year increases by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.70 to $10.80, or $10.75 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 6% at the midpoint.\nWhile we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, let me offer some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. In MedTech, we continue to anticipate stable procedure volumes and healthcare staffing levels in the back half of the year. With normal seasonality, we expect continued competitive performance attributable to commercial execution.\nRecently launched products and improvement in supply headwinds from volume-based procurement in China, as well as potential impacts from international sanctions in Russia, are expected to be higher in the second half than the first half of the year. In pharmaceuticals, we continue to expect to deliver our 12th consecutive year of above-market growth in 2023, driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products.\nWe expect continued strong growth in the back half of the year, slightly higher than the first half. When modeling consumer health growth rates in 2023, it's important to take into consideration prior year comparisons with lapping price increases in the back half of the year.\nGiven the strong momentum in our pharmaceutical business and the upcoming clinical milestones mentioned earlier, we remain very confident in our ability to meet our 2025 pharmaceutical sales target of $57 billion. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts for the remainder of the year that can drive meaningful near and long term value beyond the separation.\nIn the near term, we are continuing to drive performance in MedTech with better commercial execution, and recently launched innovative products being a significant factor in driving the continued higher growth trajectory across the MedTech business. Many of the solutions mentioned are early in their commercialization, which means there is still significant opportunity ahead. For example, in electrophysiology, we are excited to begin the commercialization of the QDOT MICRO catheter in the US during the second half of this year.\nIn orthopedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution recently received regulatory approvals in Europe, and we plan to launch it in key European countries by the end of this year. We are seeing the benefits of our recently launched innovations, such as Acuvue Oasys Max 1-Day Multifocal, which is driving Johnson & Johnson's market share growth in the large and growing presbyopia market.\nWe look forward to continued growth from this and other recent vision launches. Related to our pharmaceutical business, we are excited about upcoming advancements in our pipeline, with a number of important regulatory and clinical milestones for our key future assets. On the regulatory front, there is expected approval of talquetamab in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\nClinically, we expect phase 3 data for TREMFYA for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the results of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT + LAZERTINIB in frontline non-small cell lung cancer, with the opportunity to potentially present that data at an upcoming major medical meeting. Phase 1 data for TAR-210 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and phase 2 data for nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis.\nA couple of other items to highlight in case you missed them. We recently published our Health for Humanity Report, our US pharmaceutical pricing transparency report, and our US patent table, all of which can be found on our website. Also, a reminder that we will be hosting an Enterprise Business Review featuring both pharmaceutical and MedTech at the New York Stock Exchange on 5 December 2024.\nI'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating that we have had a strong first half of the year, both financially and operationally, and we expect to continue to build upon that momentum in the second half of this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric Haas.\n\nEric Haas\n\nVP of Litigation, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joe. On Tuesday, 18 July 2023, in the case of Valdez v. Johnson & Johnson, a jury in Alameda County, California ruled in favor of the plaintiff on his talc product liability claims. We intend to pursue an appeal based on the erroneous rulings by the trial judge that prevented us from sharing with the jury critical facts that demonstrate that plaintiff's exceedingly rare form of mesothelioma was not caused by baby powder.\nWithout the benefit of that evidence, the jury rendered a verdict that is irreconcilable with the decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson & Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer. The research, clinical evidence, and over 40 years of studies by independent medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of our cosmetic talc.\nThe verdict award will not be paid while the bankruptcy proceeding continues, and this decision has absolutely no impact on that process, which has the support of lawyers representing the majority of claimants. We remain focused on all claimants having the opportunity to vote and decide for themselves on our plan to compensate them in a timely and efficient manner.\nLooking ahead with respect to the bankruptcy refiling by LTL, the bankruptcy judge is expected to rule by 2 August 2024 on the motion to dismiss hearing that took place in the last week of June. In addition, a hearing on the motion for LTL's proposed reorganization plan and voting procedures process in the path forward is scheduled for 22 August 2024. As we previously stated, Johnson & Johnson stands by its position that its talcum powder products are safe, as confirmed through decades of numerous independent scientific tests and studies. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jess.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Eric. This concludes the prepared remarks section of our call. I will now turn the discussion over to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, press star then. Please limit your questions to one question only. Our first question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on another strong quarter here. You know, for Eric, if Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy proposal, what's the backup settlement in mind that would proceed outside of bankruptcy? You know, that could ring fence, you know, the cost. Joe or Joaquin, in MedTech, how are you thinking about the sustainability of the first half strength, regroup 8% organic? Do you still expect the MedTech market to grow 5% to 7% this year? With change in that range, it seems conservative. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nEric Haas\n\nVP of Litigation, Johnson & Johnson\n\nHi, it's Eric. Thanks for the question. If Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy, we will be back in the tort system. In that scenario, we intend to fight the claims aggressively, and indeed, based upon the indicated decades of scientific support for the safety of our talc products, the fact that our talc products do not contain asbestos, and the fact that our talc products do not cause cancer, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to prevail in the vast majority of claims as we have done in the past in the tort system.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you. Thank you, Larry, and thank you for complimenting us on the results on the first quarter and also on the MedTech ones. When it comes to the MedTech results, the growth in the first half of the year was north of 8%. This is a continuation of the sustained improvement in our performance that we have had in the last couple of years, in which we have grown at or above our competitive composite.\nWhen we think about the dynamics that are driving our growth, which are multiple, one is the recovery in the overall market procedures, which is helping our improved commercial execution, and very especially the cadence and flow of new product launches that we are having in the market. We see our trajectory in MedTech in the first half of the year continuing in the second half of the year. We expect a similar trajectory for MedTech in the second half of the year.\n\nJoseph Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nLarry, maybe I might just add to Joaquin's comments. The only thing that is limiting the growth, I would say in the back half of the year is China volume-based pricing, as well as some international sanctions in Russia. Those are already incorporated into our outlook for the balance of 2023. We feel we have those well in hand. If there's a little bit of abatement on either of those fronts, it portends well for the future.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. Our next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking my question. Maybe just one on the guidance commenters. I appreciate what you said around the Kenvue and Cellular Biomedicine dynamics. I'm curious about Stelara because you have the two settlements now. I don't think there's any chance for having a biosimilar enter this year, and I think before you had expected that.\nI'm curious what your expectations are now in terms of biosimilar entry before Amgen, and how does that impact your guidance expectations for this year. If you want to comment on next year or how it might impact 2025 with the $57 billion there. One other one, if I could, just on MARIPOSA. We've been getting a lot of questions on what's changed there.\nI know before the study is supposed to end next year, we obviously heard about the interim on your last earnings call. In the last few weeks, it sounds like there's a chance we'll get the data sooner this year, and you may even be able to present it. Kind of what's changed from April to now to give you a sense that the data may come a little bit earlier and give you a chance to present it this year. Thank you.\n\nJoseph Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks for the questions, Vamil. I'll start with Stelara and then see if Eric can add anything from a legal perspective, and then we'll turn it over to Joaquin for your question on the MARIPOSA study. With respect to Stelara, this year there won't be a significant impact. As you can imagine, most of that business was contracted for the full year about this time last year, so there really wasn't any material impact. Our current assumption, based on some of the agreements you read about, similar to what we've said previously, is that we wouldn't expect anything before 1 January 2025. I don't know, Eric, from a legal perspective, anything to add?\n\nEric Haas\n\nVP of Litigation, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah, thanks Joe. From a litigation perspective, I could say that no other biosimilar is better positioned in our view than Amgen or Alvotech would be. We would not anticipate any other biosimilar having the opportunity or ability to enter the market before those two.\n\nJoseph Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you. And with respect to MARIPOSA, nothing has changed. This is an event-driven study with a final analysis expected, as we said, by the end of 2023, with a potential to be presented at a major medical meeting in 2023. We remain excited about the potential of RYBREVANT in combination with Lazertinib to become a new standard of care in first line non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations, and we are looking forward to be able to present these results in due time in a medical meeting, potentially this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now live.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGood morning and thank you for taking the questions. I'm trying to think about two things as I look forward to. Given the strength in the first half of the year in MedTech, does this create, in your opinion, a new base from which we grow from, or are we going to be writing about difficult comps next year? Second of all, with Kenvue split off by within days or by the end of this year, I anticipate how do we think about different investments in the MedTech and the pharmaceutical franchises, either through pure R&D internally or externally? Thank you.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nAs I commented in the earlier question, we are pleased with the strength of our MedTech business in the first half of the year with 8% growth. This is driven by market growth, which we believe is also slightly elevated this year due to the clearing of the COVID-19 backlog, at the same time as I commented to our improved commercial execution and the introduction of new products.\nOf note, of our $12 billion platforms in MedTech, all of them have grown during the first half of the year, and we are being quite successful in introducing some important new products in all segments of our business. For example, if I start with electrophysiology that grew north of 25% in the quarter, we have introduced a new mapping catheter, OCTARAY, and also a new treatment catheter, QDOT. Which, as you know, Joanne, and we presented results about QDOT showing increased efficacy and procedure efficiency too.\nIf we move into vision, we are in the middle of the launch of Acuvue Oasys Max, which is doing well, and also the launch of our Tecnis Eyhance, the first monofocal intraocular lens, which is progressing also very well. Moving into orthopedics, the good news is that we have received CE Mark and CA Mark for our robotic assisted system VELYS, and we continue to have an enhanced portfolio of knees and hips with our cementless knees, the medial stabilized, and in the area of hips with hip navigation and the recent addition of Cuptimize, and we see our market position there also progressing. Moving forward, we will continue to see good evolution also in orthopedics.\nFinally, in surgery, we continue to enhance our endocutter and our energy portfolio with the launch of ENSEAL Jaw Curved and also with the launch of ECHELON 3000 in the stapler side. Overall, good reception of our new products that portend well for a continuation of growth, as I said before, in the second half of the year, and we look forward also to the different readouts of our PFA pipeline, which, as we have announced, we have completed the enrollment of our dual energy catheter, which is going to be offering the physicians the comfort of a catheter that is the most widely used with the option of having both radiofrequency and PFA to adapt to every patient anatomy, and then on the robotic side.\nWe will provide you more updates on our progress on OTTAVA, our soft tissue robotic system, before the end of the year as we committed, and we have also good news on our MONARCH system that has already started with a first patient treated in removal of kidney stones. Overall, good progress during the year. Clearly, our MedTech business is doing well, delivering competitive growth, and we have good news in innovation as the year moves forward.\n\nJoseph Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nJoanne, with respect to your second question and completing the consumer health separation, our capital allocation priorities aren't changing, so we're going to continue to invest organically in our own pipeline. You saw that we pretty much have kept our percent to sales, which leads across industries as a top 10 investor in R&D on an annual basis. You know, we prioritize that.\nWe realize that is underpinning our future success. As we have demonstrated, the dividends and the share repurchases that we've done this year have already returned a significant amount back to shareholders. We'll always be on the hunt for real good strategic opportunities that fit with either the clinical or scientific expertise we have, or commercial capabilities that we can offer that drive more value out of a potential asset in our hands than where it currently resides. We are looking feverishly as we always do across both MedTech and pharm.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just the first one is we'd love just some additional views on the $57 billion pharma target by 2025. It seems like between the pipeline progress we've seen this year and the Stelara settlements, you've had some clear positive updates over the past few months. I'm just wondering, level of confidence in that target and has that increased as we've gone through this year?\nMy second question was just for Eric on talc. Is there any update in terms of the number of plaintiffs where you have an agreement on the settlement terms relative to where we stood with the comments in April, and just where you stand right now relative to that 75% threshold you'll ultimately need. Thanks so much.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Chris. Let me start with your first question. We have always been confident on the fact that we will reach our $57 billion target by 2025, as we announced back in 2021. Certainly, what we are seeing now increases, reinforces, and enhances our confidence.\nOn one hand, you're seeing the progression of our pharmaceutical portfolio and our existing products with excellent results in DARZALEX, TREMFYA, and ERLEADA. Also, in our pulmonary hypertension franchise and in our long-acting injectable antipsychotic franchise, which are key products in this period.\nWe are very pleased with the trajectory of our new product launches, including Carvykti, Tecvayli, and Spravato. If I focus on Carvykti, you see a clear improvement quarter over quarter in Carvykti, which reflects improvements in supply.\nIn Tecvayli, you see also a clear improvement. Of note, when we look at the Tecvayli launch, align data vs. DARZALEX in the addressable patient population, Tecvayli, it's having a faster introduction. Finally, Spravato, which is doing well. Now we see Spravato as a $1 billion plus product, and you're seeing the results this quarter also reaching close to higher.\nIf we look at our pipeline and the products of the pipeline that are going to impact in this period, we are expecting the PDUFA date of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody, which is going to give another option in the treatment of multiple myeloma. We continue to progress and execute well in some of the key products in our pipeline.\nI commented on RYBREVANT and the combination of lazertinib. As you know, we received fast track designation for the three key indications of our Factor XI oral anticoagulant that we are working in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb. We presented very positive data about TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in a meeting in the American Urological Association. When it comes to Carvykti, we were very pleased to show the data on CARTITUDE-4.\nWe are filing the BLA now both in Europe and in the US, and we are expecting to show you some data on Nipocalimab in remote art. We also have already presented in hemolytic disease of the fetus of the newborn. In every angle of the products that we highlighted as the core products of our pipeline, we are executing well. Plus, we recently presented in the World Congress of Dermatology our data in our oral IL-23 receptor antagonist peptide, which show great efficacy in psoriasis.\nWe have announced plans to continue developing into psoriasis and also a phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis. Overall, when I look at the picture for 2025, you know, we have increased confidence based on our portfolio, our new product launches, and how we are executing of our pipeline.\nNow I would like to look even beyond 2025 if you allow me, Chris, because 2025 is very close. It's only three years from now. What I think is what you are seeing with this renewal of our portfolio is a very strong position for Johnson & Johnson in pharmaceuticals beyond 2025. That's something that we need to highlight. I think it's important for everybody to recognize this is going to put us in a great position beyond 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question.\n\nEric Haas\n\nVP of Litigation, Johnson & Johnson",
    "content2": "And to the question with respect to the number of claimants. Good and important question. The most recent update comes from the hearing on the motions to dismiss that finished on 30 June 2023. I would refer you to the post trial findings of fact and conclusions in law that were filed last year that really detailed the evidentiary record that was elicited during the hearing.\nBased upon that testimony that was elicited and the evidence that went in, we are now looking at approximately 60,000 claimants in support, or lawyers who represent 60,000 claimants in support of the plan, and lawyers who represent about 40,000 claimants in opposition. The numbers right now should show that the vast majority of claimants support the proposed plan. Based upon the testimony during that hearing from the lawyers that support those claimants, we are confident that that support will not waver, and we do anticipate that additional support will be coming forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nOh, hi. Thanks for questions. Just two, if I may. Thanks for your thoughts. On the talc outcome. Should we just expect any more similar suits like the one in Alameda in the near future? Then secondly, do you know, just a clarification on MARIPOSA. If another interim passed for MARIPOSA. Thanks very much.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nLet me start with the MARIPOSA. No, I mean, we are, as we communicated, we are moving into a final analysis by the end of the year, potentially presenting the data at the end of the year.\n\nEric Haas\n\nVP of Litigation, Johnson & Johnson\n\nWith respect to the talc suits now, we don't anticipate additional individual actions to go forward outside the bankruptcy. Judge Kaplan lifted the stay only with respect to that one particular case, the Valdez case. Indeed, subsequent to that, he denied a request from the same counsel to lift the stay on another case. Currently, I would not anticipate any other case to go forward in advance of a ruling on the motion to dismiss.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for all the color. I had two. I was wondering, Joaquin, you know, we've talked a lot about the myeloma market and evolution over the last decade or so. J&J has been a leader there. This is a $20 billion market. You obviously have a number of different options now for patients, including Tecvayli most recently and Talquetamab with the upcoming PDUFA date.\nSo I guess my question is just top down, you know, what prevents you from capturing a majority share of that $20 billion market? And then Joe, question for you on margins post Kenvue, any early idea you can give us in terms of how that structure could evolve post the full separation. Thank you.\n\nJoseph Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYes. So thank you for the question. And the answer is nothing prevents us from doing that. As a matter of fact, our aspiration in myeloma is that with the portfolio that we have today with Darzalex, Tecvayli, Talquetamab, and Carvykti, we would be in a position to have three out of every four patients starting in a Janssen containing JET regimen by the end of this decade. So that's our aspiration in myeloma. Our aspiration is that there is such a regimen for every line of therapy and adjacent treatment for every patient, irrespective of their characteristics. And that's the way we are planning our development.\nYou know, certainly Darzalex being a backbone of therapy, first line and also in combination with multiple agents and then sequencing into Carvykti, Antarctic, Talquetamab, and Tecvayli, which we are studying in combination with Darzalex and also in combination among each other and sequencing among them.\nSo ultimately our goal when it comes to multiple myeloma is to be able to sequence our medicines, combine them in a way that we are changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression, to treat to cure. And that is a big, big, big plus in our portfolio. And as I have commented often, multiple myeloma is the core of our pharmaceutical franchise and the number one growth driver that is going to be for 2025 and beyond.\nThere's more factors that give us optimism about the business potential of this area, is that as we combine and as we sequence treatments, the treatment duration itself is going to be significantly increased. So we overall foresee great patient and growth opportunity as we look to combine all these modalities, as I said, in order to be able to convert multiple myeloma into a chronic disease.\nTerence, thanks for the question regarding margins and specifically, I think you're getting at the heart of the potential, potential deleverage that could occur with the separation once Kenvue is on its own entirely. You may recall a couple quarters ago on one of these calls we said that there was potentially $500 million to $750 million of deleverage in SG&A. We embarked on an initiative and I guess the benchmarks would suggest companies usually take about two to three years to get those costs out of their system.\nLast summer, we really embarked on a project to eliminate those costs on a much faster cadence. I would say of that $500 to 750 million, there's a small fraction that may remain, and we're still working to eliminate that. You should expect, as you're modeling, no deleveraging or very, very little deleveraging from the Kenvue separation.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. Just to follow up on some of the capital allocation commentary, Joe, I appreciate what you're saying that things haven't changed, but I'm just curious, now that you guys have integrated Abiomed, you're seeing some success there, how your appetite for specifically within medical devices and med tech, how your appetite for potentially larger deals may have changed?\nAnd are there any specific areas you would call out within cardiology now that you do have Abiomed or just with, you know, throughout medical devices as areas of interest or where you feel underscaled and you might benefit from building out there? Thanks so much.\n\nJoseph Wolk\n\nEVP and CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah. Good to speak with you, Danielle. I know you directed the question to me and I'll answer it with one word. I would say our appetite is pretty voracious at this point, but I'll leave it to Joaquin. With respect to the size of the deals, I don't think it unequivocally doesn't change whether it's big or small. It has to be a really good strategic fit utilizing the expertise and capabilities that we have. And it has to provide financial value. What can. Maybe you want to comment on any specific areas that are of interest?\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYeah. Thank you, Danielle. Before I go there, let me say that the Abiomed integration is progressing really well. The growth of Abiomed, it's been 20% for the quarter, and we continue to move forward with enrollment in the key PMA studies, PROTECT and STEMI DTU, as well as the Impella ECP.\nSo everything is moving well, according to plan in the Abiomed integration. And we are increasingly convinced that this is going to be a key component of our MedTech strategy in becoming a leader in heart recovery. So when it comes to M&A, we continue to look for opportunities. And our number one criteria in looking for opportunities is the medical innovation, how they improve patient care, how do we see the science behind the product?\nSo we are agnostic in that sense to MedTech and pharmaceuticals; it's all about identifying areas that are going to have a significant impact in patient care. When it comes to MedTech, certainly, as we have commented, we are continuing to look forward for opportunities to grow into areas that are close to where we are today: vision, cardiovascular, obviously surgery too, and also opportunities in certain high-growth segments of orthopedics.\nYou know, we normally will continue to look for opportunities trying to have a good return on capital as well as things that are close to our existing expertise. When it comes to pharma, our history in tuck-ins, in-license, and collaborations has been very successful. As a matter of fact, external innovation represents about 50% of our pipeline.\nYou know, while we will continue to look for opportunities like we have done now with cellular biomedicine and the agreement that we have doing CAR T, we are not averse to other transactions of larger size. Evidently, both in MedTech and in pharma, we are very distinct with our capital allocation, and all our transactions will have to clear certain financial milestones for us to be able to move on. But M&A and also licensing, acquisition of collaboration operations remains a key factor in our growth moving forward.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks. We have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now live.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHi. Congratulations on the quarter, and thank you for taking my questions here. I wanted to ask you where your latest thoughts on IRA are and the potential impact to the drug industry and also to J&J. Second question was just on Carvykti. Just curious how you expect to expand into earlier lines of treatment and then more widely into the community. Thank you.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nYes. So let me start with the IRA. Obviously we remain very concerned about the government price setting environment that the IRA creates, which we believe creates a significant disincentive to innovation, without addressing the core problem, which is patient access.\nSo it is a significant concern for us. And that's one of the reasons, as Eric commented earlier, that we have filed a lawsuit versus the IRA. So that's important for us. Then when it comes to the actual business impact, I think it's still early to be able to calculate it given the fact that many of the rules and procedures are still in flux.\nSo it would be too much to be able to try to anticipate that in our case, when we look at Johnson & Johnson, relatively speaking, towards the industry based on our diversification between MedTech and pharma, and also the diversification of our pharma portfolio. We feel that we are well positioned competitively to continue to grow well beyond the second half of this decade. So we remain concerned, but at the same time we think we are prepared to be able to manage successfully any situation coming from that relative to other industry players.\nThe second question was about Carvykti. As I commented earlier, we are working to improve Carvykti supply, which is very important. You've seen that improvement in our sales in the quarter. We are working in different ways. One is we are increasing capacity. We have internalized the production of lentivirus now. And also we are in the process of increasing the number of slots internally.\nAnd also we have reached agreements with other companies like Novartis to continue to increase capacity. So we are going to be in that trajectory of increasing capacity gradually in order to be able to eventually meet the demand that exists in Carvykti. As far as reaching to other patient populations, the CARTITUDE-4, it's already been filed and it's moving Carvykti into earlier lines of therapy.\nAnd we are also working in first line with Carvykti-5 and Carvykti, excuse me, with CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6. So we are clearly intending to move Carvykti through CARTITUDE-4, CARTITUDE-5, and CARTITUDE-6 into early lines of therapy. And we are increasingly convinced of the potential of Carvykti to be one of our more than $5 billion assets that we announced back in 2021.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Louise. Thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call back over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nChairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess, and thank you to all of you for joining this call today. I'm extremely proud of the performance that we have achieved on the first half of 2023. We are entering the back half of the year from a position of strength with numerous catalysts, including the fact that we are going to be a two sector company focused on pharmaceutical, MedTech, recent development, and innovation. We look forward to having future engagements with you to update you on our continued progress. Thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 first quarter business results and full year financial outlook.\nJoining me on today's call are Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman of MedTech. Unfortunately, Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals, is not feeling well and is unable to join us today.\nA few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nPlease note that today's meeting contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.\nMoving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the 3 segments. Joe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes.\nNow let's turn to our first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $24.7 billion for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.6% versus the first quarter of 2022. Operational sales, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9% as currency had a negative impact of 3.4 points.\nIn the U.S., sales increased 9.7%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales increased 1.8%. Operational sales outside the U.S. increased 8.3% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 6.5 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide, 7.4% in the U.S. and 7.9% outside the U.S. with all 3 segments growing sequentially over the fourth quarter.\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net loss was $68 million, and basic loss per share was $0.03 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.93 1 year ago primarily driven by the $6.9 billion charge related to the talc settlement proposal. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.68, representing a decrease of 0.9% and an increase of 0.4%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%.\nI will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2022 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.\nBeginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.9 billion increased 7.4% with an increase of 11.4% in the U.S. and an increase of 4.4% outside the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 11.3%. And outside the U.S., operational sales increased 11.3%. Results were primarily driven by global strategic price increases across all franchises.\nVolume growth in OTC was due to an exceptionally strong cough, cold and flu season most pronounced in Europe coupled with some onetime retailer restocking primarily in the U.S. related to low inventory levels due to tripledemic demand. Skin Health/Beauty delivered double-digit growth driven by price actions lapping prior year supply constraints and current quarter restocking as well as strong NEUTROGENA and AVEENO e-commerce and club channel performance and new product innovations.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.4 billion increased 4.2% with growth of 5.9% in the U.S. and 2.4% outside of the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 7.2%. And outside the U.S., operational sales increased 8.6%. Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales increased 4.9%. U.S. operational sales increased 7.1%, and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 2.4%.\nPharmaceutical growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products with 8 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 25.7% and 40.3%, respectively.\nSTELARA grew 9.6% driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with gains of 2.2 points and 4.8 points in the U.S., respectively, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and price. TREMFYA grew 11% driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with gains of 0.9 points and 2.1 points in the U.S., respectively, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix.\nTurning to newly launched products. We are excited to disclose CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO sales for the first time this quarter. We continue to make progress on our thoughtful and phased launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO. Also, we are encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology.\nThis sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide.\nI'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased by 7.3% with growth of 16.6% in the U.S. and a decline of 0.6% outside of the U.S.\nWorldwide operational sales increased 11%. And outside the U.S., operational sales increased 6.2%.\nAbiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6.4%.\nSales in the first quarter accelerated sequentially from Q4 for all 4 MedTech businesses driven by global procedure growth, continued uptake of recently launched products and commercial execution. As anticipated, in China, procedure volumes improved as the quarter progressed. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume-based procurement in China as well as supply constraints.\nThe Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 41.9%, which includes $324 million related to Abiomed. We are excited about the progress of the integration to which Joe will provide additional context. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, this franchise delivered another quarter of double-digit worldwide growth at 12.3%.\nAs we continue to increase our reporting transparency, beginning this quarter, we are providing visibility to electrophysiology sales. Electrophysiology continued to deliver double-digit sales growth in all regions with the exception of Asia Pacific, which reflects impacts related to volume-based procurement in China.\nOrthopaedics operational growth of 5.1% reflects the strong procedure recovery and success of recently launched products especially digital and enabling technologies driving pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China, primarily in hips and spine.\nGlobal growth of 9.3% in contact lens and other reflects continued penetration of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and strategic price actions. Growth in contact lens and U.S. surgical vision was tempered by continued supply challenges.\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 150 basis points driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit-related costs in the Pharmaceutical business and commodity inflation and acquisition-related items in the MedTech business.\nSelling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 60 basis points driven by proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.4% of sales this quarter. The $3.6 billion invested was a 2.9% increase versus the prior year.\nThe other income and expense line was an expense of $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to net income of $100 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in expense was the result of the $6.9 billion charge related to the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023 as previously disclosed.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 90.8% versus 12.2% in the same period last year primarily driven by the $6.9 billion accrual for the talc settlement proposal. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 13.3% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.\nNow let's look at the adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 35.1% to 34.2%. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 44.1% to 43.2% driven primarily by mix, partially offset by proactive management of costs. MedTech margins remained flat at 27% driven primarily by inflationary impacts, offset by proactive management of costs. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 22.1% to 22.3% driven primarily by strategic price actions, partially offset by input cost inflation.\nThis concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter 2023 results. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess, and thank you all for joining today's call. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operational performance across our business. The results reflect the strength and versatility of Johnson & Johnson and our commitment to improving health care outcomes around the world.\n2023 has many important catalysts that can drive meaningful near- and long-term value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders. We remain focused on the successful separation of our Consumer Health business, Kenvue, which will position both companies to be more agile, focused and competitive. We are also expecting a number of pipeline advancements that will provide increased confidence in our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses.\nOur Pharmaceutical segment delivered a strong first quarter. Growth from our Pharmaceutical business continues to be driven by key assets in our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as uptake from new launches such as SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI.\n2023 is an important year of scientific innovation for our Pharmaceutical business. And in Q1, we announced that CARVYKTI, our BCMA cell therapy, met its primary endpoint in the CARTITUDE-4 study, a Phase III trial in multiple myeloma patients who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. We look forward to presenting these results in an upcoming major medical meeting.\nAdditionally, our partners at Protagonist Therapeutics announced positive top line results from the Phase IIb Frontier 1 study of our oral IL-23 in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We look forward to sharing this data and future development plans at an upcoming medical meeting.\nFinally, as we continually review our portfolio to prioritize the most transformational assets for ongoing investment and an assessment of the RSV vaccine landscape, the company made the decision to discontinue its investigational RSV adult vaccine program. This decision is part of a broader effort to make strategic choices for our pipeline and R&D investments to focus on medicines with the greatest potential benefit to patients.\nLooking at the rest of the year, we expect important data from key pipeline assets such as Nipocalimab and TREMFYA as well as the potential approval of Talquetamab. Importantly, I want to mention 2 additional highlights. First, the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer remains on track with the potential for final analysis later in the year.\nWe are also excited to present data from the SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200 in muscle invasive bladder cancer at the American Urological Association's Annual Meeting this month, which demonstrated a promising complete risks and safety profile.\nRegarding our Pharmaceutical business, I'd like to reiterate some comments I recently made at the Cowen Investor Conference in March related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the impact on the 2025 Pharmaceutical sales goal the team put forth during the 2021 Investor Day. While we don't speculate on currency, based on the current rates, the 2025 sales target of $60 billion is approximately $57 billion on a constant currency basis.\nIn 2022 alone, FX had a negative impact of roughly $3 billion in Pharmaceuticals. While that is the math qualitatively since 2021, a number of things have changed in our portfolio. On the plus side, we've seen acceleration of some current and potential upcoming launches like TECVAYLI and Talquetamab. But to be balanced, we've also experienced competitive pressure on IMBRUVICA above what was anticipated in 2021. So many push and pulls, but we are striving to attain our operational goals. We are confident in our ability to exceed 2025 estimates The Street has out there today of approximately $54 billion.\nMedTech delivered a strong quarter of sales growth. We continued to advance key pipeline programs. For example, within our electrophysiology business, we reached a few milestones this quarter related to our pulse field ablation pipeline programs, including the European clinical study Inspire, which achieved early success by meeting both primary safety and efficacy endpoints.\nAdditionally, we announced completion of the first procedures in the European Smartfire clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of our investigational dual energy catheter, which combines both pulse field and Radiofrequency ablation capabilities. As you know, we continue to prioritize investment in high-growth areas, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Abiomed, which closed this past December.\nWith Abiomed, MedTech now has 12 platforms with over $1 billion annual sales. While it is still early days, we are pleased with the integration and performance of Abiomed. Patient utilization of Abiomed technologies grew mid- to high teens in both Europe and the United States and over 30% in Japan.\nWe continue to see strong adoption of newer technologies, such as Impella 5.5, and we achieved record quarterly enrollment in both the STEMI DTU and PROTECT 4 pivotal trials as we continue to advance efforts in pursuit of Class I guidelines.\nFor perspective, operational sales growth compared to the same quarter last year reported by Abiomed as a standalone company was 22%. In Orthopaedics, just this month, we obtained CE Mark for the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution, positioning us to expand our international footprint with this differentiated solution in total knee.\nFinally, the MedTech team is excited by the progress being made in regards to the Ottawa general surgery robotic solution, and we remain on track to share more information in the second half of this year.\nOur Consumer Health business delivered double-digit first quarter sales growth driven by strategic price actions, strong demand and some stock replenishment. We remain on track to complete the separation of this business in 2023, assuming accommodative market conditions.\nSince the start of the year, we have been operating our Consumer Health business as a company within a company and continue to update our Form S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the opportunity to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the separation. Standup cost and stranded costs remain consistent with what we have stated previously with an active program well underway to reduce the stranded costs.\nTurning to notable enterprise events. I'd like to briefly touch LTL's refiling for bankruptcy on April 4. Neither LTL's original filing nor this refiling is an acknowledgment of wrongdoing nor an indication that the company has changed its long-standing position that its talcum powder products are safe. Our goal continues to be for an equitable and efficient resolution of the cosmetic talc litigation against the company, and we believe this refiling represents progress towards that goal.\nAs a reminder, LTL's bankruptcy filing will not have an impact upon the Kenvue separation, and the talc liabilities in the United States and Canada will remain with Johnson & Johnson. As part of the refiling, we have proposed a reorganization plan that had significant support from claimants and includes a payment of $8.9 billion in present value over a 25-year period. LTL will continue to work through the process set forth by the bankruptcy court and expects to present the reorganization plan to the court in mid-May.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And in 2022, we successfully executed against all pillars. R&D investment remains our #1 priority and driver of long-term growth and value creation. We know the value our investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.3% increase, marking our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases.\nIn addition, we continuously evaluate strategic business development opportunities that enable Johnson & Johnson to create value for patients, customers and shareholders. Our final priority is share repurchase programs when appropriate. In fact, this past quarter, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program announced late last year.\nWe are confident in our strong financial position, including our AAA-rated balance sheet and our ability to deploy capital across all strategic priorities. We believe this strength differentiates Johnson & Johnson and enables us to pull the appropriate levers to set us up for long-term success.\nMoving on to our full year 2023 guidance for the enterprise. Based on our strong start to the year, we are pleased to raise our guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 up 1 percentage point in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% or up $1 billion in a range of $97.9 billion to $98.9 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth up 1 percentage point in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%.\nOur sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at 1.08. The euro spot rate as of late last week was 1.10. We continue to estimate there would be minimal impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year as the dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies.\nWe are maintaining the guidance we provided in January for our adjusted pretax operating margin, other income and expense, interest expense and tax rate. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 per share and tightening the range to $10.50 to $10.60 or $10.55 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3.5% to 4.5% or 4% at the midpoint.\nWhile not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share. This favorable currency impact, coupled with our strong operational outlook, results in an increase to our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year by $0.10 per share and tightening the range to $10.60 to $10.70 or $10.65 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of approximately 4.5% to 5.5% or 5% at the midpoint.\nWhile we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. In Pharmaceuticals, we maintain our expectation of delivering above-market growth in 2023 driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. This growth considers the potential composition of matter patent expiry of STELARA, which we currently assume will occur in late 2023 in the United States.\nFurther, we continue to expect 2023 impact from other post-LOE products, including REMICADE, ZYTIGA and XEPLION as well as increased austerity measures across Europe. Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we do not anticipate material sales beyond that which were recorded in the first quarter as our contractual commitments are complete.\nIn MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by increased procedures and commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate relatively stable procedure volumes and health care staffing levels for the remainder of the year with normal seasonality.\nRegarding quarterly phasing, given the strength of our first quarter results, we now expect relatively consistent performance throughout the year from our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. When modeling Consumer Health growth rates in 2023, it is important to take into consideration prior year comparisons as well as the robust cough, cold and flu season and the onetime restocking that occurred in the first quarter. As a reminder, the first half of 2022 was impacted by supply constraints.\nA few brief announcements before we take your questions. Continuing our efforts to increase our transparency and assist with your modeling, we are planning to post a patent table, including U.S. pharmaceutical patents, to our investor website in the quarter.\nIn addition, please mark your calendars for December 5 as we will be hosting an enterprise business review at the New York Stock Exchange focused on the new Johnson & Johnson, highlighting both our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. We will provide additional details about the event in the coming months.\nBefore we turn to your questions, let me state how proud we are regarding our team's continued hard work and unwavering commitment. Our sights are set on the future, focused on delivering competitive growth for the new Johnson & Johnson. We are confident that our current plans position us for near-term success, long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question?",

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGood morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and our financial outlook for 2023.\nJoining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.\nA few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nPlease note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements related to, among other things, the company's future financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's consumer health business. You're cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nIn particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website.\nAdditionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.\nMoving to today's agenda. Joaquin will open with a few comments highlighting his first year as CEO and his priorities for 2023. I will then review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the 3 segments as well as full year 2022 results for the enterprise. Joe will then close with additional business commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and our guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 75 minutes.\nI am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nCEO & Chairman, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Jess. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our 2022 results and highlight my priorities for the business.\nI'm excited for the future of Johnson & Johnson. For over 135 years, people have counted on Johnson & Johnson to be at the forefront of health care innovation. This remains as true today as the day we were founded, and I'm honored to continue this legacy.\nIn 2022, despite macroeconomic challenges, we delivered full year operational growth of over 6%. This is the result of the dedication and focus of our employees around the world as well as the breadth and diversification of our business.\nThere were many business achievements last year. Let me share some highlights. Our pharmaceutical team achieved its 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, delivering nearly 7% growth as we continue to advance our innovation pipeline.\nI'm particularly excited about the progress made across our multiple myeloma portfolio. This includes the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy, and TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, along with the recent filing of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific.\nIn MedTech, we generated above 6% full year operational growth, anticipating our second consecutive year, outperforming our competitive composite. In terms of innovation, we accelerated the cadence of new product launches and significantly enhanced the quality of our MedTech pipeline, including more than doubling the number of programs with over $100 million of net present value potential.\nNotably, we completed the acquisition of Abiomed, which positions us as the global leader in heart recovery and immediately enhances MedTech revenue growth. This transaction will become accretive to earnings in 2024.\nFinally, we made significant progress towards the separation of Kenvue. We have begun operating our consumer business as a company within a company, and we filed our Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us the option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the separation.\nLooking ahead, while we expect some of the headwinds that impacted 2022 to continue, we have proven that Johnson & Johnson is resilient in times of macroeconomic challenges. In this environment, our approach to 2023 can be best described as prudent, and our priorities for the year are clear and remain consistent.\nFirst, we are finalizing our plans for Johnson & Johnson to operate as a 2-sector company, dedicated to competitive performance, both in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. This change will enable us to become simpler, faster and more focused.\nIn Pharmaceutical, we will continue delivering top line growth annually, while driving towards $60 billion in revenue by 2025. We believe we will be able to achieve above market growth in 2023 for the 12th consecutive year, even in the face of the STELARA loss of exclusivity and macroeconomic challenges.\nGrowth will be driven primarily by our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI and also continued uptake from new launches, including SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI.\nIn MedTech, with the acquisition of Abiomed, we now have 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to build on 2022's momentum. We will do this by maximizing the commercial opportunity for recently launched innovations, continuing to advance the Abiomed pipeline and prioritizing investment in higher growth segments of our markets.\nThis will be a transformational year for Johnson & Johnson, which brings me to my next priority, completing the successful creation of a new consumer health company, Kenvue. We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023, as indicated in our initial announcement in November of 2021.\nAs we look forward, our track record gives us the confidence that we can grow ahead of our peers and cement the foundation for long-term success. Following 2021, a year where we substantially increased R&D investment, we continue our commitment to organic innovation. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&D during 2022.\nAlso we increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year. We instituted a share repurchase, and we deployed over $17 billion in M&A, including the acquisition of Abiomed. Very few companies have the capability and the balance sheet to take such significant actions concurrently, especially in a year like 2022. I'm confident that we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond.\nIn closing, I am energized about what is to come. As the largest and most diversified health care products company in the world, we will continue to use our scale and breadth to drive innovations, deliver for patients and shape the future of health care around the world.\nNow let me turn it back to Jess.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Joaquin.\nStarting with Q4 2022 sales results. Worldwide sales were $23.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 4.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 0.9%, as currency had a negative impact of 5.3 points.\nIn the U.S., sales increased 2.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 11.5%. Operational sales outside the U.S. declined 1.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 10.4 points.\nExcluding sales from the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 4.6% worldwide, 4.7% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedule, acquisitions and divestitures had an immaterial impact on our results in the quarter.\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.77 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.2 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.35, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.5%.\nFor the full year 2022, consolidated sales were $94.9 billion, an increase of 1.3% compared to the full year of 2021. Operationally, full year sales grew 6.1%, with currency having a negative impact of 4.8 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 3%.\nIn regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales declined 0.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. grew by 9.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 9.7 points. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedules, acquisition and divestitures as well as sales from our COVID-19 vaccine had an immaterial impact on our results for the full year.\nNet earnings for the full year 2022 were $17.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $6.73 versus diluted earnings per share of $7.81 a year ago. 2022 adjusted net earnings were $27 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.15, representing increases of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, versus full year 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2%.\nWhile not part of our prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional information and backup for our full year 2022 sales by segment, consolidated statement of earnings and adjusted income before tax by segment, which can be downloaded from our website.\nI will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2021 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.\nBeginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion increased 1%, with an increase of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 5.8% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 6.4%, and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 3.2%.\nResults were primarily driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cough, cold and flu season and growth in NEUTROGENA as well as strong new product introductions in Asia Pacific and Latin America. NEUTROGENA growth contributed to the second consecutive quarter of 5% operational growth for Skin Health Beauty. Growth across the portfolio was partially offset by continued, although reduced, supply constraints in the U.S., COVID-19 impacts in China, portfolio simplification and the suspension of personal care product sales in Russia.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion decreased 7.4%, with declines of 0.6% in the U.S. and 14.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales declined 2.5%, and outside the U.S. operational sales declined 4.5%.\nExcluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 3.9%, U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.4%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 6%. Pharmaceutical growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth for the 11th consecutive year, including 7 assets with double-digit growth.\nGrowth was driven by DARZALEX, ERLEADA, STELARA and TREMFYA and was partially offset by REMICADE and ZYTIGA due to loss of exclusivity, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales.\nWithin our Oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continue to drive strong sales growth, with increases of 33.9% and 48.6%, respectively. ZYTIGA sales declined 43.6% worldwide predominantly due to loss of exclusivity in Europe in September. IMBRUVICA sales declined 12.3% worldwide due to competitive pressures and a suppressed CLL market due to COVID-19. Despite competitive pressures, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide.\nIn our immunology business, STELARA grew 6.2% driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 4 points and 5.4 points in the U.S., respectively, as well as a favorable prior period adjustment, impacting worldwide results by approximately 460 basis points. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and rebating in the U.S. as well as austerity measures in Europe and shipment timing in Asia Pacific.\nTREMFYA grew 12.5% driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 1.4 points and 2.9 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. Q4 growth was partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 1,150 basis points, unfavorable patient mix and a challenging prior year comparison.\nBeginning in Q1 2023, we anticipate that CARVYKTI, currently reported in other oncology, and SPRAVATO, currently reported in other neuroscience, will meet the threshold to be separately disclosed.\nI'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion decreased by 1.2%, with growth of 7.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 8.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.9%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.9%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 4.4%.\nQ4 growth was driven by commercial execution, strong new product introduction performance as well as COVID-19 procedure recovery in many parts of the world. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume-based procurement, COVID resurgence in China as well as supply constraints, predominantly in vision.\nStrong growth continued in the U.S., with dollar sales sequentially improving each quarter throughout 2022. OUS performance was adversely impacted by dynamics related to COVID-19, especially given our strong position in China.\nThe Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 15.1% driven primarily by strong new product introductions performance, commercial execution and continued market growth in electrophysiology. Abiomed sales are also reported in Interventional Solutions, and financial results were reflected as of December 22, the date the acquisition closed.\nContact lens global growth of 7.7% reflects strong performance of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and market appropriate price actions. Growth was tempered by continued supply challenges.\nIn the Orthopedics franchise, digital and enabling technologies reported in spine, sports and other continued to accelerate and drive pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees.\nFor additional context, selling days had approximately a 60 basis points positive impact on results in the quarter.\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing related costs, unfavorable currency impact in the Pharmaceutical business, inflationary pressures as well as unfavorable mix with the enterprise, with a lower portion of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business.\nSelling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 150 basis points. This represents a 9% reduction versus the prior year driven by phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year as well as proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment.\nWe continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 16.2% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was an 18.6% reduction versus the prior year driven primarily by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year.\nInterest income was favorable to prior year by just over $100 million driven by higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing related exit costs, higher consumer health separation related costs, higher costs related to the Abiomed acquisition and lower gains on securities.\nAs we announced in Q2 2022, we continue to have commitments and obligations related to the COVID-19 vaccine, including external manufacturing network exit cost and required clinical trial expenses associated with the company's modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 2.1% in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by more income in higher tax jurisdictions versus the prior year.\nAdditionally, the company benefited from onetime tax items in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in the current year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 10.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2022 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.\nNow let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 25.6% to 31.3%. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 33.9% to 38.2% primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, partially offset by the negative impact of currency and cost of products sold.\nMedTech margins improved from 18.1% to 25.3% primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, favorable portfolio mix and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures.\nFinally, Consumer Health margins improved from 18.6% to 22% driven by brand marketing phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures.\nThis concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.\nAs Jess shared, we reported solid results with competitive growth across our business segments in 2022. While macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-19 related impacts tempered our fourth quarter sales growth, we prioritized our top investments, while managing costs to yield slightly better margin performance than guided in October to meet our earnings expectations. The business is resilient, and we should be positioned well entering 2023.\nWe are particularly proud of the advancements in our pipeline and portfolio to solidify the long term, including the launch of TECVAYLI, the filing of talquetamab in the U.S. and Europe, FDA clearance for our TELIGEN digital spine solution, the closing of the Abiomed acquisition and the tremendous progress made on separating our Consumer Health business.\nLet's delve into the financials beginning with our 2022 year-end cash position and execution against our capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of approximately $17 billion. And at the end of 2022, we had approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $40 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we had a strong year deploying capital against all of our capital allocation priorities. These priorities remain unchanged.\nThis past year, we invested more than 15% of sales for a total of nearly $15 billion in research and development. This investment has enabled the advancement of important programs, including strengthening our MedTech pipeline and progression of our multiple myeloma portfolio, which Joaquin referenced. Investment in R&D remains a top priority to support long-term growth and value creation.\nOur second priority is our commitment to dividends. 2022 marked the 60th consecutive year in which we increased our annual dividend. We know investors value our dividend. And as a part of the Consumer Health separation, we intend, at a minimum, to maintain that dividend. As you can appreciate, we will need more clarity on the type of separation to determine how that is best achieved.\nOur third priority is strategic acquisitions, which is intended to complement our organic activities. In 2022, we closed the acquisition of Abiomed, strengthening MedTech's presence in higher growth segments, as well as more than 100 smaller early-stage acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships.\nFinally, our Board authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter. And as of the end of the year, we've completed approximately 50% of that program. In combination with our dividend, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in 2022.\nI'll now provide our full year 2023 guidance. As we are still in the process of the Kenvue separation, our guidance represents the current Johnson & Johnson businesses, inclusive of Pharmaceuticals, MedTech and Consumer Health segments.\nWe expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage business performance.\nWe estimate a favorable impact from net acquisitions and divestitures associated primarily with the Abiomed acquisition and, thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%.\nOur sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, which, as your models already correctly anticipate, will decline in 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, we estimate there would be no impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year.\nRegarding other items on our P&L, we expect 2023 adjusted pretax operating margin to be flat driven by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold, offset by continued operating expense leverage.\nRegarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs as well as gains and losses related to items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and balance sheet write-offs. On an adjusted basis, we expect this to be $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for 2023.\nThe majority of this income is associated with our employee benefits programs aligned with accounting disclosure requirements. Rising interest rates, return on assets and program actions the team has implemented to de-risk the plans have lowered our projected future benefit obligations. And based on current trends, we expect this benefit to continue through the next couple of years.\nWe are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $250 million and $350 million. These figures include increased financing charges versus 2022 associated with the Abiomed acquisition.\nFinally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2023 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses.\nConsidering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.60 on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 2.5% to 4.5% or 3.5% at the midpoint.\nWhile not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.45 to $10.65 or $10.55 at the midpoint, growth of 4% versus the prior year.\nWhile we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. Some segment remarks starting with Pharmaceuticals. We expect to again deliver above-market growth in 2023 driven by key assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as continued uptake of recently launched products, such as CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO and TECVAYLI. This growth is despite lower pharmaceutical market growth than experienced in recent years and considers the STELARA loss of exclusivity, which we anticipate occurring in late 2023 in the U.S.\nWhile we continue to expect volume growth for STELARA in the U.S. up to the LOE date, we expect this growth to be offset by pricing pressure. Further, we continue to expect a 2023 impact from other post-LOE products as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe.\nIn MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by market recovery and continued commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate a relatively stable recovery in procedure volumes, with health care staffing constraints remaining the most significant limitation on the pace of recovery.\nSpecific to China, we anticipate continued pressure into 2023 related to the easing of the zero-COVID policies as well as impacts from volume-based procurement. As we've said, we're excited about the Abiomed acquisition, which accelerates our sales growth in 2023.\nIn Consumer Health, we anticipate continued growth in line with the markets that we compete in. We also expect to continue to utilize strategic price increases across the portfolio to minimize the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures within the supply chain.\nRegarding quarterly phasing, it's best summed up with a general theme that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half, and likely the second quarter stronger than the first quarter. We are assuming the following to support these statements.\nIn Pharmaceuticals, the first half of the year will be impacted by continued declines from LOE products in Europe that impacted Q4 2022 results, namely ZYTIGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, as well as continued pricing pressure. Also we expect the ramp of new product launches will occur more prominently in the second half of the year.\nIn MedTech, we expect second half operational sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year, as we anticipate ongoing procedure recovery to improve as the year progresses. We also believe that some of the COVID impact felt in China in Q4 will carry over into early 2023. And similar to Pharmaceuticals, uptake of new product launches is assumed to be more pronounced in the second half.\nGiven we are in the registration process, regulations limit what we can currently discuss around the planned Consumer Health company.\nOn the P&L, we also anticipate operating margin to be better in the second half than the first half. This is attributable to inventory built in 2022 at higher costs driven by inflation that will flow through the P&L in the first half of 2023 and a second half that accounts for cost leverage driven by mitigation efforts and higher sales reflected in the comments I just made.\nAnd finally, while we don't speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08, as well as other currencies, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on our results in the first half of the year, but potentially a favorable impact in the second half.\nTurning to key events in 2023. As mentioned, we are limited in the information we can provide around the planned Consumer Health separation. We publicly filed a Form S-1 on January 4th with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the option to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the planned separation, and we have started to operate Kenvue as a company within a company.\nConsistent with our initial announcement in November of 2021, we continue to expect to complete the separation in 2023. And we expect that any interim steps, such as an IPO, would be consistent with that timing, subject to market conditions.\nWe are estimating $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in after-tax Kenvue standup costs, with $1.2 billion having already been incurred through the end of 2022. These estimates are in line with industry average for transactions such as this one given Johnson & Johnson's market cap.\nIn terms of dis-synergies to be incurred following the completion of the separation, we are estimating between $500 million and $750 million of annual after-tax impact. We are already executing on plans to address these dis-synergies and expect to have them fully mitigated by the end 2024.\nAs we separate a new Johnson & Johnson, we'll also continue to reevaluate the level of ongoing financial information provided based on discussions with investors. While our financials will become simpler as we move from a 3-segment company to a 2-segment company, we will continue to look for ways to enhance our disclosures, such as providing quarterly R&D by segment and a patent expiry table in our Form 10-K.\nWe also expect 2023 to be an important year of scientific innovations and readouts across our segments. In our Pharmaceutical business, some examples include the potential approval of talquetamab, our GPRC5D-CD3 bispecific antibody in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; potential clinical data from CARTITUDE-4, a trial studying CARVYKTI or BCMA CAR-T in patients with 1 to 3 lines of prior therapy.\nThe potential for an interim analysis of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations versus TAGRISSO as well as potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy.\nEarly clinical data from the Phase II SunRIS-1 study of TAR-200, our drug eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Starting Phase III clinical program for milvexian, a Factor XI anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb.\nPotential Phase II clinical data from nipocalimab, our FcRn antagonist in rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.\nPotential Phase 3 clinical data from TREMFYA in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. And finally, TREMFYA, our IL-23 inhibitor, was recently added to the National Reimbursement Drug list in China, which will take effect later this year.\nIn MedTech, we look forward to providing information on significant innovation programs across the business, including expansion of our digital solutions in orthopedics; our digital robotic solution, OTTAVA; our pulse field ablation solutions for cardiac ablation; and advancements in our pipeline and clinical studies for heart recovery associated with Abiomed.\nOverall, our approach to 2023 financial guidance should be viewed as responsibly cautious given the many external uncertainties. We are focused on delivering competitive growth for the new Johnson & Johnson, while also completing a successful Consumer Health separation. We are confident that our current plans position us for long-term growth and value creation for shareholders.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. I am now pleased to open the line for your questions. (Operator Instructions).",

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nPlease note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the company's future financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. You're cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nIn particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website.\nAdditionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. These clients acknowledge those relationships.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGood morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. In addition to today's presentation and associated schedules, we will be posting the transcript of today's call as well as an Excel version of key financial schedules.\nI will now review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the 3 segments. Joe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes.\nNow let's move to the third quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.8 billion for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 1.9% versus the third quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 8.1% as currency had a negative impact of 6.2 points.\nIn the U.S., sales increased 4.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 0.3%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.3%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 12.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 8.2% worldwide, 4.2% in the U.S. and 12.4% outside the U.S.\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.68 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.37 1 year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.55, representing decreases of 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5.8%.\nI will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2021 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Continuing with the streamlined remarks shared in the prior 2 quarters, we plan to keep our comments brief to leave more time for Q&A. Please refer to the slides for additional segment and franchise commentary.\nBeginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion decreased 0.4%, with an increase of 2.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.7% and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 6.7%.\nExcluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 4.8%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cold, cough and flu season and OUS growth in NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to market growth and new product launches. This growth was partially offset by supply constraints in the U.S. and suspension of sales of personal care products in Russia.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion increased 2.6%, with growth of 3% in the U.S. and 2% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 9%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 16.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 9.2%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.9%, U.S. operational sales growth increased 7%, and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 11.3%.\nPharmaceutical growth was driven by strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including five assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA as well as our paliperidone long-acting portfolio, and was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales.\nWithin our Oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth with increases of 38.7% and 51.2%, respectively. IMBRUVICA sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competitive pressures. In the U.S., the CLL market remains below pre-COVID levels, while in the EU, results were negatively impacted by government clawbacks. Overall, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide.\nIn our Immunology business, TREMFYA grew 41.9%, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 3.2 points and 1.7 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. STELARA growth of 8% was driven by strong market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with gains of 5.2 points and 6.9 points in the U.S., respectively. Results in the quarter were partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment of approximately 600 basis points on worldwide growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022.\nI'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion increased by 2.1% with growth of 7.7% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.1%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 8.5%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.1%.\nDrivers for growth across MedTech include procedure recovery as well as focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products such as ENSEAL X1 devices in Energy; VELYS digital solutions across our Orthopaedic platforms; and additional solutions enhancing our industry-leading electrophysiology portfolio. Based on our most recent share data, we continue to enhance or sustain market share positions in the large majority of our 11 priority platforms. As a reminder, these 11 platforms each generate over $1 billion in annual sales.\nPartially offsetting growth in the quarter is the impact of volume-based procurement in China and timing of international tenders primarily in orthopedics and supply challenges primarily in surgical vision. Aligned with our previously communicated expectations, MedTech operational sales grew sequentially versus the prior quarter. And for additional context, selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter.\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 170 basis points, primarily driven by unfavorable currency impact in the Pharmaceutical business and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies in the MedTech and the Consumer Health businesses.\nWe continue to invest strategically in Research and Development at competitive levels, investing 15.1% of sales this quarter. The $3.6 billion invested was a 5% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business and increased investment across multiple franchises in the MedTech business.\nThe Other Income and Expense line was an expense of approximately $500 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by lower litigation expense, partially offset by losses on securities, Consumer Health separation-related costs and COVID-19 vaccine-related costs in the current quarter.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.4% versus 4.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2022 tax costs incurred as part of the planned separation of the company's Consumer Health business due to the reorganization of certain international subsidiaries, a onetime special item in Q3 2021 that reduced taxable income in the quarter and unfavorable income mix. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16% versus 13.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.\nNow let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 34.5% to 33.9%, primarily driven by unfavorable currency and commodity inflation impact on cost of products sold.\nPharmaceutical margins declined from 43.8% to 41.9%, primarily driven by unfavorable currency and cost of products sold.\nMedTech margins remained flat at 25.5%. Commodity inflation and increased investment in Research and Development were offset by supply chain efficiencies and Sales, Marketing and Administrative leveraging. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 24.2% to 24.3% despite inflationary pressures driven by price actions and investment prioritization.\nThis concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. As Jess just shared, we are pleased to report solid results across our business segments in the third quarter. We accelerated operational sales growth across all 3 segments, and we're able to meet earnings expectations despite significant inflationary impacts to input costs. This performance reflects the strength of our business and versatility of our operations despite persistent global macroeconomic challenges.\nGiven Johnson & Johnson's 136-year history, we are no stranger to periods of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, but we have a proven track record of navigating through periods of challenge and volatility. With a diversified portfolio and strong balance sheet, we've repeatedly demonstrated our ability to deliver results in the short term while executing against our long-term strategy, focused on improving health outcomes and access to care.\nLet me share a few enterprise highlights from the quarter.\nWe continue to deploy effective strategies to provide the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients rely on in the face of supply chain pressures. Our teams have been working tirelessly to help mitigate the impact of these challenges by working with our partners to make sure we're meeting demand.\nWe continue to invest for growth, driven by innovation, as demonstrated by the recent opening of our R&D campus in San Francisco, which will expand our R&D presence in the Bay Area. I had the pleasure of being at the opening for this campus. Seeing it in person only reinforces for me that the combination of science, technology and data analytics will be the future of medicine.\nWe also made further progress in the separation of Kenvue, the name of the planned new Consumer Health company. In addition to announcing the name, brand, visual identity and purpose, Larry Merlo was named as the Nonexecutive Chair Designate. Congratulations, Larry.\nThibaut, Ashley and Jennifer will provide updates on notable events for their segments later in the call.\nTurning now to cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date, we generated free cash flow in excess of $13 billion. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $34 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt for a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently.\nInvesting in innovation and R&D is our top priority. And through 3 quarters, we have increased our R&D investment by approximately 8% over the same period last year. In addition to investing in organic growth opportunities, our team continues to evaluate strategic acquisitions and other external collaborations that would enhance our current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets while delivering strong financial returns.\nIn mid-September, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase of up to $5 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock. This program underscores our confidence in the business and our pipeline while also delivering returns for our shareholders. This program, combined with our dividends, has yielded nearly $11 billion being returned to shareholders already in 2022.\nMoving on to full year 2022 guidance. As evidenced by the third quarter operational sales growth across all 3 businesses, health care as well as our business continues to be rooted in strong fundamentals despite various macroeconomic pressures. We continue to see a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. And as seen on this slide, inflation in the U.S. remains at levels not experienced in decades and not unique to the U.S.\nYou saw some of this impact reflected in this quarter's gross margin, eroding in comparison to Q3 2021, attributable to both currency and higher input cost. Despite these pressures, we are reaffirming our operational sales and reported adjusted earnings per share midpoint and tightening the ranges.\nOn sales, we are narrowing our base business operational sales range to $97.5 billion to $98 billion or a growth rate of 7% at the midpoint. While this full year operational sales guidance is an acceleration to our year-to-date growth, it does imply a slight deceleration when comparing to the third quarter growth, driven by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in EMEA during the month of September.\nWe don't speculate on currency impacts. However, using the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 0.97, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 490 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 1.8% to 2.3% compared to 2021 or $93 billion to $93.5 billion.\nRegarding other lines on the P&L. While we were able to absorb some of the inflationary pressures this year, we are lowering our full year Operating Margin projection due to the impacts of inflation across most spend categories to a decline of approximately 50 basis points. Given year-to-date trends on favorable employee benefit-related items, we are increasing our other income estimates to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.\nRegarding interest income and expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience whereby we have a higher cash balance earning at rates higher than previously anticipated, we are increasing the range of our estimate to $175 million to $200 million of income. And finally, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% to 15.5%.\nConsidering these revised estimates, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis of $0.03 at the midpoint. The updated range is $10.70 to $10.75 or a midpoint of $10.73, reflecting a growth rate over 2021 of 9.5%. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.68 per share. As a result and by tightening the range, our reported adjusted earnings per share is $10.02 to $10.07, which maintains the previous midpoint of $10.05.\nI appreciate that many of you are turning some of your attention to 2023. We are actively finalizing our plans for next year, but allow me to provide some preliminary qualitative perspectives to consider as you develop your models. We remain confident that we'll continue to grow our Pharmaceutical business every year towards our goal of $60 billion in Pharmaceutical sales by 2025 despite the STELARA LOE, which is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 in the U.S.\nFor MedTech, we expect our investments in innovation and commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our competitiveness. At this time, we anticipate positive procedure trends with the caveats that COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, lingering headwinds from hospital staffing and some impact from volume-based pricing in China.\nFor Consumer Health, we are seeing the benefits of our strategic price increases and a reduction in supply chain disruptions, although some challenges are expected to continue into 2023. We expect inflationary pressures and higher input costs to persist, and we are continuing to take actions to offset these challenges. While some inflationary pressures are improving, keep in mind that certain products we manufacture in 2022 will be sold and flow through our P&L in 2023.\nAs far as standing up Kenvue as an independent company, we expect to announce further details on the type of separation as well as stand-up cost estimates and how we are addressing stranded costs later this year or early in 2023. We remain on track to complete the separation in mid to late 2023, as indicated in the initial announcement we made in November of 2021.\nFinally, as previously mentioned, we don't speculate on currency movement, but utilizing the euro spot rate of last week, we estimate an unfavorable currency impact on 2023's adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.40 to $0.45 or $0.10 more than the $0.30 to $0.35 impact I referenced in July's call.\n2022 has proven to be an active and unpredictable year, yet Johnson & Johnson continues to reliably meet the needs of patients while navigating the volatile global economic and operating environment. The Executive Committee could not be prouder of our team members across the globe for their commitment to excellence. We are continuously inspired by their dedication and unwavering focus on delivering growth for our stakeholders while staying true to our credo.\nI am now pleased to welcome our worldwide chairs, starting with Thibaut for Consumer Health, soon to be officially Kenvue.\n\nThibaut Mongon\n\nExecutive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Consumer Health, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning to all of you. We are indeed very proud of the achievements we have completed so far in 2022. As we shared with you throughout the year, we told you that Consumer Health would deliver improved performance starting in the second half of the year, and that is exactly what you saw with our good performance in the third quarter.\nOur strategy is working. Our pricing actions were realized, supply chain constraints eased, and we are also against easier prior year comparables. Our third quarter results reflect those dynamics and really demonstrate our ability to achieve results despite the macroeconomic environment that Joe referenced and that continues to be volatile. And all of this thanks to the strength of our brands and the quality of our teams.\nSo looking towards 2023 and in line with our results to date, we do anticipate that the strength and resilience of our well-balanced portfolio, together with the consumer loyalty to our brands, will continue to position our business to perform competitively with the market.\nNow regarding our future, as you just heard from Joe, we are making great strides towards the planned separation of the Consumer Health business, including our recent announcement of our new name, Kenvue. So as you can imagine, a lot of thought and care was taken to ensure that the name was memorable, distinctive, easy to pronounce in multiple languages. We then applied our expert brand-building skills to create a brand identity that reflects our new name, but also leave space for iconic brands that touch the lives of more than 1 billion people around the world every day. Every element was chosen to truly represent us as a future stand-alone company with the core attributes demonstrating an association with trust, care, science and positioning Kenvue as a modern digital-first company.\nWe also unveiled our purpose this quarter, which is Realize the Extraordinary Power of Everyday Care. And in these 7 words, we reflect our heritage of caring, but also play back what the world expects of us and the role we need to fulfill in society. We indeed believe that daily self-care rituals add up over time and have a profound cumulative impact on well-being. And our work at Kenvue will be to put that power into the hands of consumers around the world.\nSo we're excited for the journey ahead now with Larry Merlo named as our Designate Nonexecutive Chair, and our teams are all focused on continuing to deliver results while progressing towards realizing the full potential of Kenvue.\nAnd now let me hand over to Ashley.\n\nAshley A. McEvoy\n\nExecutive VP & Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Thibaut. Well, good morning. So last year was clearly a banner year of our new product innovation, and we are continuing that momentum in 2022 with 4 new products launched, first-in-kind new products launched just in third quarter alone. And clearly, these launches are really contributing to our enhanced competitiveness.\nSo in quarter 3, we launched our next-generation TECNIS Symfony OptiBlue, it's our latest presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens; our ACUVUE OASYS MAX contact lens; the HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter; and the OCTARAY mapping catheter. So to just have a quick refresh on ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX, all of us know, we live digitally intense lives, and this lens was custom designed to really meet those digitally intensive lifestyles. It builds upon our industry-leading portfolio. OASYS is ranked #1. It's the largest brand in the category, and it's unbeaten in comfort across 31 clinical trials.\nMoving over to our Biosense Webster business. We have a launch of our HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter. This catheter is unique. It's a one-shot balloon technology, and it enables PV isolation in 12 seconds with customized energy delivery and our one integrated 3D mapping solution. So we are already seeing the impact. HELIOSTAR has resulted in an 86% freedom from documented atrial arrhythmia at 12 months. So this is our entry into the single-shot ablation.\nReally just a couple of the ways that our team is delivering differentiated solutions really through a focus on breakthrough science and a consistent focus on doctors' critical needs. So I'm very encouraged by the strong innovation to date and even more excited about the potential of our pipeline to come.\nAnd when I start to think about 2023, we are very focused on our mission to make the future of health care smarter, less invasive and more personalized. You've heard me consistently say this is how we can show up in health care. We will continue, particularly in today's times, a little bit of uncertain times, to prioritize programs that are strengthening our core, that are really getting us on the forefront of shaping the new frontiers in medical intervention and a consistent drumbeat of always improving our competitiveness.\nWe know that health care has an unbelievable amount of humility, but also amazing purpose. And as Joe has mentioned, we are -- it's very clearly in a dynamic time. We're going to continue to manage through the macroeconomic factors like hospital staffing, like inflation, like supply constraints and some of the overhang of the pandemic.\nBut we are encouraged with procedural volumes in many parts of the world. They're recovering quite nicely. Some parts of the world are still a little bit below pre-COVID levels, but we are confident in the resiliency and agility of the Medtech industry and our anticipated continued recovery across the world.\nSo thank you, and I'm pleased to turn it over to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer L. Taubert\n\nExecutive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ashley, and hello, everyone. Good morning. I'd really like to start off by thanking my Pharmaceutical colleagues for another strong quarter with operational growth of 9%. That was broadly based across our portfolio and our regions. As Jess noted, we continued to maximize the value of our diverse leading portfolio, delivering above-market growth with a number of key drivers: DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA, also UPTRAVI, XARELTO and our long-acting paliperidone portfolio. So really great performance across the portfolio and throughout the globe.\nIn addition to our strong performance, the Pharmaceutical business achieved some important milestones during the quarter, both in terms of approvals and new data readouts. So first, we're really pleased to announce our first approval globally for TECVAYLI. This is our first-in-class, off-the-shelf bispecific antibody for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and this approval was from the European Commission. And we are on track to receive approval from the U.S. FDA before year-end. TECVAYLI is a really important addition to our multiple myeloma portfolio, particularly for this difficult-to-treat patient population.\nAlso in multiple myeloma, the final analysis from our Phase II GRIFFIN Study of a DARZALEX-based investigational quadruplet regimen was presented, really highlighting the potential benefit of adding DARZALEX to this frontline treatment regimen in multiple myeloma in newly diagnosed transplant-eligible patients.\nSeparately, we received 2 approvals for IMBRUVICA. So European Commission approved an all-oral, fixed-duration treatment combination with venetoclax in frontline CLL. And the U.S. FDA granted approval for pediatric patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease, marking the first pediatric approval for IMBRUVICA and making IMBRUVICA the only BTKi with 12 FDA approvals across 7 indications.\nIf we turn to solid tumors, data from our early-stage trials from our combination of amivantamab plus lazertinib were presented at WCLC. Importantly, these data demonstrated a benefit in frontline treatment of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to data from our Phase III MARIPOSA Study in the future.\nAnd last, in Immunology, we presented new data for TREMFYA from the Phase IIIb GUIDE Study, which demonstrated even higher rates of complete skin clearance in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were started earlier in the course of their disease. So it bodes well for earlier treatment for TREMFYA and continued growth.\nAs I said, I'm really proud of our Pharmaceuticals team and what we accomplished in the third quarter, and I look forward to finishing the year strong. As we look ahead, with our focus on transformational medical innovation, our pipeline of current medicines, our robust pipeline of new medicines and world-class capabilities, we remain really confident in our growth expectations, the ones that we outlined in our Pharmaceutical business review last November, including the fact that we expect to be a $60 billion pharmaceutical company by 2025.\nSo thank you very much. And Jess, I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThanks, Jennifer, Thibaut and Ashley. This concludes the prepared remarks portion of our earnings call. Kevin, could you please provide instructions and open the line for Q&A?",

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nPlease note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, the company's future financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. You're cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.\nIn particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website.\nAdditionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. These slides acknowledge those relationships.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nCEO & Director, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGood morning, everyone. This is Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson. Thanks for joining us today. I am accompanied by Joe Wolk and Jessica Moore, and we have the privilege to share our second quarter financial results and answer questions you have regarding Johnson & Johnson's business.\nDuring my first 6 months as CEO, I have had the opportunity to reconnect in person with colleagues, customers and stakeholders around the world. These conversations have energized me about the future of Johnson & Johnson. They have also made clear the critical role our company plays as a leader in bringing innovative health care solutions to patients and customers, both today and long into the future. And they further validated that the 3 strategic priorities I outlined earlier this year will continue to guide us in 2022 as we deliver on our mission to transform the future of human health.\nLet me remind you of those priorities. First, we will continue to advance our industry-leading success in pharmaceuticals by delivering the innovative pipeline we highlighted at our Pharmaceutical Business Review last November. This includes our goal to grow this sector to $60 billion by 2025, with growth in every year, including years facing the STELARA loss of exclusivity and continuing to deliver above-market compounded annual growth of at least 5%.\nIn the second quarter, we saw evidence of this plan coming to fruition with the launch of CARVYKTI in April. And in May, we received conditional marketing authorization in Europe. In addition, talquetamab was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in June. I have great confidence in the strength of our current portfolio, which remains underappreciated, and in our robust pipeline to meet our long-term goals and to deliver transformational medicines that help improve and save lives.\nOur second priority, continue to strengthen our performance in MedTech. Over the past several years, this acceleration in performance has been driven by the delivery of differentiated solutions as well as improved commercial execution. We expect this improvement to continue, enabled by our innovative pipeline as well as the potential for expansion into higher-growth market segments.\nCurrently, 11 MedTech platforms each deliver over $1 billion in revenue annually. And based on the most recent results, we are gaining or holding share in nearly all of these. With the positive momentum in this business and our improvement in competitiveness, MedTech has delivered 6% adjusted operational growth in the first half of 2022. We believe MedTech will continue to be a significant source of value for our investors and our stakeholders.\nThird, we are separating our Consumer Health business to create 2 market-leading stand-alone companies. This separation can be a significant opportunity for value creation. The 2 new global entities will be well positioned to thrive in their respective markets and drive greater strategic and financial success. We are making excellent progress and remain on track to complete the separation in 2023.\nIn the second quarter, we announced the global leadership team for the new Consumer Health organization led by Thibaut Mongon as CEO designate and Paul Ruh as CFO designate. Having worked with both Thibaut and Paul for many years, I'm confident that we have selected the right leadership team to lead the new Consumer Health company in its next chapter.\nThe new Johnson & Johnson comprising our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses will remain the largest, most diversified healthcare products company in the world with over $80 billion in sales. With enhanced operational focus, the new Johnson & Johnson will be poised to bring integrated, comprehensive, disease-centric technology and innovative solutions to enhance patient care. Our balance sheet will remain strong, allowing us to pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities in higher growth markets across both segments, while maintaining our strong dividend distribution.\nWith these clear priorities in place, we are confident in our ability to execute on both our short-term and long-term objectives. We are very pleased to have delivered solid sales and earnings growth through the first half of 2022, reporting adjusted operational sales and EPS growth of 8% and 8.5%, respectively.\nJoe and Jess will share details reflecting above-market adjusted operational sales growth from Pharmaceuticals and continued resiliency in both MedTech and Consumer Health results that stand out given the current global macroeconomic challenges. We are well positioned across the globe to sustain our leadership position in healthcare. We aspire to accelerate growth while maintaining the diversification in our business and our discipline around capital allocation, which have been foundational to our success for over the past 135 years.\nI look forward to addressing your questions soon. But for now, I will turn the call over to Jessica Moore to discuss those details. Jess?\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joaquin. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. As a reminder, you can find additional material, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.\nWe continue to implement enhancements in order to assist you in evaluating our performance. In addition to today's presentation and associated schedules, we will be posting the transcript of today's call as well as an Excel version of key financial schedules.\nI will now review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 segments. Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary, before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes.\nNow let's move to second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $24 billion for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 3% versus the second quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 8% as currency had a negative impact of 5 points. In the U.S., sales increased 2.3%.\nIn regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 3.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 13.9% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 10.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 8.1% worldwide, 2.4% in the U.S. and 14.2% outside the U.S.\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.80 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.35 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59, representing increases of 4.3% and 4.4%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 10.9%.\nI will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2021 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. As stated last quarter, we plan to keep our comments brief to leave more time for Q&A. Please refer to the slides for additional segment and franchise commentary.\nBeginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion decreased 1.3%, with a decline of 3.6% in the U.S. and growth of 0.6% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 2.3% as currency had a negative impact of 3.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 2.9%.\nResults were primarily driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC outside the U.S. due to a strong cold, cough and flu season and digestive health category recovery. This growth was partially offset by a weaker allergy season and supply constraints in the U.S., although these have improved from prior quarters. Furthermore, the Consumer Health business was negatively impacted by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions, mainly affecting the Skin Health/Beauty franchise.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sale of $13.3 billion increased 6.7% with growth of 4.2% in the U.S. and 9.8% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 12.3% as currency had a negative impact of 5.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 12.4%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.6%. Results in the quarter were impacted by unfavorable prior-period adjustments, offset by favorable discounts.\nPharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including 5 assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, STELARA, ERLEADA and TREMFYA, along with our paliperidone long-acting portfolio, which was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales.\nDARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong operational sales growth with increases of 46.1% and 56.9%, respectively. STELARA growth of 18.6% was driven by strong market growth and meaningful share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This represents 5.4 points and 7.4 points of share gain, respectively, in the U.S. Results in the quarter benefited from favorable discounts, partially offset by unfavorable prior-period adjustments for a net favorable impact of approximately 400 basis points.\nTREMFYA grew 29.7%, driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This represents 2.3 points and 3.2 points of share gain, respectively, in the U.S. Results in the quarter were impacted by an unfavorable prior-period adjustment of approximately 750 basis points in unfavorable patient mix.\nIMBRUVICA operational sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competition, particularly in the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive operational growth outside of the U.S. despite ongoing competitive pressures. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022.\nI'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.9 billion decreased 1.1% with growth of 1.6% in the U.S. and declines of 3.6% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 3.4% as currency had a negative impact of 4.5 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 3.4%. Operational sales also grew sequentially versus the prior quarter despite headwinds related to regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions as well as labor and supply constraints.\nDrivers for growth across the MedTech business include procedure recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share positions in nearly all of our 11 priority platforms, each generating over $1 billion in annual sales. For additional context, all franchises were affected by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions, and selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter.\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 50 basis points, primarily driven by increased supply network-related cost with the COVID-19 vaccine and inflation, partially offset by favorable mix. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15.4% of sales this quarter. The $3.7 billion invested was a 9.1% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in Pharmaceutical and MedTech.\nThe other income and expense line was an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a net income of $488 million in the second quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by litigation, higher unrealized losses on securities and Consumer Health separation costs in the current year, partially offset by favorable employee benefit plan-related items.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.6% versus 5.8% in the same period last year. This was primarily driven by a 2021 one-time tax benefit from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.4% versus 14.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.\nNow let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 33.4% to 34%, primarily driven by favorable product and segment mix, partially offset by inflation and portfolio progression in R&D.\nPharmaceutical margin improved from 39.4% to 42%, primarily driven by favorable product mix and brand marketing expense leverage. MedTech margins declined from 28.6% to 26.5%, driven by inflation, unfavorable product mix and increased investments to support new product launches and research and development. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 28.6% to 25.9% due to commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies and one-time favorable items in 2021.\nThis concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson second quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess. As Joaquin and Jess commented, our results remained solid across our 3 segments in the second quarter and through the first half of 2022, particularly in light of macroeconomic headwinds, such as inflation, select countries experiencing continuing impact from COVID-19 and geopolitical matters. Our sustainable, resilient business continues to deliver on the robust operational guidance that we set forth at the beginning of the year, while advancing breakthrough innovation and fostering patient access to make a positive impact across many areas of health care.\nAs previously discussed, we did build-in a healthy assumption to account for inflation in our January guidance, planning for increased costs in labor, energy and transportation. We noted in April, and are doing so again today, that these pressures will continue to impact margins in the third and fourth quarters and into 2023. As such, we continue to pursue mitigation efforts, including cost-improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners.\nAs for segment performance and key events in the quarter, in MedTech, you may recall that performance in Q2 2021 was the strongest of the year for most of the MedTech peer set, including Johnson & Johnson, making this second quarter our toughest comp. On a sequential operational basis and in line with our expectations, we did see an acceleration in sales, even considering the regional COVID-19-related mobility restrictions this quarter.\nAs Joaquin noted, we are focused on continuing the strong cadence of innovation in this business, which includes launches such as the next-generation ECHELON 3000 Stapler, a digitally enabled device demonstrating improved patient outcomes based on clinical evidence. It also includes the EMBOGUARD Balloon Guide Catheter, designed to optimize the removal of blood clots and reduce procedure time in the treatment of ischemic stroke.\nIn Pharmaceuticals, we continued to advance our pipeline and delivered operational sales growth of 8.6%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter, notably above what we delivered in the first quarter of this year. We continue to outpace the market. During the second quarter, we recorded our first sales in the U.S. of CARVYKTI, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with Legend Biotech and received the European Commission approval in May.\nWe also presented new data across our broad oncology portfolio at the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Hematology Association in June. If you haven't done so already, I encourage you to listen to the fireside chat with Peter Lebowitz, our Global R&D Head of Oncology about this promising new data, which can be found on our website.\nA quick update on our COVID-19 vaccine for which we suspended sales guidance last quarter. Recognizing the global progress on vaccine development and distribution against COVID-19 and the amount of existing global supply, we are modifying our COVID-19 vaccine research programs and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all customer contractual commitments. This will result in incremental costs for the year, which will be reflected as a special item. We are proud of the role our vaccine continues to play in the fight against COVID-19.\nIn our Consumer Health business, similar to MedTech, Q2 of 2021 was last year's strongest quarter with 10% adjusted operational sales growth. We remain focused on our 2022 performance objectives of delivering above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while overcoming industry-wide supply constraints and inflationary pressures that are primarily impacting our Skin Health business.\nWe continue to be excited about the creation of the new Consumer Health company. Great work is being done by our teams to effect this complex transaction. We look forward to sharing the new Consumer Health company's name and branding as well as the headquarters' location in the months ahead. Similarly, we look forward to sharing transaction options and further financial details, adhering to regulatory policies later in 2022.\nFinally, I would like to offer my congratulations to Thibaut, Paul and the rest of the leadership team regarding their recent appointments.\nTurning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of approximately $8 billion in the first half of the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $32.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32.6 billion of debt for a net neutral cash position. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Investing in innovation that delivers meaningful products to address unmet needs continues to be our top priority.\nIn the first half of the year, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first half of 2021. The dividend priority Joaquin referenced translated to us distributing $6 billion to shareholders so far this year. We also continue to vigorously evaluate acquisition opportunities that would enhance the current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns.\nMoving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations. The major takeaway is we are maintaining the midpoints of our guidance for adjusted operational sales growth of 7% at $97.8 billion and adjusted operational earnings per share of $10.70 or 9.2% growth for the full year. Given our confidence in delivering full year guidance, based on what we know today, we are tightening the adjusted earnings per share range from $10.65 to $10.75 on a constant currency basis.\nRegarding the remainder of the P&L, there are a few updates. Due to the prolonged impact of inflationary pressures, we are updating our operating margins to be flat versus 2021. Regarding interest expense, based on our year-to-date experience, we have reduced the expense to a neutral position. Again, given year-to-date trends, we are increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to reflect the favorable impact of employee benefit-related items.\nThat may appear light given the current run rate, but we have some one-time items such as real estate sales and Johnson & Johnson Development Corp. gains, which we don't expect to repeat in the second half of this year. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% to 15.5% based on our year-to-date progression.\nAs we always do, let me give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, specifically the strengthening U.S. dollar. Utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.0, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.5 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.20 impact for the estimated reported adjusted earnings per share versus the projection utilized in April's guidance.\nThe full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $4 billion on reported sales and $0.65 on reported adjusted earnings per share. As this chart illustrates, it's not just that the euro and U.S. dollar have reached parity, something we haven't seen in nearly 2 decades, it's also the rapid pace at which the fluctuations are occurring. A dynamic only experienced a few times over that same period.\nIn addition, while it's much too early to comment on 2023, we do think it is helpful to point out what the currency impact may be if current assumptions for our estimate holds. Of the current $0.65 unfavorable impact I just referenced, about $0.30 to $0.35 will carry over into 2023's EPS. Certainly, there's a long way to go before we finalize next year's outlook, but wanted to give you a sense of how to think about the foreign currency impact.\nBack to the current year. In terms of 2022 quarterly phasing considerations for your models, we continue to estimate that the back half will improve over the first half with a slight bias for higher growth in Q4 over Q3. In Consumer Health, we have seen quarter-over-quarter reduction in supply disruptions that we anticipate will continue. We also expect to see the benefit of recent strategic price increases in the back half of the year. Finally, the fourth quarter of 2021 had lower growth than the third quarter, resulting in an easier comparison.\nFor MedTech, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half, driven by market recovery from continued enhancement of our competitive position through commercial execution and uptake from our recently launched products. We expect the fourth quarter 2022 to be slightly stronger than the third quarter. COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, and we continue to monitor any related impacts.\nFor Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in our base business, with sales modestly accelerating through the end of the year.\nTo close out the prepared remarks, Johnson & Johnson has continued to post solid results as our teams navigate a challenging external environment. Our financial performance reinforces our confidence in our ability to grow and deliver near- and long-term value. That is only possible because of our employees around the world, who we'd like to thank for remaining focused on delivering our innovative health care solutions and results for all of our Credo stakeholders.\nJoaquin, Jess and I will now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those participants on the call wishing to ask a question?",

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nGood morning. This is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Johnson & Johnson. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our company's first quarter 2022 financial results and full year 2022 outlook.\nWhile many things have changed in the world since our last call, much has stayed the same for Johnson & Johnson. We continue to deliver reliable growth and generate meaningful free cash flow, enabling us to invest and advance our pipeline, increase our dividend for the 60th consecutive year and continued to make a positive impact across the landscape of health care. It is, however, important to take a few moments to recognize the current events that are impacting the world we're living in.\nToday, while we're all still managing through the global pandemic, as evidenced by the current surge of cases in China, we also [see] the increasing hardship brought on by the war in Ukraine. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and their families. Guided by our credo and grounded in our purpose, our hearts are with all those affected by these crises and hope for a rapid resolution to both.\nNow I'd like to turn the program over to Jessica Moore, Vice President, Investor Relations, to take you through our Q1 results.\n\nJessica Moore\n\nVP of IR, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joe. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com.\nSeveral of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.\nMoving to today's agenda. I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 segments. Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions.\nDuring the Q&A portion of the call, Joe will be joined by Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, MedTech; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health; and Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceutical. We have heard your feedback and are implementing a few enhancements this quarter.\nFirst, we are now providing select earlier phase clinical trial information on our pharmaceutical pipeline to streamline your data collection efforts from clinicaltrials.gov. Second, rather than sharing detailed business performance commentary on each part of the business, I will summarize the significant business drivers, leaving more time for Q&A. You can find additional detailed segment commentary in our earnings presentation. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now let's move to the first quarter results.\nWorldwide sales were $23.4 billion for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% versus the first quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.7 points.\nIn the U.S., sales increased 2.7%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 7.2%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.6% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 5.4 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.9% worldwide, 2.8% in the U.S. and 12.9% outside the U.S.\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.32 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.67, representing increases of 3% and 3.1%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.2%.\nI will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2021 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.\nBeginning in 2022, certain over-the-counter products previously reported under the Pharmaceutical segment have been reclassed to Consumer Health. These products represent roughly $100 million of sales per quarter. Please refer to the supplemental sales schedules for prior year restatements. Also, as stated in our 2021 10-K, effective January, our Medical Devices segment is now referred to as MedTech.\nBeginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.8% with a decline of 3.4% in the U.S. and growth of 4.1% outside the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, Worldwide growth was 1.6%. Consumer Health was negatively impacted by industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to ingredients and packaging availability as well as labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business, worth approximately 280 basis points worldwide and 500 basis points in the U.S. Adjusting for these constraints, Consumer Health delivered solid results, primarily due to above-market growth in OTC driven by increased TYLENOL, MOTRIN and upper respiratory product sales.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.9 billion increased 9.3% with growth of 2.9% in the U.S. and 16.7% outside of the U.S. Base Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial execution, enabling us to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including 6 assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Base business growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, TREMFYA STELARA, ERLEADA and our paliperidone long-acting portfolio. Growth was partially offset by LOE pressures from both REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with decrease in IMBRUVICA and XARELTO sales. DARZALEX continues to drive very strong operational growth with sales increases of 40.3%, driven by subcutaneous alliance of therapy and in all regions.\nIMBRUVICA sales declined 3.9% worldwide due to increased competition from novel oral agents, particularly in the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive growth outside of the U.S. despite ongoing competitive pressures.\nXARELTO sales declined 13.8% in the U.S. driven largely by a net unfavorable prior period price adjustment and increased cost for patient access, partially offset by continued demand and market growth. The COVID-19 vaccine also contributed approximately $500 million to sales in the quarter. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022.\nI'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7 billion increased 8.5%, with growth of 5.6% in the U.S. and growth of 11.1% outside the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.6%. We see strong performance in Q1 driven by market recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share across most of the 11 priority platforms. We continue to monitor potential impacts on elective procedures driven by COVID-19 resurgences across various markets.\nBefore highlighting the financial performance for the segment, I'd like to share a few notable first quarter MedTech events that demonstrate our stated aspirations of entering higher-growth market segments and continuing to build upon digital technologies across the portfolio.\nTwo acquisitions were closed in the quarter, Crossroads Extremities, with a differentiated portfolio of bunion and hammer toe solutions in the fast-growing elective foot and ankle market; and Cuptomize, which will be a new addition to the VELYS digital surgery platform of connected technologies. The cuptomized solution is designed to give surgeons an easy-to-use tool to better understand and address the impact of abnormal motion between the spine and pelvis in some patients who require total hip arthroplasty and may help reduce the risk of dislocation related to pelvic tilt.\nI am also pleased to share that Fast Company selected Johnson & Johnson MedTech as one 1 its top 10 World's Most Innovative Health Companies of 2022, recognizing MedTech's success and commitment to delivering breakthrough scientific innovation and reimagining health in an increasingly digital world. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 17.4%, with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and OUS regions, driven primarily by success of new products in electrophysiology, commercial execution and continued market recovery.\nWorldwide surgery grew 5%, driven by strong performance in wound closure and biosurgery where we continue to gain market share. MONARCH-enabled procedures now exceed 14,000 since launch, providing continued evidence of the adoption of MONARCH technology in patient treatment regimens.\nThe worldwide Orthopedics franchise grew 5.6%, reflecting COVID-19 recovery, continued penetration in the U.S. ambulatory surgery center channel or ASCs; and penetration of new product launches, such as enhancements to VELYS hip navigation, VELYS robotic-assisted solution and a tune cementless knee system. Partially offsetting this growth was softness in spine procedures in the U.S.\nThe worldwide Vision franchise continued its double-digit growth, growing 13.9% this quarter. Contact lenses global growth of 10.6% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS multifocal and ACUVUE DEFINE Fresh.\nSurgical vision delivered global growth of 23.8%, with both the U.S. and OUS posting growth above 20%, fueled by market recovery and share momentum due to the success of recently launched products, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. As a reminder, additional sales commentary for all of our segments can be found on the slides.\nNow turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, driven by unfavorable mix in the MedTech business and commodity inflation in the Consumer Health business. Sales, marketing and administrative deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by higher brand marketing expenses in Consumer Health and timing of brand marketing expenses in the Pharmaceutical segment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.8% of sales this quarter. The $3.5 billion investment was an 8.9% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in Pharmaceutical and MedTech.\nIn process, research and development reflects an impairment expense of $610 million for certain indications associated with bermekimab, the investigational compound acquired from XBiotech Inc. as disclosed in our previous SEC filings. This impairment was driven by the termination of development of bermekimab for atopic dermatitis based on efficacy data. The other income and expense line was net income of $102 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was the result of lapping prior year gains on the divestiture of Doxil, Calyx and EBRA in 2021, higher unrealized losses on securities and Consumer Health separation costs. This was partially offset by favorable returns associated with our employee benefit plans.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 12.2% versus 16.6% in the same period last year. The decreased tax rate was primarily driven by lower U.S. income due to higher unrealized losses on securities and the impairment of bermekimab IP R&D compared to prior year divestiture gains.\nExcluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 37.1% to 35.1% due to product mix, commodity inflation, increased brand marketing expense, portfolio progression in R&D and comparisons to gains from prior year divestitures. Pharmaceutical margin declined from 45.5% to 44.1%, primarily driven by timing of brand marketing expenses and general portfolio progression in R&D.\nMedTech margins declined from 30.6% to 27%, driven by unfavorable product mix. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 26.8% to 22.1% due to commodity inflation and higher brand marketing expenses.\nThis concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call back over to Joe Wolk.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nAs Jess just mentioned, Johnson & Johnson posted solid performance for the quarter, continuing to invest in the business for the long-term success while overcoming multiple macroeconomic headwinds, including inflationary pressures and higher input costs. These external challenges include limited availability and rising prices of certain commodities; as well as increased costs for labor, energy and transportation. These impacts are pervasive across the enterprise, but most notable in Consumer Health. We expect these pressures will continue to some degree throughout the remainder of 2022. However, mitigation efforts are underway, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners. We are committed to sustaining supply of the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients want and need.\nTurning to our segments and notable events in the quarter. MedTech led our enterprise performance with nearly 9% adjusted operational sales growth. We continue to drive this business forward and are increasing the value of our pipeline through innovation, internally and externally, procedures this quarter with the easing of COVID restrictions in many parts of the world, but we recognize that the situation is fluid, which requires monitoring.\nBuilding on more than 20 major new product launches in 2021, MedTech announced the addition of 2 new innovations to our ATTUNE portfolio, the ATTUNE cementless fixed bearing knee with AFyxium-3DP technology and the ATTUNE medial stabilized knee system.\nIn our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver above-market growth driven by volume as evidenced by our recently published 2021 Janssen U.S. Transparency Report, which reflects our fifth consecutive year of price decreases across the portfolio despite inflationary pressures. We also continue to advance our Pharmaceutical pipeline. This quarter, we received FDA approval for KARVICTI, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with our partner, Legend Biotech. We are partnering with clinics utilizing a phased approach to begin patient dosing, and the feedback to date has been positive.\nWe also filed teclistamab, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody seeking EMA approval, and we also received priority review from the FDA, potentially expanding our multiple myeloma portfolio further.\nIn our Consumer Health business, we remain focused on delivering on our 2022 performance objectives, continuing to achieve above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while navigating industry-wide supply constraints that have primarily impacted our Skin Health/Beauty business.\nWe continue to be excited about the activity related to the announcement we made in November on the creation of 2 new industry-leading companies: the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health company. For the new Johnson & Johnson, the portfolio will remain well diversified with 25 brands delivering over $1 billion in sales annually, holding market-leading positions across key therapeutic areas and franchises.\nThe financial hallmarks of Johnson & Johnson will remain the same, including a well-defined capital allocation strategy, a disciplined approach to inorganic growth and a strong balance sheet while also creating opportunities to sharpen focus on execution and clinically differentiated innovation. The new Consumer Health company will also have a strong financial profile and be better positioned to drive incremental growth, realizing increased potential in new markets through a more agile operating model. The company will continue to deliver science-backed innovation and enhanced digital consumer-centric solutions.\nThe Consumer Health separation team is making substantial progress related to our efforts in establishing the new independent company. As previously mentioned, we cannot disclose new financial information specific to Consumer Health in order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways. Our time lines remain unchanged. We anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health company in the coming months with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year.\nIn the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies.\nFinally, consistent with previous communications, we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment adhering to the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis.\nTurning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow for the quarter of nearly $3.4 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $30 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $3 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Internal innovation remains critical to our future growth and a top priority.\nIn the first quarter, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first quarter of 2021. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps or play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we were pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend for the 60th consecutive year from $1.06 per share to $1.13 per share, an increase of 6.6%.\nMoving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations. I'll start with comments on our COVID-19 vaccine and foreign exchange impacts, essentially the only items with updates from our January guidance. As market demand for all COVID-19 vaccines is currently challenged by global supply surplus and vaccine hesitancy in developing markets, we have made the decision to suspend guidance for sales of our COVID-19 vaccine. This will enable investors to focus on the performance of our core businesses, which drive the current and future value for investors.\nWe are maintaining the total adjusted operational earnings per share guidance we provided in January, absorbing, if need be, the modest income impact from the COVID-19 vaccine.\nRegarding foreign exchange, as you know, we don't offer guidance or predictions on currency movements. But to give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.1 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.25 for reported adjusted earnings per share versus the calculation related to January's guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $2.5 billion on reported sales and $0.45 on reported adjusted earnings per share. All other line items for which we provide guidance remain the same as communicated in January. To reiterate, we are maintaining our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance.\nWe don't provide quarterly guidance, but do understand that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations as you update your models. In Consumer Health, we expect supply constraints to continue throughout the year but not to the same extent in the second half. As a result, we anticipate that the back half performance will improve over the first half.\nFor MedTech, while the first quarter demonstrated faster recovery than we anticipated, our full year expectations remain fairly intact. We anticipate continued market recovery and uptake from recently launched products and are monitoring the ever-changing COVID dynamics, particularly the surging cases in China.\nSimilar to Consumer Health, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. As a reminder, with respect to growth rates, the second quarter was the strongest quarter for MedTech in 2021.\nThe expectations for the Pharmaceutical base business remain the same. We anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth with relatively consistent growth throughout the remainder of the year.\nIn summary, Johnson & Johnson had a solid start to the year despite managing macroeconomic headwinds, and we remain confident in our business. I would like to recognize the continued efforts of our 144,000 global colleagues focused on delivering our innovative health care solutions to our credo stakeholders. Their unwavering dedication and support continue to inspire. And on behalf of the executive team, I'd like to extend our gratitude.\nI am now pleased to welcome to the call, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon and Jennifer Calvert, our Worldwide Chairs to address your questions. Kevin, can you please provide instructions and open the line for Q&A?",

This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 and our financial outlook for 2022. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details.\nThis review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.

Joaquin will close the call by sharing his perspective on the health care environment and his strategic priorities as the new CEO of Johnson & Johnson. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes.\nNow to recap the fourth quarter. Worldwide sales were $24.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 11.6% as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales growth was 18.5%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 21.2%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 12.3% worldwide, 3.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S.\nI would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included additional shipping days, which negatively impacted 2021 fourth quarter growth by approximately 400 basis points and full year growth by about 100 basis points. These impacts can be roughly applied across all segments, but were more heavily skewed to the U.S.\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.77 versus diluted earnings per share of $0.65 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.13, representing increases of 14.4% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.2%.\nFor the full year 2021, consolidated sales were $93.8 billion an increase of 13.6% compared to the full year of 2020. Operationally, full year sales grew 12.2%, with currency having a positive impact of 1.4 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 9.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales growth was 18.2%. Operational sales outside the U.S. grew by 15.3%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 12.8% worldwide, 9.5% in the U.S. and 16.6% outside the U.S.\nNet earnings for the full year 2021 were $20.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $7.81 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.51 a year ago. 2021 adjusted net earnings were $26.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.80, representing increases of 22.2% and 22%, respectively, versus full year 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 20.2%.\nBeginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2021 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models.\nWorldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and grew 1.8%, with growth in the U.S. of 1.3% and 2.1% outside the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9%. Consumer health was negatively impacted by the 2020 additional shipping days worth approximately 400 basis points, which can be roughly applied to all franchises as well as industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to raw material availability and labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business worth approximately 360 basis points. Adjusting for these items, solid results were primarily driven by above-market growth in OTC. E-commerce continues to have strong double-digit growth.\nFinally, when comparing to 2019, Consumer Health grew approximately 4% in the quarter. When adjusting for acquisition and divestitures, sales growth was closer to 5%.\nOver-the-counter medicines globally grew 15.8% due to increased incidents in U.S. adult and pediatric fever and worldwide category recovery in cough, cold and flu and digestive health. The U.S. also saw share gains primarily in TYLENOL and MOTRIN. Strength was seen across multiple areas in the portfolio, including analgesics, upper respiratory, digestive health, naturals and anti-smoking aids.\nThe Skin Health and Beauty franchise declined 7.1%, driven by external supply constraints, primarily in NEUTROGENA and OGX and divestitures worth approximately 230 basis points, primarily due to Sedona, the [small] land-based portion of Dr.Ci:Labo and Asia Pacific. Declines were partially offset by market recovery and e-commerce strength.\nOral Care declined globally 6.5% as compared to strong double-digit growth in the prior year, driven by the [Floss] divestiture worth approximately 170 basis points and category declines in EMEA. Declines were partially offset by successful brand building and promotional campaigns in Asia Pacific.\nThe Baby Care franchise declined 0.8% with U.S. declines of 7.5% and growth of 1.3% outside the U.S. Declines were driven by prior year retailer stocking and external supply constraints in the U.S., partially offset by e-commerce growth of AVEENO Baby and Asia Pacific.\nWound Care declined 6.4%, primarily due to the divestiture of the professional tape business worth approximately 150 basis points, partially offset by strong performance of Band-Aid brand and adhesive bandages in the U.S. Women's Health grew 1.3%, driven by market recovery in Latin America.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $14.3 billion grew 17.9%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 4.2% and OUS sales increasing by 36.9%. Worldwide sales included a $1.6 billion contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide growth was 18.6%.\nOur strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver the tenth consecutive full year of worldwide above-market adjusted operational growth. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 7.1% driven by strong performance of TREMFYA and STELARA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. TREMFYA was up 82.8% worldwide, with continued share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased nearly 3 points in both the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications.\nSTELARA grew 5.1% worldwide driven by strong share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with increases of roughly 4 points and roughly 6 points, respectively, in the U.S. Current quarter growth was impacted by a negative prior period rebate adjustment and reserve adjustment recorded in Q4 2021 in the U.S. worth approximately 700 basis points on worldwide growth for the quarter versus the prior year.\nOur oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 12.3%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 33.4% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU and [continuing] launches globally. DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 8 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter.\nERLEADA grew 61.3% worldwide, driven by strong share uptake, increased market penetration in the U.S. and new launches outside of the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintained its market leadership position, however, declined 3.1% worldwide due to competitive pressures from novel oral agents. U.S. decline was partially offset by growth in all regions outside of the U.S.\nNeuroscience grew 7.1% worldwide driven by the paliperidone long-acting portfolio posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts, strong persistency globally and the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA in the quarter. The cardiovascular metabolism and other business declined 13.8% worldwide due to competitive pressures in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT.\nOur pulmonary hypertension portfolio was roughly flat, driven by COVID-19 market constraints and generic entrants and other pulmonary hypertension, offset by U.S. share uptake in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI.\nI'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.9 billion, growing 5.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales grew 5.6% worldwide. The medical devices market continued to be impacted by COVID-19, with the Omicron variant contributing to a softening of recovery trends in medical and surgical procedures, especially late in the quarter. Consistent with prior COVID-19 surges, impacts were more acute in areas deemed to be more deferrable in nature, including spine and knees.\nComparing to 2019, Medical Devices grew about 4% on an adjusted operational basis. On a full year basis, Medical Devices growth versus 2019 was just over 4.5%, building on the pre-COVID growth momentum.\nInterventional Solutions continued to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit worldwide growth at 15.3% driven by market recovery, successful penetration of new products and commercial execution across both electrophysiology and CERENOVUS.\nAdvanced Surgery grew 7.6% worldwide, driven by market recovery; expansion into Tier 2 and 3 hospitals in China; and performance of newer products such as ENSEAL X1 and Energy, ECHELON Plus and endocutters and surgery cell powder and biosurgery.\nMONARCH system orders in the fourth quarter marked the highest number of orders in any quarter since launch. And more importantly, as a positive indicator of MONARCH technology adoption and patient treatment regimens, we continue to see strong growth in the number of MONARCH-enabled bronchoscopy procedures with total procedures since launch exceeding 12,000. In fact, 2021 MONARCH procedures more than doubled those performed in the prior year.\nGeneral Surgery grew 1.7% worldwide, led by wound closure, primarily due to market recovery, coupled with innovation penetration. Inventory dynamics in the prior year negatively impacted wound closure U.S. results by about 350 basis points and positively impacted results outside the U.S. by about 250 basis points.\nWorldwide orthopedics declined 0.7% versus prior year, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on procedures. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 2.0%, driven by continued market stabilization and the success of recently launched products, partially offset by competitive pressures in China. The positive impact on growth from prior year inventory contractions in China was primarily offset by the additional shipping days in 2020.\nWorldwide hips grew 2.7%, driven by continued strength from our portfolio, including the Active STEM and technologies such as VELYS Hip Navigation, sustaining our leadership in the anterior approach. Growth in the outpatient surgery channel in the U.S. and market recovery outside the U.S. were additional contributors to growth.\nWorldwide knees was relatively flat with a decline of 4.2% in the U.S. and growth of 6.5% outside the U.S. The U.S. market was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and health care resource constraints on procedures. These impacts were partially offset by strong growth in the outpatient channel and positive momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE portfolio. Growth outside the U.S. was driven by market recovery and success of products such as ATTUNE Revision.\nLastly, in Orthopedics, worldwide spine declined 9.4%, primarily driven by a deceleration in procedure volumes related to COVID-19 and health system resource constraints. Partially offsetting this decline are the positive impacts from the continued success of new products such as X-Pac, CONDUIT and SYMPHONY and prior year inventory reductions in China contributing approximately 360 basis points to worldwide growth.\nWorldwide Vision grew 11%. Contact lens and other grew 7.1% worldwide. U.S. growth of 9.4% was driven by successful commercial campaigns and adoption of recently launched ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL for presbyopia. U.S. growth was impacted by inventory fluctuations in both the current and prior year worth about 550 basis points. Growth outside the U.S. of 5.8% was driven by market recovery, coupled with strength of new product launches such as ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH.\nSurgical vision grew 22.1% globally, with both the U.S. and OUS businesses growing double digits. These positive results were driven by market recovery and share gains from recent differentiated product launches across all surgical vision product lines, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy in our ocular lenses used in cataract surgery.\nNow regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021, I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. As reported earlier, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 reflects a reported increase of 14.5% and an operational increase of 17.2%. Cost of products sold leveraged by 270 basis points, primarily driven by favorable mix within the pharmaceutical business; a reduction in prior year COVID-19 related costs in the Medical Devices business; and favorable mix within the enterprise, with a larger portion of sales from the pharmaceutical business.\nSelling, marketing and administrative margins remained relatively flat, driven by increased brand marketing expense in the Consumer Health business, mostly offset by expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 19% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 by 110 basis points driven by portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business and higher investment in the Medical Devices business.\nThe other income and expense line is a net expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of $2.4 billion last year. This was driven by lower litigation expenses.\nRegarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased to 2.1% compared to a benefit of 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the prior year tax benefit associated with litigation expenses, partially offset by onetime tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.4% versus 11.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2021 10-K for additional details on specific tax matters.\nLastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 24.9% to 25.6%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 recovery. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment: Medical Devices improved by 160 basis points, driven by recovery of prior year COVID-19 production-related slowdowns and related inventory impacts; Consumer Health margins declined by 460 basis points, primarily driven by increased brand marketing expenses and inflationary pressure, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. The improvement in Pharmaceutical margins of 110 basis points was primarily driven by favorable product mix and selling, marketing and administration leverage.\nThis slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. As reported today, our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $9.80 reflects a reported increase of 22% and an operational increase of 20.2%. The growth is primarily related to COVID-19 recovery realized predominantly in our Medical Devices business.\nLastly, I direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.\nMoving to the next slide. Our full year 2021 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved by 170 basis points versus 2020. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices improved by 870 basis points to 25.7%, primarily driven by recovery of prior year COVID-19 production-related slowdowns and related inventory impact. Pharmaceutical margins declined by 150 basis points to 40.5%, primarily driven by R&D portfolio progression. Consumer Health margins were flat at 23.8%, driven by increased brand marketing expense and inflationary pressure, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies.\nWe continue to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investment in R&D that have increased $2.6 billion or 21% on a full year basis.\nIn the quarter, we received approval by the European Commission for the long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy, BYANNLI, for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. This approval makes BYANNLI the first twice-yearly treatment for adults living with schizophrenia, providing the longest available dosing interval for an antipsychotic medication to be approved in Europe.\nAdditionally, RYBREVANT received conditional marketing authorization in EMEA. RYBREVANT, a bispecific therapy targeting both EGFR and CMAT, is the first treatment approved for patients with non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy.\nFinally, we submitted a biologics license application to the U.S. FDA seeking approval of teclistamab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and as aligned with our strategy to expand treatment options for multiple myeloma patients. Teclistamab is an investigational off-the-shelf T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody targeting both BCMA and CD3.\nConsistent with our disciplined approach to portfolio prioritization, we are discontinuing the SELECT Phase III study assessing the efficacy and safety of [selexipag] as an add-on to the standard of care therapy in patients with inoperable CTEP, as the study did not meet its primary end point.\nMedical Devices announced a strategic collaboration with Microsoft to further develop a secure and compliant digital ecosystem with a goal of connecting devices across the entire portfolio. This collaboration will help enhance the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in order to generate insights leading to smarter, less invasive and more personalized solutions across the entire patient care continuum.\nThis concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2021. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.\n\nJoseph J. Wolk\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Jess, and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and our outlook for 2022. We continue to manage the implications of COVID-19 globally, but it is encouraging to see the resilience of our business, driven by the dedication of countless health care professionals and the 136,000 Johnson & Johnson colleagues around the world. Their collective commitment and focus on providing health care solutions enabled us to deliver another year of strong financial performance.\nOur Pharmaceuticals segment delivered a tenth consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth. Medical Devices continued to manage through the ongoing impact of COVID-19 to experience a partial recovery, and consumer health grew competitively while navigating industry-wide supply constraints. All of this culminated in Johnson & Johnson posting adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 22% for the year, while also investing in our business for the future. We are well positioned as we head into 2022.\nBefore we recap our year-end cash position and guidance for 2022, I'd like to touch on the announcement we made in the fourth quarter regarding our intent to separate our Consumer Health business to create 2 market-leading companies. As independent companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health company will each be better positioned to exercise more focused strategic and capital decisions. We intend for each company to possess compelling financial profiles that reflect the strengths and opportunities of each business, enabling each company to be in a position to enhance the strong results that you've come to expect.\nAs far as where we stand in the process, we have established a very strong, largely separate team focused on advancing the separation. And the financial and operational work streams are well underway. As conveyed in November, the Board of Directors' intent is for the planned separation to occur through the capital markets, and there are multiple capital market separation pathways being considered. Depending on the pathway, there are different SEC requirements that must be adhered to. In order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways, we cannot, at this time, disclose specific Consumer Health financial information not previously disclosed or that which is associated with the separation. As such, you can expect that Consumer Health as well as the rest of our business will be reported as it has been reported previously for the entirety of 2022. We can, however, provide a high-level time line for some nonfinancial items, which may be of interest.\nIn the first half of 2022, we anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health company, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies. Finally, consistent with our previous communications we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment, working within the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis.\nLet's now discuss our 2021 year-end cash position and future capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of nearly $20 billion. At the end of 2021, we had approximately $32 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt for a net debt position of $2 billion. We are pleased that 2021 was another record year in terms of R&D investment at $14.7 billion, a 21% increase over our previous all-time high recorded in 2020.\nWe recognize that investment in innovation is critical to our future growth profile and remains a top priority from a capital allocation standpoint. Given that we are at our lowest levels of net debt in almost 5 years, progressing towards a net cash position, we anticipate leaning in on some of our other capital allocation priorities beyond internal R&D. This includes building upon the 59 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. It also includes, as Joaquin has mentioned in recent forums, utilizing our cash to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps and play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns.\nWe will assess opportunities of all sizes. However, our preferred option is tuck-in deals, which typically offer greater value creation. It is also important to note that should we find the right opportunities, the Consumer Health separation work stream will not prevent us from forging ahead. And finally, with respect to capital allocation, modest share repurchases may be evaluated as part of our capital deployment actions.\nLet me provide a few comments regarding our guidance for full year 2022, which encompasses expectations for our 3 business segments. In our Pharmaceuticals business, we will continue to drive innovation and market-leading sales growth with continued expansion of existing brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and the recently launched RYBREVANT for lung cancer. We are particularly excited about the anticipated FDA approval for CARVICTI, our BCMA CAR-T therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We believe this medicine is best-in-class, showing unprecedented results in clinical trials.\nIn our Medical Devices business, we expect COVID-19 and hospital staffing to continue to be a dynamic variable, likely more impactful in the first half of 2022 as we cycle through Omicron. Our 2022 guidance assumes continued medical devices market recovery, but it also assumes, as you have heard us say previously, enhanced competitiveness. Almost all of our priority platforms are holding or gaining share based on third quarter 2021 year-to-date information, illustrating the positive business momentum versus 2019 when only about 50% of our platforms were holding or gaining share. This improved market performance enables us to maximize the value of recently launched products.\nIn Consumer Health, we are confident that our well-balanced portfolio positions us well. Consistent with current global macroeconomic trends, we are experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures, including higher input costs across our business and more significantly with respect to consumer health. These external challenges include availability and cost of certain commodities, labor and transportation. Similar to competitors, we are instituting price increases across our Consumer Health portfolio in 2022, enabling us to remain competitive as we continue to deliver the products that consumers love and trust.\nSo with that backdrop, let's get into the details for the full year 2022 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. Starting with sales, we expect operational sales growth for the full year 2022 between 7.0% and 8.5%. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures to be negligible, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting the same range as adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.0% to 8.5% or $100.3 billion to $101.8 billion.\nOur 2022 sales guidance includes approximately $3 billion from our COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of this volume is outside of the U.S. for low and middle-income countries corresponding to previously signed advanced purchase agreements. As you know, we do not predict currency movement. But for context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.14, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 5.5% and 7.0% or 6.2% at the midpoint compared to 2021, representing a range of $98.9 billion to $100.4 billion for 2022. As done in the past, I will provide a few qualitative comments related to quarterly phasing.\nStarting with consumer health, the supply constraints that were mentioned as part of Jess' commentary for the quarter will continue into 2022. We estimate that the majority of that impact will be experienced in the first half of the year, primarily in the first quarter and primarily in Skin Health, Beauty. We, therefore, expect second half performance to outperform the first half.\nIn Medical Devices, we expect some COVID-19 headwinds and hospital staffing shortages to continue into 2022, but anticipate market recovery as global health systems treat new patients and work through procedure backlogs. Given this, we expect market recovery to improve as the year progresses and greater contribution from the new products launched in 2021 for an overall better second half.\nFinally, in Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate our market-leading performance will be fairly stable throughout the year, with perhaps some modest adjustments for timing of events associated with alliance revenue or tenders. We are monitoring report surface by large insurers that recent office visits are slightly down in both primary care and specialists.\nI'll continue to go through the items on our P&L, starting with operating margin. We expect 2022 adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points, driven by operating expense leverage, partially offset by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold.\nRegarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs, as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and write-offs. We expect this to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2022, consistent with 2021 levels. Finally, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $0 million and $100 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2022 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current assumptions for geographic mix and certain international tax legislation changes for research and development expenses in 2022. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.60 to $10.80 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 8.2% to 10.2% or 9.2% at the midpoint.\nWhile not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.40 to $10.60 or $10.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 7.1% versus the prior year. We expect the company's COVID-19 vaccine to contribute approximately an incremental $0.20 to earnings per share in 2022.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. I'm now thrilled to welcome Joaquin Duato to his first earnings call as the CEO of Johnson & Johnson. Joaquin, as a colleague who has worked alongside you for the past several years, it's clear that health care and providing good health for everyone, everywhere is not just your business, but a passion. I am excited to welcome you in your new capacity and look forward to continuing to partner with you, the Executive Committee and our colleagues across the globe in our mission to change the trajectory of health for humanity. Over to you, Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato\n\nCEO & Director, Johnson & Johnson\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you all for my first earnings announcement as CEO of Johnson & Johnson. We appreciate everyone tuning in today, and thank you for your interest in our company.\nDespite continued and evolving impact from COVID-19 globally, Johnson & Johnson delivered another strong year of sales and earnings growth. Full year Johnson & Johnson adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% reflects the tenth consecutive year of adjusted operational above-market growth from Pharmaceuticals, the ongoing positive growth momentum from Medical Devices and continued competitive growth in Consumer Health. These strong results contribute to my confidence in our ability to achieve 2022 operational sales and earnings per share growth in the high single digits, with EPS growth that is higher than sales despite macroeconomic factors such as inflation. This, coupled with our differentiated portfolio of pipeline innovation, further strengthens my confidence in our long-term growth potential.\nIn recent months, I have been busy meeting and listening to our customers, partners and members of the Johnson & Johnson family around the world. As part of these conversations, I have thought about the underlying constant of our business, the secret ingredient to our success. It is our people, their dedication and their eagerness to ask the toughest questions and seek the boldest and bravest answers. I'm deeply optimistic about our future, and I feel energized about the potential for our business.\nIn the last 2 years, COVID-19 has changed global perceptions and attitudes towards health care. It has shown us that there is significant opportunity for change and improvement in order to better serve patients, customers and communities around the world. The global response to the pandemic has also created a renewed sense of optimism about the power of science. Around the world, people are focused on personal and societal health in new and urgent ways. And importantly, people are demanding that companies deliver on their promises and act with purpose. Johnson & Johnson will continue to answer that call. We strongly believe the future ahead of us looks brighter and healthier for every patient and consumer. We are determined to achieve this future, grounded by the same mission and credo that always guided us.\nIn 2022, we will run our business as we always have, with these segments, maximizing opportunities for each individually. And I would like to share a bit about our near-term priorities as we focus on successfully creating a new independent Consumer Health company as well as continuing to build on our individual global leadership in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices while enhancing synergies, which uniquely position us to accelerate growth and bring differentiated therapies that span both segments.\nAt the end of last year, I laid out my top 3 priorities for a new era for Johnson & Johnson, and those priorities remain unchanged. These priorities are equally important for our success and include driving Medical Devices to become a best-in-class performer. We continue to focus on improved execution as evidenced by market share momentum as well as our improved cadence of innovation and organic and inorganic expansion into higher growth markets and market segments.\nWe have 11 platforms in Medical Devices, which are over $1 billion. And as we have shared previously, we are gaining or holding share in almost all of this. This includes building upon our global market-leading positions in areas like electrophysiology, biosurgery and contact lenses and gaining market share in areas where we have been more challenged like surgical vision. The team has also launched over 20 new products during 2021, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in orthopedics and 2 new interocular lenses in Surgical Vision.\nNext, delivering on our Pharmaceutical business commitments and long-term growth goals. We are continuing to build upon our promising pharmaceutical pipeline, which we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth rates and are focused on our previously announced long-term goal of growing to a $60 billion segment by 2025. We are continuing to maximize the value of our existing medicines with 13 marketed medicines across 6 therapeutic areas, each to exceed $1 billion in revenue by 2025. We expect to file 36 significant line expansions for these 13 products through 2025.\nHere, it is important to note that these expansions are largely derisked because the products are in the market today, so there is good insight into their overall profiles. In addition, we expect 14 novel therapy filings through 2025, each with the potential to exceed $1 billion in revenue and 5 of this with the ability to exceed $5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the potential patent expiries as we have done in the past and continue to grow at above market rates and finally, ensuring the successful creation of the new Consumer Health company.\nIn the coming year, we will take the steps necessary to be in a position to separate our Consumer Health business from our Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device businesses during 2023. This will advance more targeted business strategies, accelerate growth and deliver improved outcomes for both patients and consumers, which ultimately will deliver greater value to shareholders.\nOur Consumer Health business is competitive in terms of growth and over the past few years has made significant progress improving the margin profile. And as we advance towards a successful new stand-alone Consumer Health company, we will continue to drive this business with the same focus we always have.\nOur best-in-class team is delivering science-backed innovation across OTC, Skin Health and our Specialty business with a focus on digital, consumer-centric solutions and seamless end-to-end customer experience. As Joe noted, we continue to believe that a fit-for-purpose corporate structure and a dedicated capital allocation strategy will provide the Consumer Health business with the agility and flexibility to continue to grow its iconic portfolio of brands and innovate new products in the fast-paced consumer market. And we expect this new and independent company, with nearly $15 billion in 2021 sales, will continue to be a global leader in the Consumer Health industry. And the new Johnson & Johnson at nearly $80 billion in sales in 2021 will continue to be the largest, most diversified health care company in the world and will retain the benefits of scale. We'll enhance our ability to be more focused with our operations, making the new Johnson & Johnson poised to bring integrated and comprehensive care to patients through the use of new technology and innovative science.\nAs we continue to focus on our 3 sectors today, we have no intention of sitting on the sidelines. Our strong financial position, along with the clear priorities we have for our business, position us well to deliver near-term financial expectations and invest for the long-term value creation. We'll have the flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and maintain our track record of growing our dividend while aspiring to be bolder with strategic value-creating acquisitions that will enhance the new Johnson & Johnson in higher growth markets.\nAt this critical time for health care and our global society, we understand the significant role we play, and we accept the responsibility and challenges of the future. I hope you will all join us as we step forward into this new era.\nThank you. And with that, let me turn it back to Jess to open the Q&A.",

I will now turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with our fourth fiscal quarter results. We are pleased with our strong non-GAAP performance with revenues of $11.3 billion and EPS of $3, both of which were above the high end of our guidance. QTL revenues of $1.4 billion and EBT margin of 72% were above the midpoint of our guidance driven by slightly higher handset units. QCT delivered revenues of $9.8 billion and EBT of $2.9 billion, with year-over-year growth of 13% and 17%, respectively. QCT EBT margin of 29% was at the high end of our guidance. QCT handset revenues of $7 billion increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. reflecting increased demand for premium Android handsets powered by our Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 platform. QCT IoT revenues of $1.8 billion grew 7% year-over-year, driven by strength across industrial and networking products and increased demand for AI smart classes powered by our Snapdragon platform. In QCT Automotive, we surpassed $1 billion quarterly revenue milestone, delivering 17% year-over-year revenue growth as the adoption of our Snapdragon digital chassis platform continues to accelerate. With the recent enactment of the One Big Beautiful tax bill, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain in the 13% to 14% range going forward, and we anticipate lower cash tax payments relative to prior expectations.\nThis new legislation resulted in a noncash charge of $5.7 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter to reduce the value of our deferred tax assets. This charge is excluded from non-GAAP metrics, but impacts our GAAP results. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to take a moment to highlight our strong performance in fiscal '25. We are incredibly pleased with our execution with non-GAAP revenues of $44 billion and EPS of $12.03 representing year-over-year growth of 13% and 18%, respectively. In QCT, we achieved 16% year-over-year revenue growth driven by double-digit increases across all revenue streams with IoT up 22% and automotive growing 36%. We also delivered QCT operating margins of 30%, in line with our long-term target we have previously outlined. Over the past 5 years, our non-Apple QCT revenues grew at a 15% compounded annual growth rate. Similarly, over the last 2 years, our non-Apple QCT revenues grew by 17% and 18%, respectively.\nLastly, we generated record free cash flow of $12.8 billion. And consistent with our commitment, we returned nearly 100% to stockholders through repurchases and dividends through the year. Now turning to guidance. In the first fiscal quarter, we expect to deliver record results with revenues in the range of $11.8 billion to $12.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.30 to $3.50. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 74% to 78%. In QCT, we expect record revenues of $10.3 billion to $10.9 billion and EBT margins of 30% to 32%. We anticipate record QCT handset revenues with low teens percentage growth sequentially, primarily driven by new flagship Android handset launches powered by Snapdragon. Following our outperformance for QCT IoT revenues in the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential decline consistent with last year, driven by seasonality in consumer products. In QCT Automotive, following a record fourth quarter, we estimate revenues in the first fiscal quarter to remain flat to slightly up on a sequential basis.\nLastly, we forecast non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.45 billion in the quarter. In closing, as we approach 1 year since outlining our growth strategy at Investor Day, I'd like to provide an update on the progress towards our $22 billion fiscal 2019 revenue target across automotive and IoT. In automotive, we've established ourselves as the most strategic silicon partner for OEMs globally. The accelerating adoption of our StapDragon digital chassis platform and 36% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal '25, puts us on track to achieve our $8 billion revenue target. Across IoT, the increasing importance of artificial intelligence, high-performance, low-power computing and connectivity and validated by our 22% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal '25 reinforces our confidence in achieving our $14 billion revenue target. In Industrial, increasing customer engagement and growth in design win pipeline, combined with our recent acquisitions to unlock access to 30 million users, underlines our confidence in strong revenue growth through the end of the decade.\nIn XR, we are exceeding prior expectations on strong demand for AI smart glasses, and we remain the platform of choice for smart glasses and mixed reality devices across leading global OEMs and ecosystems. In PCs, we extended our technology leadership with the recent launch of Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite extreme platforms, which deliver multigenerational performance increases across CPU, GPU and AI.

Thanks for joining us today. In Fiscal Q3, we delivered revenues of $10.4 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.77, which was near the high end of our guidance range. Our chipset business delivered revenues of $9 billion, reflecting strength in automotive and IoT and ongoing growth in handsets. Automotive and IoT revenues increased 21% and 24% year-over-year, respectively. Our licensing business revenues were $1.3 billion. Our momentum in automotive and IoT is the result of strong execution of our growth and diversification strategy. We remain on track to meet our fiscal 2029 target for combined automotive and IoT revenues of $22 billion. We're forecasting Fiscal 2025 to be the second consecutive year of greater than 15% year-over-year growth in total QCT non-Apple revenues. I will now share some key highlights from the business.\nIn handsets, we extended our Xiaomi collaboration with a multi-year agreement. Snapdragon 8-series platforms will power multiple generations of Xiaomi's flagship devices for China and global markets, with volume increasing each year of the agreement. The Snapdragon 8 Elite continues to set the pace of innovation in mobile processors and is leading the transition to AI smartphones with 124 designs shipped or announced to date. AI usage in smartphones is increasing. For example, Samsung noted that 70% of Galaxy S25 users are utilizing Galaxy AI, and usage of Google Gemini AI has nearly tripled among S25 users compared to the S24. Looking ahead, we expect the range of on-device and agentic AI use cases will continue to expand and reshape the mobile industry. We're optimistic about the Android ecosystem's leadership in AI.\nAs we reach the one-year mark of our entry into AI PCs, we are encouraged by the steady progress we're seeing with our Snapdragon X series platforms. Multiple new devices launched during the quarter from leading OEMs such as Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Samsung, and we remain on track for more than 100 designs to be commercialized through 2026. Snapdragon is transforming personal computing experiences, and the design traction we're seeing from major customers reflects confidence in our technology roadmap, product portfolio, and long-term commitment to PCs. In Q2 2025, according to third-party sources, Snapdragon-based PCs continue to make up approximately 9% of Windows laptops sold above the $600 price tier in retail US and the top five European countries.\nWhile we are at the beginning of our journey into PCs, we remain excited about the long-term opportunity and continue to work toward our target of achieving $4 billion in revenue by Fiscal 2029. In XR, Snapdragon continues to be the platform of choice for smart glasses and mixed reality devices. We now have 19 designs from our global partners. Demand for Meta's AI smart glasses continues to exceed expectations, and they recently expanded their portfolio with the launch of the new Meta Oakley smart glasses and introduction of new Ray-Ban styles. Xiaomi's new AI glasses launched in the quarter were also well received. All three are powered by the Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 platform. At the Augmented World Expo USA, we conducted the world's first demonstration of a 1 billion parameter model running locally on smart glasses powered by our next-generation Snapdragon AI platform.\nWe also introduced a smart ring controller reference design as a new input device for discreet and intuitive interactions. Our Snapdragon Digital Chassis solutions continue to see strong traction across the automotive ecosystem, with 12 new designs during the quarter and a total of 50 vehicle launches this fiscal year. We're incredibly excited about BMW's upcoming Neue Klasse vehicles, which will launch globally with our new ISO safety-certified ADAS stack later this year. This will include our Snapdragon Ride platforms and our jointly developed driving stack, which meets safety standards in the US and Europe. More details about the deployment, certifications, and capabilities will be shared at the IAA Mobility Show in September. Our Snapdragon Ride platforms and driving stack are also gaining momentum more broadly, with 20 OEMs' programs for various highway and Urban Navigate on Autopilot solutions.\nThe majority of these programs will launch in the next 18 months across all global regions. In industrial IoT, we continue to expand our ecosystem of partners, and we're pleased with the traction of our Dragon Wing platforms. At Computex, we announced new collaborations with DigiWin and Aetina to utilize our AI On-Prem Appliance Solution and AI Inference Suites for enterprise automation. We also expanded our work with IBM on their Maximo AI assistant powered by watsonx AI. Our broad range of OEMs and partners now includes companies such as ASUS IoT, Dell, EverFocus, IBASE, Lenovo, Deloitte, e&, HUMAIN, Palantir, and many others.\nWe're also gaining traction with our industrial-grade Dragon Wing IQ series, with up to 100 TOPS of AI inference performance, as well as the Dragon Wing Intelligent Video Suite, a platform designed to extract intelligence from any video frame and create intelligent reasoning workflows for enterprises across many verticals. We've also seen continued strength in edge networking, driven by strong demand for Wi-Fi 7 gateway platforms across retail and carrier customers, and for 5G-enabled fixed wireless access platforms for our carrier customers. Now, I would like to provide an update on our expansion into the data center. This represents a new growth opportunity for Qualcomm and it's a logical extension of our diversification strategy as we continue to demonstrate leadership in CPU performance and NPU efficiency.\nAs inference gains scale, cloud service providers are building dedicated inferencing clusters focused not only on performance but also efficiency, specifically tokens per dollar and tokens per watt. These factors, combined with the shift from merchant x86 CPUs to custom ARM-compatible CPUs for both cloud computing and AI head node, create an entry point for Qualcomm. We're currently building NPU-based AI inference accelerator cards, as well as custom SoCs for general-purpose and AI head node compute solutions utilizing our Oryon CPU. We also reached an agreement to acquire Alphawave IP Group PLC, a global leader in high-speed wired connectivity and compute technologies for data centers, AI, data networking, and data storage. The acquisition is expected to close during Q1 2026, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAlphawave's leading IP and data center design capabilities are key assets that will complement our Oryon CPU and Hexagon NPU processors and help accelerate our roadmap. While we are in the early stages of this expansion, we are engaged with multiple potential customers, and are currently in advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler. If successful, we expect revenues to begin in the fiscal 2028 timeframe. Additionally, we signed an MOU with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers in Saudi Arabia and deliver highly efficient and scalable cloud-to-edge hybrid AI inferencing solutions for local and international customers. We also announced that our Oryon CPUs can be integrated with NVIDIA GPUs for high-performance NVIDIA AI factories using the NVIDIA NVLink Fusion architecture. We will provide further updates as we make progress.\nOver the past 12 months, we have continued to see AI and generative AI advance at an accelerated rate, and we're both excited and confident in the opportunities this is creating for Qualcomm across all our businesses. As GenAI changes the human-computer interface and agentic AI experiences continue to evolve, the mobile industry is being redefined, and a new generation of personal AI devices are emerging. Smart glasses and wearables, such as smartwatches, earbuds, and other form factors, are being transformed into personal AI devices as they connect the user directly to the AI agent and model. These devices are quickly transitioning from simply extending smartphone experiences to now providing new and unique personalized AI and agentic use cases. These devices will evolve independently of the smartphone ecosystem and become a significant opportunity.\nGiven our technology leadership in mobile, XR, and wearables, and the breadth of our P&P product portfolio, we expect to be the industry's preferred solution provider in this new category. Specifically, personal AI devices will require Snapdragon's always-on cloud connectivity, 5G and micropower Wi-Fi, power-efficient processing, on-device AI, best-in-class imaging, audio, video, sensors, and context capabilities. Meta AI smart glasses are currently the best example of personal AI. We're very optimistic about the trends we see in this area, with major AI players, application developers, and device makers investing in this space. Physical AI is another technology that is reshaping industries and creating new opportunities, particularly in robotics. Robotics require high-performance computing, including powerful on-device AI, extended battery life, reliable connectivity, a higher level of silicon integration, and advanced computer vision and sensor fusion to interpret and understand real-world information in real time and make decisions locally.\nThese requirements are perfectly aligned with our strengths in our technology and product portfolio. Our right to play in this new segment is similar to our expansion into automotive. Furthermore, our experience in industrial and safety-grade silicon, perception and sensing technologies, and ADAS and autonomy provide a very competitive foundation to develop highly differentiated solutions for autonomous robots, next-generation industrial automation, and humanoid robotics. We're incredibly excited about this opportunity, for which third-party estimates indicate a potential TAM of $1 trillion in the next decade. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Cristiano. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with our third fiscal quarter results. We delivered revenues of $10.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.77, which was near the high end of our guidance range. QTL revenues of $1.3 billion and EBITDA margin of 71% were above the midpoint of our guidance.\nQCT delivered revenues of $9 billion and EBITDA of $2.7 billion, with year-over-year growth of 11% and 22%, respectively.

This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To queue a question, press STAR then number one. To withdraw your question, press star two. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector of Semiconductors Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start with the handset market. I think you just spoke to 5% growth in the September quarter despite the lower share that you communicated at Apple. Can you speak to the drivers there? I mean, I think Xiaomi was up meaningfully in the quarter, which is typical in the June quarter, but I think investors are worried about some level of pull-ins. Are you seeing any evidence of that specifically related to China? Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nHi, Josh. It's Akash. We're not seeing any evidence of pull-in. I think the upside that we guided in the September quarter in handset revenue stream is really driven by our new product launch.\nAs I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to announce our new chip at the end of September, and we are already working with several OEMs for launch of new devices based on a tremendous interest in it. And what you're seeing is really people getting ready for launch of new devices.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector of Semiconductors Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thank you. And to follow-up, I wanted to ask about the data center business and the hyperscaler engagement you mentioned specifically. Any details you can give us on the scope of that engagement? Is that for an ARM-based CPU? Is it an accelerator? And you mentioned Fiscal 2028 as potential if that converts. Is that the right timeframe to think about contribution from your data center business more broadly at other customers as well? Thank you, and congrats on the results.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you. Thank you, Josh, for this, Cristiano. We can't really disclose more other than what we said in the script. We are in advanced discussions. We have been executing on a product. As we said before, we always felt that we had IP that were very relevant to the data center. I think the Alphawave provides complementary IP, allowing us to build custom SoC products, and we're pleased with the way we're developing this. I am sure we'll be able to share more as we probably conclude some of those discussions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Cristiano, maybe I can follow-up on the data center roadmap here or the sort of thought process and strategy around it. Less so maybe timing, but in terms of how do you envision sort of Alphawave integrating into the sort of portfolio or the stack capability that you have currently? And in relation to just thinking about sort of how you're going about selecting customers that you want to approach for this, what's typically sort of in terms of thinking about customization relative to standardization of the chipsets, how you're sort of thinking about deal sizes that would make sense for you in the longer run for this business? Any thoughts around that? Thank you. And I will follow.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nVery good. Thank you for your question. I know there's a lot of topics in that question. I'll try to probably give an overview. As we said before, and we said in the script, we have been focused on building two products. One is ability to leverage our CPU asset, and that happens in two situations. One, of course, is a general-purpose CPU. We have been very focused on hyperscalers that have first-party workloads for ARM-compatible CPU. The other one is the head unit for inferencing clusters. As AI started to get scale and we really look of how we're starting to see inference taking over training, there's a new dynamic in the marketplace, which is about ability to be efficient with tokens per dollar as well as energy. That creates an opportunity for us. For that, we have been building accelerator cards, and we will be building a rack as well. Those are the two areas that we're building product roadmap. We're very focused on customers that have the ability to put first-party workloads or inferencing clusters. The Alphawave IP, it's important.\nIt provides us the ability to scale out and provide connectivity. We believe it's leading connectivity in the industry, and that should inform you the type of customers that we've been focusing on. We think there's a very large TAM. As you know, there is an opportunity for Qualcomm to play if you have leading IP. Of course, as this is a new market for us and we have been planning for it, we're going to be very careful about making disclosures. We're going to wait until they become factual, and we're excited about the engagement we have today. We are in advanced negotiations with one significant customer, and hopefully that creates a halo effect that could validate our platform and create other opportunities down the road. Thank you.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you for that. And for my follow-up, in the handset business for the Fiscal Q3 here, you had 7% revenue growth year-over-year, which I think did sort of miss modestly your getting to last quarter for about 10% growth. So maybe if you can share any color in terms of if you did see any parts of the market that were weaker than you expected in the quarter. And then maybe similarly, when I think about your guidance for fiscal Q4 here, it looked like you're getting to about a high single-digit growth even with the impact of Apple. So maybe you can part it out in terms of this. The strength is because that seems like a pretty robust number for Fiscal Q4 even with the loss of Apple revenues?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. Samik, it's Akash. On the Q3, we had a slightly weaker mix than we had expected. As you know, this is a quarter that is seasonally weaker for us as there are no flagship launches. And that mix is really the weaker mix is more than offset by the strength you're seeing in the September quarter. Whereas I mentioned earlier to Josh's question, we're launching the new chip. We have flagship launches coming in at the end of the quarter, and we're seeing the demand increase because of that reason.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nStacy Rasgon (Bernstein Research\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst in US Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Given the guidance into September, but the dynamics around Apple and everything else, I mean, what would you consider normal seasonal into December quarter? And how should we think about drivers as you currently see them against that seasonal trend? How should we expect things? If there's anything else funky going on in December that we should know about that would influence results versus what might be more typical?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYes. Stacy, it's Akash. Assuming you're asking about the December quarter, we expect normal revenue seasonality for all businesses, of course, adjusted for the lower share in Apple phone launches that we've previously discussed, but nothing else to highlight in all other businesses.\n\nStacy Rasgon (Bernstein Research\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst in US Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment\n\nI mean, what would you consider normal seasonality then?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nWell, we're not specifically guiding the quarter at this point, but I think you've seen a trend in the last several years, and you'd expect the same quarterly trend just adjusted for the lower Apple volume for the share we've provided.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Moore, your line is live for a question. Perhaps you're on mute. Thank you. Our next question will be from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Wolfe Research\n\nYes. Thank you. If I could just expand upon some of the commentary with regard to the December quarter, my understanding is last year the Chinese OEMs started pulling forward the launch a little bit of some of the flagship devices. Also, as we were last year, there was an extra week in the quarter. And I guess maybe just some more granularity on the puts and takes on December, taking that into account. How much of a lift is that in the December quarter? And then does that turn into more of a headwind as you go into the March quarter?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. I think, Chris, the business remains very strong. So whether you look at the Android business, automotive, and IoT, all the trends continue with the growth rates that we've previously outlined for the business. So there's nothing significant or unique that I want to point out there. I think we've talked about the Apple share dynamics, so that is a factor. But outside of that, I think you should think of this as a very strong quarter for us. Seasonally, the strongest quarter for us is December, and that'll still be true regardless of the lower Apple share.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Okay. If I could follow on with the data center business and understand that you can't talk so much about some of the progress and design wins that you hope to have on that until they become factual. What about from a spending side? Moving into a new line of business, what's going to be the impact on spending? And then as Alphawave closes, what will be the effect of that on sort of revenue, expenses, and EPS?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So from a spend perspective, Chris, the way we've managed OpEx over the last several years, you've seen us very small growth in OpEx over the last four years. And the way we've managed it is really kind of absorbing the salary increases and reallocating existing spend towards diversification and growth. And really, the hiring as we go forward is really going to be focused on new skills that are required to execute on our plan. And so to the extent that there are new skills required to execute on the data center diversification assets, we will invest in that. But outside of that, we plan to be pretty careful managing OpEx going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director in Semiconductor Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. Just wanted to get into the OEM side. Akash, you've been very clear about what's happening on the Apple side of things, but recently you've seen Samsung launch a couple of models with its own processor. I just wondered, how do you compare and contrast that against the 8 Elite that you guys are rightly excited about going forward? Do you think you will maintain the 100% share on the Galaxy S generation, or is that decision not quite made yet? Any color on that would be helpful.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nHey, Ross, thanks for the question. We have been talking about the framework of our relationship with Samsung, and we have been executing multi-year, multi-generation agreement with Samsung. We have defined the new baseline of our share in the order of 75%. Anything above that is upside. So that's our planning assumption. And when we outperform, I think we end up you started to see what you saw in Galaxy S25.\nCompeting against the Samsung-owned platform is nothing new for Qualcomm. We've been doing that for decades. But I think historically, we have seen our relationship with Samsung continue to move up to higher level of share. And that's the baseline assumption. 75% is the baseline. That's the contract to a share. Everything above that is upside.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director in Semiconductor Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you for that color. I guess as a follow-up, and it probably would align to that also with enhanced sets. You've talked about at least the premium tier, flagship tier of having roughly double-digit ASP or content increases going forward with all the capabilities that you're offering. Does that still hold true? Does it accelerate, decelerate with the X85? Just any update on that would be great.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So if you think about our Android business in fiscal 2025, it grew over Fiscal 2024 by approximately 10%. So that is higher than the target we'd set at Investor Day. And it's a reflection of the strength of our roadmap, our competitive positioning, and the fact that this is a market where the volume is moving up to higher tiers where Qualcomm has a very strong position. The other thing I just want to highlight is we did give a metric both in mine and Cristiano's prepared remarks: over the last two years, kind of our non-Apple revenue stream in QCT has grown annually at more than 15%. So that should give you a key benchmark as you think about how the company's position to grow going forward as well. And this aligns with the Fiscal 2029 targets we set at Investor Day.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Tal, your line is live for a question. Perhaps you're on mute.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAbout China and fits. The proportion of China is going up. And if Samsung, you said, you're working with an assumption of 75% for Samsung. So if Samsung is going to go down from 100% for the Galaxy to 75%, China would further go up in percentage of QCT revenues. How do you see the China growth trends when it comes to the domestic market and international markets? What's the outlook from your perspective? What's the risk of competition within the Chinese market? Thanks. I have just a follow-up question on margins, but I'll keep it separate.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nTal, our position in China continues to be very strong. I think the evidence of that is the agreement that we announced with Xiaomi during the quarter. This is a multi-year agreement for premium phones with increasing volumes every year. They're going to use our chip for launches within China and globally as well. In addition, they'll also be the first OEM to launch with our next Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which comes out over the next couple of months. The relationship really has expanded over the last couple of years. We've gone from phones to automotive. They introduced smart glasses with our chips, wearables, tablets.\nSo it's a very broad relationship, and it's just an example of relationships we have with other Chinese OEMs as well. So you should consider this as a very well-positioned, sustained business for us. Within Samsung, as you can see in Fiscal 2026, they launched most of their devices with our chip, but they did launch Flip with their own. And so we're slightly below 100% share. And as we go to next year, I think our agreement, as Cristiano outlined, carries over, and we're in a very good position to maintain our scale there as well.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nSo let me just maybe add a different perspective. Tal, I'm going to agree with Akash, but I'll provide probably a comment of questions that we usually don't get. Look, we have been doing business in China for 30 years. We actually started down at a 3G.\nAnd I think what we learned by doing business in China, we actually learned how to move at China's speed. And I think if you look at the position in Qualcomm in China, they only improved over the years. And as Akash outlined, not only were we well-positioned in the phone business, we're well-positioned with some of the fastest-growing OEMs in the auto business. And that is expanding now into industrial, into robotics, and other areas. So another way to look into this is Qualcomm has become a very competitive company and learned how to compete in China and have been serving well. I think the market we expect to continue to be the case.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Maybe just a question on margins, a quick one. I see that when I look at the gross margin, operating margin, I see that there is, kind of, you managed to maintain a very healthy operating margin despite the fluctuations in Apple revenues. So, I just want to ask you a question I'm getting from investors quite often. What are the implications of the decline in Apple? What are the implications on margins? Are they positive or negative? Thanks.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, EVP, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. I think we're very happy with the margin profile of the business. I mean, we will be at close to 30% margin this year, which is the target we've set for the long term. As you look forward, the growth opportunity that we have in auto IoT far exceeds the scale of the Apple revenue. So, I think we have the ability to continue to grow revenue and manage the margin profile as a result of it. So no change to our long-term target margin versus what we've said in the past.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. I wanted to ask about the data center. You're buying Alphawave for $2.4 billion. You have big ambitions there, it sounds like, for FY 2028. What are your thoughts on having more of a tuck-in acquisition strategy there or even going bigger to get big fast and get a hold of customers if you have such great IP? I was just wondering if you'd kind of give us a little bit more of the strategy. Is it more Alphawave's coming, or would you ever consider a bigger acquisition? Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThanks, Ben, for your question. Look, at this point, we're very focused on actually driving Alphawave to closure and building our product roadmap. I think we feel that it provides the IP that is complementary to what we have and allows us to build a competitive position. This is a new initiative for Qualcomm, as I outlined. Like we have done for the rest of our business, as opportunity becomes available, we're always going to be looking at how to complement the roadmap. Right now, we're really focused on driving Alphawave to closure.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nAll right. Thanks. Can I just ask a quick follow-up on your comments around Gemini and Galaxy AI use in the Android area? Can you just draw that out a little more? Obviously, there's a perception that the Apple products are a little behind in AI. What that means for you over the long-term, whether you're really optimistic about that, maybe even past your fiscal Q1? And just any more color there? Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYes. Consistent to what we have been saying, we're starting to see AI use cases on phones to gain traction. There's also another interesting data point. I think if you look at the overall share of AI models, you see Gemini actually increasing dramatically over other models. We have seen, I think, the advantage of the Android ecosystem in terms of majority of AI as more and more use cases become agentic, or you started to see AI as part of the applications. I expect that it creates excitement about the Android ecosystem, expand its SAM, any drives, upgrade cycles. Those are all positive things from a mobile business.\nSo I will think that what AI is doing is making connectivity more relevant again, especially because of voice utilization, is driving more computing, more capable devices, and is actually changing the use cases. And the rate of utilization, it's very encouraging. What I said in the call about 3x between Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25, and I think I expect that to continue to accelerate.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before we're ending the call?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you all for attending the call. I'd like to thank our employees, our partners, and we appreciate following Qualcomm. We'll continue to execute on our strategy. We feel that the company is on the right trajectory, especially as we look for growth and diversification beyond handsets. And AI continues to be a great opportunity for us. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends, or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\nPlease refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Cristiano Amon.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q1, we delivered record revenues of $11.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.41. Our chipset business achieved record revenues of $10.1 billion, the first $10 billion quarter for QCT, including record quarterly Handset and Automotive revenues. Licensing business revenues were $1.5 billion.\nWe're off to a great start in fiscal 2025. Our mobile roadmap is the strongest in our history, with exceptional traction for Snapdragon in premium-tier handsets, and we are delivering growth across our diversification initiatives. This quarter, Automotive and IoT revenues grew 61% year over year and 36% year over year, respectively. We're committed to achieving $22 billion on non-handset revenues by 2029, as outlined during our 2024 Investor Day.\nOur advanced connectivity, computing, and edge AI technologies in product portfolio continue to be highly differentiated and increasingly relevant to a broad range of industries. We also remain very optimistic about the growing edge AI opportunity across our business, particularly as we see the next cycle of AI innovation and scale.\nDeepSeek-R1 and other similar models recently demonstrated that AI models are developing faster, becoming smaller, more capable, and efficient, and now able to run directly on-device. In fact, DeepSeek-R1 distilled models were running on Snapdragon-powered smartphones and PCs within just a few days of its release. As we enter the era of AI inference, we expect that while training will continue in the cloud, inference will run increasingly on-device, making AI more accessible, customizable, and efficient.\nThis will encourage the development of more targeted, purpose-oriented models and applications, which we anticipate will drive increased adoption and, in turn, demand for Qualcomm platforms across a range of devices. With the industry's most powerful and efficient AI processors for the edge, we're well-positioned to drive this transition and benefit from this upcoming inflection point. Let me now share some key highlights from the business. In handsets, we're pleased that the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S25 series of smartphones will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy globally.\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy delivers the latest AI experiences, showcasing one of the best integrations of Galaxy AI and Google Gemini. We are encouraged by the number of AI features, which has nearly doubled in the Galaxy S25 series. We expect this trend to continue as part of the transition to AI smartphones.\nWe're extremely proud of this launch and our long-standing strategic partnerships with Samsung and Google. As a reminder, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is our most powerful mobile platform today, featuring the industry's fastest custom CPU, the most powerful NPU, incredible GPU performance, and the best camera. In addition to Samsung, we're very pleased with the design traction and strong end-customer demand for recently launched Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered flagship smartphones by Chinese OEMs.\nOur design win momentum in PCs has also increased, with more than 80 designs in production or development on our category-leading Snapdragon X series platforms, and we're targeting more than 100 designs to be commercialized through 2026. Importantly, we recently announced our newest compute platform, the Snapdragon X, specifically designed to address PCs in the $600 price range, further expanding our addressable opportunity. Snapdragon X features best-in-class performance, multi-day battery life, powerful on-device AI, and Copilot+ experiences.\nWe look forward to PCs powered by Snapdragon X from leading OEMs, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, in the coming months. In partnership with Lenovo, we introduced the world's first mini desktop AI PCs powered by the Snapdragon X series.\nThese devices redefine compact computing in a new form factor ideal for developers, consumers, and enterprises. The number of NPU-powered on-device AI experiences running natively on Snapdragon has continued to grow, with more than 50 AI applications now optimized for Windows 11, including apps for enterprise collaboration, productivity, creativity, and more. Microsoft also announced it is bringing NPU-optimized versions of DeepSeek-R1 directly to Copilot+ PCs, beginning with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X series.\nAdditionally, the broader app ecosystem continues to expand, with Snapdragon-native apps now including 20 of the most popular VPNs, 50 of the most popular security and cloud storage apps, as well as new applications for creators. While we're still in the early phase of the transition to Copilot+ PCs, we are pleased with consumer reception for Snapdragon X series, which has exceeded our expectations.\nAccording to Circana, in December, Snapdragon X series had more than 10% share of the greater than $800 Windows laptops in US retail. In XR, we remain the preferred solutions provider for VR, MR, and AR across major OEMs and ecosystems, and our strategic long-term collaborations with Meta and other key partners are playing a key role in growing this area. The Snapdragon-based Ray-Ban Meta glasses continue to exceed expectations as they adopt more AI features.\nWe remain optimistic that we are at the beginning of an inflection point for smart glasses to gain scale as they become wearable AI. Additionally, at the recent XR Unlocked event, Google announced Android XR, and we are pleased that the first device available for purchase later this year will be built by Samsung and powered by the Snapdragon XR platform.\nWe continue to expand our industrial IoT portfolio of products and solutions, and we are encouraged by the positive reception across multiple industry verticals, including energy and utilities, robotics, manufacturing, warehousing and logistics, retail, enterprise, and commercial. At CES, we introduced our AI on-prem appliance and inference suite, which enables generative AI inference and computer vision workloads to run on dedicated on-premises hardware, allowing sensitive customer data, fine-tuned models, and inference loads to remain within the enterprise.\nThe AI inference suite provides ready-to-use AI applications and agents, tools, and libraries to easily operationalize AI and GenAI applications in a variety of deployments, on-premise or in the cloud. Our first-wave partners for these new platforms include Honeywell, IBM, and others. We also announced the next evolution of Qualcomm Aware, our cloud-based asset visibility platform.\nAs a horizontal enablement platform, Qualcomm Aware allows for a highly integrated way to add cloud-based observability and insights, geolocation, fine indoor positioning, firmware updates, and device management services to connected devices. In edge networking, we're pleased with the momentum in Wi-Fi 7, with recent product launches from Cisco, Charter, Eero, Netgear, Nokia, and Ubiquiti. We're also seeing strong traction for 5G fixed wireless access with next-generation design wins at operators in North America and India.\nWe continue to strengthen our position in automotive as the industry's leading technology partner for the software-defined vehicle, AI-powered in-cabin systems, advanced driver assistance, and connected car experiences. At CES, we announced new collaborations with Alps Alpine, Amazon, Google, Leapmotor, Mahindra, and Hyundai Mobis, which will use Snapdragon Digital Chassis solutions to drive AI-powered in-cabin and advanced driver assistance systems.\nWe also expanded our partnerships with several tier-one suppliers to now utilize the Snapdragon Cockpit Elite platform, including with Panasonic Automotive Systems, Garmin, and Desay SV. These collaborations will bring advanced intelligence, including generative AI, to all levels of software-defined vehicles, enabling automakers to build safe and extraordinary user experiences. We're very pleased with the strong industry reception to Snapdragon Cockpit Elite platform since its launch late last year.\nOur new collaboration with Hyundai Mobis will combine the Snapdragon Ride Flex system on chip and the Snapdragon Ride automated driving stack with Hyundai Mobis's cutting-edge software and sensors. This will deliver a comprehensive system solution that powers advanced infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems, bringing a one-of-a-kind user experience to future vehicles.\nAnother significant milestone was the launch of the Snapdragon digital chassis workbench, a cloud-based workflow for developers building the software-defined vehicle. To complement the hardware and software of the Snapdragon digital chassis, workbench provides a complete development and test environment to build and deploy automotive applications. Finally, we remain very pleased with the execution of our QTL business in recent years and were well-positioned to maintain fiscal 2024 revenue scale going forward.\nOver the past year, we've extended key agreements with major OEMs and were poised to shortly execute new long-term license agreements with two additional large OEMs. We also recently signed Transsion to a long-term 4G license to go along with the 5G license signed in the last fiscal year. Our progress reaffirms QTL as the industry's most extensive licensing program of cellular essential patents.\nBefore I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to provide an update on the Arm versus Qualcomm trial from December 2024. The jury's verdict vindicated Qualcomm's CPU innovations and affirmed that Qualcomm's contract with Arm provides a license for Qualcomm's products containing our proprietary Oryon CPUs in industries such as smartphones, automotive, next-generation PCs, IoT, and data center.\nIn addition, Arm recently notified us that it was withdrawing its October 22nd, 2024 notice of breach and indicated that it has no current plan to terminate the Qualcomm architecture license agreement. We're excited to continue to develop performance-leading world-class products that benefit consumers worldwide that include our incredible Oryon custom CPUs. I will now turn the call to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our record performance in the first fiscal quarter. We are pleased to announce revenues of $11.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.41, both of which were above the high end of our guidance. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBITDA margin of 75% were in line with expectations. QCT delivered record revenues of $10.1 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance on outperformance across Android handsets, IoT, and automotive.\nQCT handset revenues were a record $7.6 billion, with 13% year-over-year growth, reflecting higher volume and content increase in Android premium tier, driven by industry-leading performance of our newly launched Snapdragon 8 Elite platform. Higher volume in Android premium tier in the quarter was driven by stronger end-consumer demand for recently launched flagship smartphones and global share in Samsung Galaxy S25 devices. QCT IoT revenues of $1.5 billion increased 36% year-over-year, driven by new product launches with our industry-leading processors and on-device AI capability across consumer networking, and industrial.\nWe delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of record QCT automotive revenues of $961 million, representing 61% year-over-year growth on continued content increase in new vehicle launches as automakers deploy our high-performance, low-power computing, and connectivity chips to bring next-generation experiences to consumers.\nQCT EBITDA margins of 32% exceeded the high end of our guidance, reflecting the benefit of revenue upside and operating leverage. QCT EBITDA dollars of $3.2 billion increased by 25% versus the year-ago period. Lastly, we returned $2.7 billion to stockholders, including $1.8 billion in stock repurchases and $942 million in dividends. Now turning to guidance.\nFor the second fiscal quarter, we are forecasting non-GAAP revenues of $10.2 to 11 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.70 to 2.90. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.25 to 1.45 billion and EBITDA margins of 69% to 73%, reflecting normal seasonality for handset units. In QCT, we expect revenues of $8.9 to 9.5 billion and EBITDA margins of 29% to 31%, with strong year-over-year growth across handsets, IoT, and automotive.\nWe expect QCT handset revenues to grow by approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis, including the benefit of increased shipment for Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphones. On a sequential basis, the decline in QCT handset revenues is primarily driven by seasonality and shipments to Apple. We expect IoT and automotive revenues to grow by approximately 15% and 50%, respectively, versus the year-ago period, driven by the strong product momentum I just outlined.\nLastly, we estimate non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.25 billion. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong first-quarter results, with new records across the following metrics: total company revenue, non-GAAP EPS, QCT revenues, QCT handset revenues, and QCT automotive revenues. In QTL, we finalized renewal negotiations for long-term licenses with two key Chinese OEMs and expect to execute those agreements shortly.\nWe also recently signed Transsion to a long-term 4G license, in addition to the 5G license signed in the last fiscal year. With these additional long-term agreements, we expect fiscal 2025 QTL revenues to be consistent with fiscal 2024. Our recent product announcements at CES across PC, automotive, consumer, and industrial IoT, along with the continued performance leadership in premium-tier Android handsets, underscore our position as the connected computing leader across edge devices.\nLastly, as AI approaches an inflection point of scaling at the edge, our leadership in high-performance on-device inference solutions positions us to benefit as we lead this transition. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To queue a question, press the star, then the number one. To withdraw your question, press star two.If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. First question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess to start, I wanted to clarify the QTL guidance. So you're talking to sort of flat levels in fiscal 2025 versus 2024. I know you signed the two agreements recently. Could you maybe speak to how we should think about your assumptions on overall unit shipments and the royalty per unit tracking through the year? Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Joshua, it's Akash. I think our overall assumption on the market is that it is either flat or grows low single digits on a year-over-year basis.\nNow, of course, this doesn't take into account upside opportunities in terms of the China subsidy and the AI replacement rate. But the baseline assumption is what goes into the QTL forecast that we just gave.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. And I have a couple of questions, but maybe if I can start off on the PC platform and particularly Snapdragon X. Maybe, Cristiano, if you can sort of talk about how you're sort of thinking about 2025 and 2026 playing out in terms of device launches on your Snapdragon platform for PCs. And particularly, more interested in hearing how you're now thinking about the adoption curve between enterprises and consumers.\nWhat are you hearing from the OEM partners in terms of how to think about the adoption curve relative to enterprise and consumer as we go look for the next couple of years? And have a quick follow-up after that. Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nVery good, Samik. Thank you for your question. Look, we're very happy with the trajectory that we are on PCs. Maybe I'll start answering the question by providing some bookends, right? We said at the investor day last year that we expect to get $4 billion in Windows PC revenue by 2029. We actually said at that time, $4 billion out of a $35 billion, if I'm not mistaken, Sam, which if you calculate, you assume a share about 12% of the market we're addressing. I think we started very well with a number of designs. One metric that we have is the design traction continuum.\nWe have now over 80 design wins launched or in development across the X series, and we're targeting commercialization of more than 100 devices as we go to 2025 to 2026. So design traction is good. It continues to increase, which is a good sign. The second data point we actually provided on the script is, we look at the United States retail. We started to expand retail in different markets. We look at the United States, which was one of the priority markets that we had.\nThe data show that within the sale of US retail of Windows laptops above $800, we had more than 10% share, which is actually consistent with the projection we made of how we're going to grow in the five years. We liked the metric this early in the process. We're still starting. As I said, we'll continue to expand new markets.\nWe like the results today. The design traction is continuing to increase. The first wave was consumer. Now it's being deployed towards commercial. That's why we have emphasis on showing a lot of the commercial applications now native on Snapdragon, from VPN, from security, etc. We're excited, especially because of that. We launched a new product to expand the addressability to now $600 price laptops, which we're not compromising AI.\nAs I mentioned in the call, actually, a few days after Microsoft announced DeepSeek-R1 running on Snapdragon X Elite, X series laptops first. So actually, we're starting. We're happy with the traction. Consistent with our long-term projections. We're just going to keep executing.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Got it. No, thank you for that.\nMaybe for my follow-up, I can sort of take the cue from what Akash mentioned for the last question, which is China market for smartphones and the subsidies that you're seeing. Sort of what are you seeing on the ground in terms of response from the consumer to the subsidies? And what are you sort of thinking in terms of the impact to overall the Chinese smartphone OEM and their sort of growth sustainability?\nAnd I don't know if Akash, you gave the number in terms of what growth you saw with the Chinese OEMs, Chinese Android OEMs this quarter, but how are you thinking about sort of the growth trajectory going forward with them, particularly in light of these subsidies? Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nSure. So let me address it in parts. As it relates to the subsidy, as you know, they just began in January.\nSo we are not that far into the cycle. So we'll have a better view of it next quarter. In terms of historical reference point, in the past, we've seen that when subsidies have come in, it has improved the size of the market. So there is an opportunity that comes with it, but it's not something that is contemplated yet in our Q2 guidance. Now, let me go back to Q1 because that's where I made the volume comment as well. If you look at the Q1 upside that we had in handsets, very strong performance, record performance.\nThere were two drivers. First is the content increase year-over-year that we've discussed in detail as more capability gets added to the chipset. It shows up in our price points. The second was the volume increase that we saw on a year-over-year basis as well.\nWhen you really look at the volume increase and break it down into drivers, we had a higher share, of course, at Samsung. They're using us globally in the GS25. So that helps purchases that went into the December quarter before the phone launch.\nThe second is we saw higher end consumer demand in China for premium devices. And if you think about how that happens, it's a long-term trend that we've seen in China that the premium tier continues to grow. And it's a benefit that showed up in the quarter as well. The second is our customers are gaining share in the China market. And so that is a benefit that translates through as well. So we feel very good about all those drivers.\nThey're all kind of sustained long-term drivers in our business that position us well as we look at the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, I wanted to ask about the QTL guide flat year-over-year. So in the Q, it suggests that you're still negotiating with Huawei. And I'm assuming the QTL guide for Q2, which is a little lighter than normal, has no Huawei in it because of that. Does the annual guide for flat year-over-year assume that you do not settle Huawei? And if you do renegotiate and get some money for the would, there'll be upside to that number based on your current assumptions?\n\nAlex Rogers\n\nPresident of Global Markets, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, this is Alex. So thanks for the question, Stacy.\nSo basically, what we've managed to accomplish over the last year or so is essentially signing up everybody to extensions. So we've had a really good run of execution with bringing on Transsion for 4G, which is a significant development because they've popped up the ranks of OEMs in terms of unit volume, very high up the ranks, actually. So the 4G complements the 5G license that we have them signed up to, and they're transitioning to more 5G content in their overall product offering.\nAnd then we have these last two significant Chinese OEMs that we've signed up or that we've finished negotiations with, and the execution is just pending return from the Lunar New Year holiday. The Huawei discussions are still in play. So the numbers don't actually include the potential from a renewal with Huawei. And basically, everything else is taken care of.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGot it. So that flat guidance doesn't include any Huawei settlement, to be clear?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nCorrect. Neither the second quarter guidance or the full year comment.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGot it. That's great. And for my follow-up, I just want to note, you've seen a fair amount of just, in general, personal electronics strength recently. And there's some thoughts that maybe some of it might be related to sort of pre-tariff pull forwards. I don't know if you guys would be able to have any view on that, but do you have any comments on what you might see and whether or not the threat of tariffs might be driving some pre-builds or increased demand in the near term?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, absolutely not. I think it's funny, Stacy. We expected everybody to be asking this question. We actually are seeing it's pretty simple, right?\nSo, number one is higher than expected, I think, share of Samsung with the launch of Galaxy S25 globally. The second thing is end customer demand in China. We have data on the sell-through. It is basically Snapdragon 8 Elite has been quite successful. Demand on smartphones launching will actually exceed our expectations. It's built on what Akash said. The trend of premium tier continues to expand. Smartphone is number one consumer electronic device purchase. I think there is a positive launch of AI features.\nCustomers build great devices. They are gaining share in the premium tier. That is what we're driving demand. As Akash outlined, all of our smartphone, all of our smartphone products, products from our customers in China using 8 Elites, the price points that they launch those devices in the market, they're all eligible for the subsidy.\nThat's not contemplated in the Q2 guide, which it could be an interesting development. We saw they usually further expand the premium tier. But this is no inventory. This is no build-out ahead of tariffs. This is end customer demand.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, thanks. Good evening. I guess following on with those comments, Cristiano, how should we think about June quarter now? Because typically, June quarter, there are no flagship launches, and that has some effect on QCT. Given the share gain at Samsung, does that affect the seasonality for June at all? And how should we be thinking that in general?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. I think, Chris, you're right in terms of understanding our seasonality.\nWhen you look at the last several years, kind of the framework across quarters, it is driven by the timing of the flagship launches. So as a result, we expect kind of Q1 to be the high point from an EPS perspective, and Q3 is the low point because you don't have as many flagship launches in it. On your question specifically on Samsung, Samsung is in kind of the impact of the higher share is included in the Q1 and the Q2 guide as well. So it will be included in Q3 and Q4 as well. I don't think it fundamentally changes the seasonality across the quarters.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. As a follow-up, if you could address some of the higher price points that you're seeing on Snapdragons now. And certainly, there are more features in there because of AI.\nBut to some extent, it's also about cost too because the waiver costs are higher. What's the impact of that on Qualcomm, not just from a quarter basis, but looking a little bit out? Should we expect ASP to be a tailwind for you? And then how are your OEM customers dealing with that? Is it a factor of we're just going to see a mix higher to higher-end phones, or is that going to result in higher ASP?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nChris, the primary driver here is that there is a consumer demand for more capable smartphones. And so as we go from generation to generation, we're adding a lot more capability on the processing side, on AI side, and connectivity. And that is showing up in the price points in our chip. So that's the primary driver.\nOf course, as you're aware, TSMC price increases for 3 and 4 nanometer did kick in in January. And so, as we've said in the past, our objective there is to reflect the cost increases in ASPs over a period of time. So those are the key drivers. When you step back, I think one of the messages that Cristiano gave earlier is an important one: the overall market. It's not just about each tier kind of having a more capable chip, but a mix shift across tiers and a larger market for premium devices.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just want to ask a more cyclical question, probably most applicable to your IoT segment.\nThat business has been very strong year-over-year, but you've had a couple of quarters with negative sequential comps. Is that just normal seasonality, or is there cyclicality involved that some of your broad-based peers are seeing? Just kind of want to judge where we are in that cyclical trend.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Ross. There's definitely one of the big drivers on the quarterly profile is because of consumer IoT. And that does have cyclicality involved because you're building for the holiday season. And then when we get into the March quarter, of course, you're past that point. When you look at the other two parts of our IoT business, which is industrial, and edge networking, we're consistently seeing strength across the quarters.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat to hear. I guess as a follow-up question, then switching gears to the gross margin, Akash, congratulations again.\nIt looks like you kept that in QCT pretty much flat sequentially, despite your thought that it was going to go down in the December quarter. Is that something that is just structurally going to be a little higher than that, I guess, kind of implied 48% to 49% range? And if so, what's changed?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. The gross margin, both in our December quarter and our March quarter, benefits from the fact that we have stronger premium tier volume. That improves the overall mix of our portfolio, and that shows up in gross margin. So that's the primary driver of the strength. And so, as you see the mix changes, it will flow through the margin numbers. But yeah, we are very happy, just like you, that the margins have been very strong.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nPlease proceed with your questions. Thanks a lot. I had two. Cristiano, is there any evolution in the way you're thinking about the modem situation at your large customer? I know there's been some back and forth on that recently. Is there any change there? Are you feeling like maybe you'll be there a little bit longer than you had expected? That's the first question.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. The answer is no. I think we're really operating with the assumptions. I think we've been very clear. I think what those things are. We expect 20% share for the launch that happens in 2026. And the current agreement ends after that. We are assuming no renewal, which means nothing in 2027. For 2025 launches, we expect share to be between 100% and 20%. So we don't know. But I think we've been very clear about how we're modeling that business.\nAnd I think that's the assumption going forward.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Akash, can you give us an idea of how big the PC business was within IoT? You said you were 10%, I think, of the $800 or, sorry, the above $800 laptop market in the US. I'm guessing you did about $100 million, a little bit more than $100 million in December. Is that close? Thanks.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Tim, it's Akash. So from an overall revenue perspective, I think the way we've set it up is we've set targets long-term for 2029 for each of these areas. And we plan to give an annual update on each of those targets. So we're not breaking it down every quarter by area. To me, what's the most important thing on the PC is the market that we were playing in, which is devices over $800.\nOur focus on retail to begin with, we're very happy that we were able to get 10% share. I think just as Cristiano said earlier, if you equate that to our long-term target, which is 12% of the overall market, that's a great start towards the number we'd set up.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. I want to focus on a 20% growth of smartphones and QCT this quarter. The question is, how long will this continue? The market itself is not growing. There was last quarter, there was growth in China that was very strong. This quarter, we have the initial of Samsung. So can you talk about longevity of the current trends? How long can it continue? Could you grow even if the market doesn't grow?\nThen just an update on China demand. Thanks.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nSure, Tal. So let me break it down. If you look at our year-over-year performance in QCT handsets, we were up 13%. As I said earlier, the drivers of those is really a combination of higher volume and higher ASPs. The ASPs as content increase, which we've talked about, we've seen consistently that continue to increase over the last several years. As we look forward, we think that's very sustainable. Just we're adding a lot more capability to the device, and the consumers are looking for that opportunity.\nIn terms of volume, one of the key metrics for us is the fact that the premium tier continues to grow. So if you look at the last three or four years, devices greater than $400 have gone from being 21% of the market to now over 30% of the market.\nAnd so that is a trend that's incredibly positive for us because that's the market that we are very strong in. And so we have a combination of the units within that part of the market is growing very quickly, and within that, our content is growing as well. And those are the two factors that drive the handset growth of 13% on a year-over-year basis. When you look at the March quarter, we're guiding handset growth of 10% on a year-over-year basis, which is, again, a very strong number. So pretty happy with how we are set up in that business, and both in the first half of the year, and it positions us well as we look forward.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nChina update?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nCan you repeat your question on that, Tal, please?\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nI said just China. China was strong the last few quarters. Can you give, maybe I missed it, but what's the current trends in China?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. I think China definitely is strong in the premium tier. We've seen that part of the market grow. We've also seen our customers gain share within that market. And then last thing is we're going to have subsidies come in. And so that is a potential that benefits that part of the market as well. So pretty, I think, positive tailwinds for us there.\nThank you. That concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call? Just I'd like to."

Mr. Lopez-Hodoyan, please go ahead.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Cristiano Amon and Akash Palkhiwala. In addition, Alex Rogers will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on Qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our website later today. During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends, or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\nPlease refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. And now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Cristiano Amon.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q3, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $9.4 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.33, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenues from our chipset business of $8.1 billion reflect the sequential growth in automotive and IoT, and continued traction of our Snapdragon mobile platforms across leading smartphones. Our automotive and IoT revenues were the result of ongoing execution of our diversification strategy. Licensing business revenues were $1.3 billion. Now, I would like to share some key highlights from the business. In automotive, we secured more than 10 new design wins with global automakers during the quarter. These include next-generation digital cockpit connectivity and/or ADAS, and autonomy. Our Snapdragon Digital Chassis continued to scale across virtually all OEMs and is now a key asset for the automotive industry.\nAs we look forward, we're focused on extending our industry-leading on-device AI solutions to the Snapdragon digital chassis to enable automotive-centric GenAI use cases and applications. It's important to note that our architecture, with capabilities across all domains, is uniquely positioned to enable sensor data to be utilized simultaneously for ADAS autonomy workloads and user-centric GenAI experiences in the digital cockpit. A great example is our Snapdragon RIDE Flex solution, which combines digital cockpit and ADAS on a single SoC. Future drivers for automotive growth include GenAI experiences, the software-defined vehicle transition, central computing replacing microcontrollers, expansion into two-wheelers, and car-to-cloud services. In handsets, we are pleased that all Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, delivering extraordinary AI capabilities, premium-level performance, and power efficiency for foldable devices.\nTogether with Samsung and our other partners, we continue to push the boundaries of on-device GenAI on mobile devices. To that end, we're pleased with the growth and trajectory of AI use cases on smartphones. This continued expansion of AI features is a precursor to next-generation smartphones, which we believe will become AI-centric, with pervasive on-device AI working across applications in the cloud. Qualcomm is very well positioned to help drive this transformation across the industry in the coming years. At our upcoming Snapdragon Summit in October, we will reveal details of our next-generation Snapdragon 8 flagship mobile platform, the first to be powered by our custom Oryon CPU. This platform, combined with new and unparalleled NPU AI capabilities, is already exceeding both our and our customers' performance expectations.\nIn compute, we're very pleased that Copilot+ PCs, powered exclusively by Snapdragon X Series platforms, became available for purchase on 18 June 2024. This marks the start of one of the most significant transitions in personal computing since the launch of Windows 95 and is restoring performance leadership back to the Windows ecosystem. 20 Copilot+ PCs from Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer, Asus, and Samsung are now available across 20 countries and 47 retailers. It's important to highlight the unique Copilot+ and Snapdragon X Elite dedicated retail spaces in Best Buy, Costco, Currys, Harvey Norman, and many more. We are very pleased with the initial response, with several models sold out at retailers and online. Our retail presence is expected to expand to more than 60 retailers across 25 countries in the coming months.\nWe're also working closely with more than 50 global commercial customers to drive Snapdragon readiness in their respective environments. Additionally, we added the Snapdragon X Series platforms to the Qualcomm AI Hub, allowing developers to easily take advantage of optimized AI models to create responsive, power-efficient, and compelling on-device generative AI applications for Copilot+ PCs. As we look forward to 2025, we are already working with OEMs on the next wave of Copilot+ PCs. In addition to new design wins, our X Series product roadmap will expand to address PCs with retail prices as low as $700 without compromising NPU performance. Longer term, we believe the benefits of Snapdragon X Series platforms make it clear that the PC ecosystem has begun the transition to an architecture. As we look forward, we're forecasting that at least 50% of PCs will be AI-capable by 2027.\nGiven our clear technology leadership and competitive roadmap, we expect to be positioned as one of the top silicon suppliers for these devices. We also remain excited about the continued positive momentum in XR, particularly the success of Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. Sales exceeding our expectations due in part to the integration of Llama into the experience. We foresee an acceleration in demand for extended and mixed reality devices as new use cases enabled by GenAI gain scale. Snapdragon XR remains the industry platform of choice, and we are engaged with major ecosystem players, including Meta, Google, Microsoft, and others. Most recently, at the Augmented World Expo, we showcased two of the latest XR devices, NTT's augmented reality glasses and Sony's upcoming head-mounted mixed reality device.\nIn industrial IoT, we're pleased to report that we're now collaborating with Aramco on connectivity, AI, and advanced computing solutions for industrial and enterprise use cases in Saudi Arabia. This also includes accelerating development of the industrial 4G, 5G, and non-terrestrial networks ecosystem, including the first significant wide-area private cellular network for IoT. As the industrial sector is transformed by AI, we expect an increase in demand for more complex on-device processing. This trend aligns well with our core capabilities, especially the computing and AI roadmap we have built for auto and PC. As high-performance processing and intelligence at the edge becomes critical for the next phase of enterprise digital transformation, we see a unique opportunity to build a leadership position in this space.\nIn the next few months, we will announce our new dedicated product roadmap for industrial IoT, including support for multiple operating systems, ability to run multi-billion-parameter AI models, and a comprehensive development platform. Finally, we're very pleased to share that we recently signed a key long-term licensing agreement with Honor, a leading Chinese smartphone OEM. We continue to be pleased with the company's diversification beyond mobile, and we're particularly proud of what we have accomplished to date in automotive and PC. We will provide additional updates on our diversification strategy at our Investor Day in New York on 19 November 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our third fiscal quarter earnings. We're pleased to announce strong non-GAAP results with revenue of $9.4 billion and EPS of $2.33, both of which were above the midpoint of our guidance. QTL revenues of $1.3 billion and EBITDA margin of 70% were in line with our expectations. QCT delivered revenues of $8.1 billion and EBITDA margin of 27%, which was at the high end of our guidance range, driven by upside in both IoT and automotive. QCT handset revenues of $5.9 billion were in line with expectations, reflecting our scale in premium Android handsets and greater than 50% year-over-year growth in revenues from Chinese OEMs. QCT IoT revenues increased 9% sequentially to $1.4 billion as we continue to see a gradual recovery in the industry environment.\nWe delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of record QCT automotive revenues of $811 million, with sequential growth of 34%. Our revenue acceleration reflects content growth in new vehicle launches as we become the leading supplier of advanced computing and connectivity solutions to the automotive industry. Lastly, we returned $2.3 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including $1.3 billion in stock repurchases and $949 million in dividends. Before turning to guidance, I would like to outline three factors included in our forecast. First, consistent with our long-term financial planning assumption of largely flat handset units, we continue to estimate global 3G, 4G, 5G units in calendar 2024 to be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. Second, our license to export products to Huawei, which was set to expire in late calendar 2024, was revoked on 7 May 2024.\nThis change will impact our revenues in both the current quarter and the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Lastly, our fourth fiscal quarter includes an additional week as we align our fiscal reporting period with the calendar quarter end every five to six years. Now turning to fourth fiscal quarter guidance, we are forecasting revenues of $9.5 to $10.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.45 to $2.65. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.35 to $1.55 billion and EBITDA margins of 70% to 74%, reflecting normal seasonality for handset units. In QCT, we expect revenues of $8.1 to $8.7 billion and EBITDA margins of 27% to 29%. We expect QCT handset revenues to grow by low single-digit percentage sequentially.\nThis forecast reflects an increase in purchases from a modem-only handset customer, partially offset by seasonally lower Android revenue ahead of our new Snapdragon premium chipset launch in Q1 of fiscal 2025. We expect QCT IoT revenues will increase by low double-digit percentage sequentially, driven by growth across consumer, networking, and industrial. Following our outperformance in Q3, we expect QCT automotive revenues to remain flat in Q4 fiscal quarter. We are on track to deliver approximately 50% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2024, providing confidence in our ability to execute our long-term targets. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.2 billion. In closing, we are pleased with our execution and financial performance in fiscal 2024. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are on track to deliver strong non-GAAP EPS growth of approximately 20% relative to fiscal 2023.\nOver the last quarter, industry support for our vision for on-device AI has accelerated and been validated by several key players. Beyond handsets and PCs, we expect on-device AI to drive competitive differentiation for us in industrial, networking, automotive, and XR. Our leading technology and product portfolio has positioned us to continue to execute on our diversification strategy, and in the months ahead, we look forward to introducing new industry-leading products across all our end markets. Finally, as Cristiano outlined, we'll be hosting our Investor Day on 19 November, where we'll provide an update on our IoT and automotive diversification strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nTo queue a question, press star, then the number one. To trigger a question, press star two. If you're using speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. First question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. I have a couple of questions, guys, really highlighting some of the diversification the company is now starting to deliver on in the revenue. I guess the first one is in the automotive business. Some pretty big upside there. And maybe you could talk a little bit about that you're seeing some of this revenue come through now in OEM programs that no doubt you won two or three years ago. Do you think that continues as we roll through the next several quarters? I mean, what kind of momentum could we see as some of these units start to roll out from, like I said, programs you won a long time back? And then, Cristiano, the second one, people keep asking lots of questions about AI PCs.\nAs you know, you're getting really close here to when the holiday ramp period would start for you to sell in units. So maybe you could give us your current take on your expectations of what the PC market could bring in terms of units or revenue for your company as we look forward into the next fiscal year. Thanks, guys.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nVery good. Thank you, Matt. Thanks for asking the questions. Let me start with automotive. Look, we're very pleased with automotive performance. And I want to start by saying this: you continue to see signs of the pipeline translated into revenue. There are a couple of things we really like it. The first one is our automotive revenue is all about share of new cars being launched with our content. Also, it's independent whether the industry is about internal combustion or EV because it's all about digital. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis really became a key asset for the automotive industry. And just within the quarter, we have not only the launch of 10 new models with our technology, but also we actually have 10 new design wins, which continue to add to the pipeline. So we're very excited about that.\nWe'll continue to see, as new cars get launched with our technology from the pipeline, the revenue to grow. As Akash said in the script, we're actually on track to the metric we provided for $4 billion in 2026. One side comment on your question. An upside is what GenAI is doing in automotive. GenAI use cases, especially using large language models for audio, is a great user interface for more behind the wheel. We're starting to see a lot of interesting use cases being developed. That upside to our model, it could be an upgrade of content in the digital cockpit that we have in. The second comment, which is about PCs, I will start by saying we're very pleased. It's exceeding our expectations. It's a new version of Windows. The Copilot+ is a new architecture with an ARM-compatible.\nWe expect that that will ramp over a period of time. But what we have seen in the market right now with the 20 models that get launched is exceeding our internal targets. Some models, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, had sold out. And I think we should expect that that will continue to be a crescendo, slow and steady as the market transition. We will have new product announcements coming up at IFA, and you're going to continue to see more Copilot+ features coming from Microsoft. We're very happy about that. As the same thing we did with Auto, we expect PC to be the next biggest driver of diversification for the company. And we'll continue to track every quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the strong print here. I guess, Cristiano, if I start you off with a smartphone question here related to AI smartphones. One, can you share if you're seeing any appreciable difference in the demand for smartphones with AI features in them from consumers already? And as you look to the pipeline in terms of design wins for next year, how are you thinking about proliferation of the AI features and capabilities into more mid-tier or outside of the flagship-tier phones that you work with your customers, and have a follow-up? Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you for your question, Samik. So on smartphones, I will start by saying one thing that we really like, and I think it was reflected by some of the metrics provided by Akash, as he talks about in his remarks, 50% growth within China with Chinese OEMs. So AI has expanded the size of the premium tier. So even in a market which is kind of flattish to low single-digit in growth, the premium tier is actually growing faster. And we've seen that. We've seen a larger premium tier enabled by AI. And to your specific question, we are happy with the trajectory of AI features. We used to have a few. Now we have tens of AI features. And eventually, when they get to hundreds, we're going to start to see a change that a smartphone with AI feature will become an AI smartphone.\nWe don't have any heroic assumptions in our model, but we actually like the direction this is going. That could create an interesting upside if we have an AI-driven upgrade cycle. Still early in the process, but the use cases are becoming more interesting. I pointed to the increase of use cases in the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6. China has a number of use cases. They're going to be launching the next flagship. And I know you asked about bringing AI to the mass tier. We intend to do that. The same thing we're doing with the PC, which is as we expand the roadmap, we're not compromising on AI capabilities. We're going to see us doing that within our mobile roadmap. But on the premium tier, I'm actually very excited given the upcoming launch of our next Snapdragon that has our custom CPU.\nYou're going to see the same shift in performance that we have done in the PC ecosystem, restoring the performance back to the Windows ecosystem. You're going to see doing something similar in phones. AI is going to be a big part of this story. Thank you.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. A quick one for Akash. Akash, the guide for September revenues, that looks pretty similar to what you were sort of soft guiding us to back sort of 90 days ago, although you now have incremental headwinds with the license to export to Huawei. How should we think about sort of where you're finding the offsets? Where is the upside to help you offset that incremental headwind? Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nYeah. Thanks, Samik. Samik, we're pretty happy with the way the quarter's played out, right? If you look at our handset business, we are growing. We're guiding that we'll grow low single-digit percentage on a quarter-over-quarter basis. IoT, we're guiding low double-digit growth, and we're seeing strength across industrial, edge networking, and consumer. And then auto, coming off of an extremely strong quarter in June, we're guiding flat revenue in the September quarter. And so all of these, both IoT and automotive, are incremental to our previous expectations. And you're seeing that benefit show up in our guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nYes, hi. I guess first question is just a clarification on the extra week in the quarter that you referred to. Can you speak about what impact you might expect that to have on both revenue and cost, and if there's any implications on that, that absence of the extra week as you go into the following quarter, which is obviously a seasonally strong quarter?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nYeah, sure, Chris. If you think about the two factors I outlined for the guidance, which is the extra week on one hand and then offset by the Huawei reduction, revenue reduction on the other side, those two largely offset each other. So the net impact on our overall guidance is pretty limited when you consider the impact of both factors. Specifically on the extra week, as you know, not all weeks are created equal as you think about the different parts of our business. So what we factored in is incremental revenue on the QCT side, incremental OpEx on the OpEx side, and then within, sorry, incremental revenue on the QTL side. And then within QCT, revenue forecast and the benefit that we have from a flagship phone launch, that doesn't really change based on the number of weeks.\nSo that remains largely consistent, and these factors are already included in. But kind of the big message is when you step back and look at the two key factors I outlined, they pretty much cancel out against each other.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nOkay, understood. Then moving over to QTL, the guidance for the fourth quarter is, it's outside of the range that you have been talking about before. You haven't changed your expectation for global handset units. Can you speak to the reason for the QTL guidance and if that's sustainable going forward? Because typically the first quarter is a stronger quarter for that segment.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nYeah, sure. So the QTL guidance is relatively straightforward. If you look at June to September, we typically see very small growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So we factored that in. And then we have the extra week on top of it as well, which is also factored into our numbers. So that's how we got to the number we're guiding for QTL.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, AB Bernstein\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask the second half of Chris's question again that you didn't quite get to. The extra week, how should I think about the implication for December quarter seasonality coming off of that? What are you guys thinking for December? If you could help us shape that a little bit.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nSure, Stacy. So as you know well, we typically grow into the first quarter, into the December quarter, and we're expecting that it's a seasonally strongest quarter of the year going forward. And as we think about the quarter, there are a couple of factors we consider. First is the launch of our new Android premium-tier chip, which is going to be a tailwind for us. We do go back from the 16 weeks o 14 weeks back to 13 weeks within the quarter. And then relative to last year, we'll not have Huawei product revenue going forward, which we did have last year. So net of all of this, when you look at a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue to be largely revenue growth to be largely consistent with the year-over-year growth we saw in December quarter last year.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, AB Bernstein\n\nGot it. That's helpful. If you could also just give us any sort of incremental color, how much of the guide actually includes how much of the guide is PC revenue at this point for next quarter? I know you said the consumer piece sounds like it's growing in IoT. That's where it is. But how much of it actually is PCs?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nYeah. I mean, Stacy, in all candor, we're a few weeks into our launch. So it's too early to kind of have either a bullish assumption or a specific assumption on PC. We do have indications from our customers, and we've tried our best to factor it in as we usually do. But as Cristiano said, to us, this is about kind of the longer-term growth opportunity. And being very specific on sell-through in the short term is not really something that we have insight into. But we will, as we get to Investor Day, we're going to give a lot more disclosure in our specific plans on revenue ramp.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to come back to the 50% growth in China handset. It sounds like you talked about growth in the premium tier there. Can you kind of give us a sense of how much of that is price versus units? Is the market expanding? Then maybe market share commentary because your numbers seem better than your competitor.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nYeah. So if you look at the total handset market, our general assumption is that from 2023 to 2024, it's flat to slightly up. So the market is not growing. But within that, the premium tier, the trend has been very positive. We've gone from greater than $400 representing 21% of the market now to representing 31% of the market. And so that's very significant growth that we are benefiting from. And as you know, we are very strong at the premium tier. And as that market expands, we get to participate in that, not just from a revenue perspective, but content increase perspective as well.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Susquehanna International Group, LLP\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess in your latest Q, you talked about a bunch of new licenses coming up. I think they expire early fiscal 2025, including Huawei. I guess, first of all, the 4G at Huawei, would this might affect these negotiations? Do you expect everyone else to sign in those negotiations as well? And then lastly, do we think about Huawei, that impact is roughly $150 million a quarter? Is that a fair number on the 4G stuff from Huawei? Thank you.\n\nAlex Rogers\n\nEVP and President, Qualcomm\n\nHey, Chris. This is Alex. Thanks for the question. So if you look at the licensing progress, basically over the last year or so, we set out to execute on a number of renewals and extensions. We've done actually a really good job doing that. The most recent was getting Honor signed up to a long-term agreement. Then, as you know, Apple extended through 2027. We also noted recently that we have two major Chinese OEMs signed long-term. We haven't named them, but they're significant handset manufacturers. We're working through negotiations with others that we still have optimistic expectations in terms of getting them signed up. We also recently announced that we signed up Transsion to a 5G license. We're still negotiating with them.\nThere's some litigation ongoing, but I think the important thing is to focus on the 5G license with that company and the ongoing negotiations. So Huawei is a company that we've been engaged with, just like the others, in terms of trying to move negotiations forward. We expect that to continue. We don't really have any news on that just yet.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nFrom a revenue breakdown perspective, as you know, we don't break down our QTL revenue by OEM. A reasonable way of thinking about it is look at the scale of the market and the number of units any specific OEM contributes to the scale of the market, and apply that to our overall revenue stream.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. One question, one follow-up. Thanks for letting me ask them. First, one probably more for Cristiano. I just wanted to see how you feel with your leadership position on both the modem and the apps processor side in your handset business. How do you feel about the relative market share that you'll have in the penetration at given customers? There's kind of perpetual debate about what you're doing with your lead Korean customer year to year, gen to gen, same thing with your modem-only customer. So as you look forward over the next year or two, how are you feeling about the penetration that Qualcomm can have at the major customers?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nAll right. Thanks for your question, Ross. Loaded questions. So I'm going to have to unpack one by one. I think the first part of the question, how do we think about our modem technology? We feel pretty good about our modem technology. I think this is one of the core competencies of the company. We continue to be the number one company in the country in number of wireless patents, and standard essential patents and continue to be the company pushing forward the roadmap. As it relates to our business with Apple, we still operate with the framework that we provided to you all. I think when we extended the chipset agreement, we expect to be operating within that. We have no new update to provide. Everything above what we said before is an upside.\nSo we don't have that in our financial planning assumptions above what we had disclosure. When we think about the application processor, I think the conversation is a little bit more interesting because we have always had the leadership in AI performance. We always had the leadership in sustained peak and sustained performance in mobile gaming, and other applications with our Adreno GPU. And now, for the first time in a while, we're going to have our own custom CPU, which will be announced at the Snapdragon Summit and will be in the flagship devices launching towards the end of the year, beginning of 2025. So I will argue that our application processor advantage is accelerating. And as I said in this earnings, I think the launch of the Copilot+ PC was really graduation for Qualcomm as it used to be perceived as a communications company.\nIt's really a computing company to the point that now we become the benchmark for others to follow within the PC industry. And I think that is going to be reflected in the handset as well as we have our own custom CPU. As it relates to relationship with Samsung, we have executed agreements with them. It's largely consistent to what you have seen with the launch of the Galaxy S24. How's that going to continue? We're pretty happy with the relationship. And I think we both have a lot of opportunity with the AI coming into premium smartphones. Thank you.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, Cristiano. I guess that's my follow-up for Akash. One, in the answer to your prior question, you said that your year-over-year growth in December would be about the same as it was last December. Just a clarification, was that just for QCT? And then I guess my bigger picture question, how should we think about gross margins in QCT going forward? Looks like you're implying them down a bit in the September quarter, but still flat year-over-year. As the diversification process happens, automotive, PCs, etc., how should we think about that line in your income statement?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nSure. So that comment was really focused on overall company. So not just QCT, but the overall Qualcomm metrics. From a gross margin perspective, we did slightly better than we expected. We had guided in third quarter. And what we're doing is we're guiding fourth quarter in line with the guidance we had provided for third quarter. I think as you look forward beyond fourth quarter into fiscal 2025, using fourth quarter as a way to model the going forward path is a reasonable way of thinking about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Can you hear me?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nYes, we can.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Perfect. Sorry. So I need help to define your addressable market in compute, meaning is it mostly about consumer laptops, enterprise? How do you envision your addressable market in the compute segment? And the second thing is you talked a lot about AI, AI inclusion in handsets. When we talk to carriers, they seem to be far away from it in the sense that they can't find the applications yet. What do you think is going to drive the deployment? What kind of applications and what's the timing of applications that will drive the deployment of AI in handsets? Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nHello, Tal. This is Cristiano. Thank you for your question. Let me take the first one. You should think about addressable market the following way. First of all, it's Windows 11 addressable market. We're very focused right now on laptops, whether it's commercial laptops for enterprise, consumer laptops. We're ranging price points, I think, especially as we talk and prepare remarks, extending the roadmap from $700 and above. What is defined as AI PC, a metric that I can provide to you. I think there has been a number of OEMs indicating their respective views. But we forecast about 50% of all computers sold in 2027 will be AI PCs. That's one way to think about it. We continue to basically see the transition of as upgrades are happening to Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs, an opportunity for us to participate with a highly differentiated solution.\nI think your second question.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nIt was on AI applications.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nIt was about AI applications for devices. So here's how you should think about it. AI is going to do on phones, whether you're going to text, whether you're going to talk, whether you're going to touch, is going to be a very important part of the human-computer interface. And this is going to start to change a lot of the user experience on apps. It's less of a carrier conversation. It's really more of an application conversation. And those are going to start to change a lot of the use case of existing apps, or you're going to start to see, as we see the development of new agents, that become more relevant. For example, if you are like me, a user of WhatsApp, you're going to see the ability within WhatsApp for you to search with Llama for you to do different things with their model.\nEventually, a lot of the models are going to have multiple functionality across multiple apps. The way to measure this is the number of use cases. As I said before, we're actually very happy with the trajectory. I like to compare what happened with the smartphone. When the smartphone first, there were like 10 apps, and then became 100 apps, and became thousands of apps, became hundreds of thousands of apps, and then it became very clear what was happening. I think we look at AI a little bit the same way. We're in the beginning, but we like the number of use cases increasing, and that's going to drive a lot more AI NPU performance in the silicon and hopefully continue to expand the premium and high tier. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question is from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays Investment Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. I had one for Cristiano and one for Akash. Just very recently here, obviously in the quarter, there's a huge step up in the auto portfolio. And I think you guys did a good job of kind of describing what drove that. But you've also, in your deck and kind of in your commentary, talked more about AI PC being a driver. Cristiano, if you look at kind of the next 12 months, you hosted an auto analyst day, and you kind of talked about the opportunity being backend loaded. And I think the end date was kind of the late 2020s. But if you look at the next 12 months, what opportunity do you think is more exciting to you, the automotive side or the IoT in terms of revenue growth?\nObviously, the buckets are different sizes, but just breaking those two out as to what can drive some growth there. And then on Akash's side, if you look into Q4, you obviously have an extra week there, but you are seeing OpEx step down. Could you just walk through the moving parts that are expected to be up a little bit just given the extra week? Thanks for all that. Appreciate it, guys.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Tom. Actually, I appreciate the question. I really like the question. It gives me an opportunity to explain this. You should think of Qualcomm or not. We're not just trying to build one big business of differentiation. Actually, we're building a number of business, I'm sorry, of diversification. We're really focused on this. And when we talk about Auto Investor Day, that was in September 2022, we kind of outlined how that is going to be turning into a big platform for Qualcomm and building into the financials. And hopefully, you can see now, especially with this quarter, how that's materializing. And that will continue. That's not going away. We expect, given the size of our pipeline, we talk about $4 billion in 2026. We talk about $9 billion towards the end of the decade. We're on track to do that. But the second one is PCs.\nAs we get, it's early. As I said, we're very happy. It's exceeding our expectations. Some models sold out. We just launched. I think when we get to the Investor Day, we probably will feel comfortable putting a metric out there of what that's going to represent and how that's going to grow over time when we think about the total contribution to Qualcomm. That's one they're very excited about. We don't stop there. The next one, and I encourage you all to see what we're going to do next quarter. I think AI and computing, it's driving the industrial roadmap towards Qualcomm. We're completely redesigning our industrial roadmap, and we're going to unveil that roadmap in the coming months. We think about this as there are many markets that can benefit from technology.\nWe're super focused on growth and diversification, and it's about a number of bets, not just one bet. Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO and COO, Qualcoom\n\nAnd Tom, on your second question in OpEx, we had some non-labor material-related spend and tape-out-related spend in the third quarter, which is why third quarter OpEx was higher, and it goes down into the fourth quarter despite the extra week. And so it's just timing of non-labor spend that drove it. But fundamentally, no change in kind of the way we are managing OpEx. We're very committed to operating discipline and hiring. Even when we do it, it is very focused on specific new skills that are required for diversification. So you won't see a difference in the way we are managing the OpEx for the company.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nNo, I just want to just quickly thank all of our partners, our suppliers, our employees for a great job on the PC execution. I think we're very proud of what we accomplished. We'll continue to drive AI across each one of our businesses. We feel we have a very unique position in the ability to run AI at the edge. We're very happy with the automotive traction, and we're actually looking forward to the next generation of products launching in the coming months. As I said, hopefully creating a new vector for growth of the company in the future in industrial IoT. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Cristiano Amon.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q2, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $9.4 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.44 was above the high end of our guidance. Revenues from our chipset business of $8 billion reflect strong premium tier demand for Android smartphones and continued momentum in automotive. Licensing business revenues were $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our leading technology and product roadmaps, as well as executing on our growth and diversification opportunities. Let me share some key highlights from the business. As we drive intelligent computing everywhere, we're enabling the ecosystem to develop and commercialize on-device GenAI applications across smartphones, next-generation PCs, XR devices, vehicles, industrial edge, robotics, networking, and more. To that end, we recently launched the Qualcomm AI Hub, a gateway for developers to enable at-scale commercialization of on-device AI applications.\nIt features a library of approximately 100 pre-optimized AI models for devices powered by Snapdragon and Qualcomm platforms, delivering four times faster inferencing versus non-optimized models. As AI expands rapidly from the cloud to devices, we are extremely well-positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity, given our leadership position at the edge across technologies, including on-device AI. In automotive, the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is the industry's leading technology solution, and we're pleased to announce that our design win pipeline has increased to approximately $45 billion. We're growing faster than the addressable market and remain on track to achieve more than $4 billion of automotive revenues in fiscal 2026. In premium and high-tier smartphones, our Snapdragon mobile platforms continue to set the bar for performance and on-device GenAI capabilities. Recently launched flagship Android devices powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 are seeing strong demand globally, especially in China.\nWe are extending the most sought-after 8-series capabilities, including on-device AI, to a broader range of flagship and high-tier smartphones with the new Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 and Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 mobile platforms launching in the second half of 2024. In cellular modems, we have again established a new industry benchmark with the Snapdragon X80, the world's most advanced 5G modem RF system. The X80 supports 5G Advanced, the next era of 5G, in addition to direct-to-mobile, 3GPP-compliant satellite communications and leading release 18 features. Additionally, our networking solutions continue to gain traction as the Wi-Fi 7 transition expands to the enterprise. We are excited about the upcoming launches of next-generation Windows AI PCs powered by Snapdragon. The Snapdragon X Elite is the leader in performance, on-device AI, and power efficiency for the Windows ecosystem, and is optimally positioned to lead the transition to true AI PCs.\nI'm also pleased to share that we recently expanded our compute portfolio with the Snapdragon X Plus platform, which is designed to address a broader range of device tiers. In XR, we're seeing good momentum in augmented and virtual reality. In particular, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses powered by our Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 platform continue to gain traction with consumers. Additionally, the Meta Horizon OS running on Snapdragon is now open and available to third-party hardware makers. This is a significant milestone as it will expand the device ecosystem. Finally, at the Embedded World Conference in Germany, we announced two new solutions for the industrial IoT ecosystem: the Qualcomm QCC730 MicroPower Wi-Fi SoC and the Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2 platform. The QCC730 is specifically designed for IoT connectivity in battery-powered industrial, commercial, and consumer applications, featuring 88% lower power consumption than previous generations.\nThe RB3 Gen 2 platform is a complete hardware and software solution designed for a wide range of products, including various types of robots, drones, industrial handheld devices, and more. The RB3 is supported by the recently announced AI Hub and also features support for Qualcomm Linux, a comprehensive package of operating system, software, and developer tools for our IoT platforms. In summary, we're very pleased with the continued progress on our growth and diversification strategy. Beyond handsets, we have established leadership positions across automotive, XR, and networking, and we are well-positioned to do the same in PCs, industrial, and edge AI. We're optimistic about the opportunities ahead for the company and will continue to execute on our plan to deliver long-term growth and value for shareholders. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our Q2 fiscal earnings. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong non-GAAP results with revenues of $9.4 billion and EPS of $2.44, which was above the high end of our guidance range. QTL revenues of $1.3 billion and EBITDA margin of 71% were in line with our expectations. QCT delivered revenues of $8 billion and EBITDA margin of 29%, which was at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting strength across handset and automotive. QCT handset revenues of $6.2 billion included the benefit of flagship Android smartphone launches powered by our Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform. QCT IoT revenues increased 9% sequentially to $1.2 billion, which was slightly better than our expectations.\nWe had another record quarter in QCT automotive, with revenues increasing by 35% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting increased content in new vehicle launches with our Snapdragon Digital Chassis products. We returned $1.6 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including $731 million in stock repurchases and $895 million in dividends. During the quarter, we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividends from $0.80 to 0.85 per share, consistent with our commitment to dividend growth. Lastly, the sale of the restraint control system business successfully completes the divestitures of the non-Arriver businesses related to our acquisition of Veoneer. We are very pleased with this acquisition, and the Arriver team is executing on the development of our computer vision and drive policy ADAS software stack, targeting vehicle launches starting in late 2025. Now turning to guidance, our forecast for global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units remains unchanged for calendar 2024.\nWe estimate that global handset units will be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. This includes expected growth of high single-digit to low double-digit percentage in 5G handsets. For Q3 fiscal, we're forecasting revenues of $8.8 to 9.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.15 to 2.35. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.2 to 1.4 billion and EBITDA margins of 69% to 73%, reflecting normal seasonality for handset units. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.5 to 8.1 billion and EBITDA margins of 25% to 27%. Consistent with our previous comments, we anticipate QCT handset revenues to decline by mid-single-digit percentage sequentially, reflecting a seasonal trend due to the absence of flagship handset launches in the quarter. We expect QCT IoT revenues to grow sequentially by low to mid-single-digit percentage as we continue to see a gradual recovery from the macro factors impacting the industry.\nFollowing our record performance in the fiscal Q2, we expect QCT automotive revenues to grow by low double-digit percentage quarter over quarter as the increase in our design win pipeline continues to materialize into revenue. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.2 billion. In closing, we are pleased with our execution and financial performance for the first half of the fiscal year. Specifically, we saw year-over-year handset revenues from our Chinese OEM increase by greater than 40% in the first half of fiscal 2024, reflecting our strong competitive positioning and recovery of demand. Looking forward, our technology leadership positions us to continue to execute on our diversification strategy across IoT and automotive. In IoT, we look forward to normalization in demand across our customer base exiting fiscal 2024.\nIn addition, we're excited about the launch of our next-generation AI PCs powered by our Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus platforms from all leading PC OEMs starting in mid-2024. These PCs will deliver industry-leading processor performance, advanced on-device GenAI features, and extended battery life. In automotive, we are pleased that our design win pipeline has increased from $30 billion in September 2022 to approximately $45 billion, providing confidence in executing our long-term revenue targets. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nTo queue a question, press star, then the number one. To withdraw your question, press star two. If you're using a speakerphone, please wake up your handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nCorporate Vice President of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Cristiano, I wanted to ask you a question about sort of handset modem and RF architecture as we move into sort of the era of AI in handsets and mobile devices, where I think it's likely that the compute system and the memory system of the phone take up more battery life potentially as we try to compute some of these applications for AI inference on the device. I wonder how that changes your potential opportunity for your modem business integrated with your RF business. One of your competitors talked about a socket loss last night, and I think it went to you guys. I wonder if you might comment on how or why, but I think it's a bigger picture question. The compute subsystem of the phone puts pressure on the modem and RF.\nDoes that give you opportunities for further integration? Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nHello, Matt. Thanks for the question. Well, let me unpack this. I think as far as modem RF, we believe we have a very competitive RF portfolio, and we have been really delivering unique features across the modem and RF ecosystem, especially on power. As a general comment, not related to AI, but a general comment, I think as you look at AI running on devices and AI running on the cloud, modem becomes more important, especially things like latency of response, or hybrid AI models, have a new importance of real-time connectivity. So we're starting to see more and more the modem becoming more important.\nThe real advantage for Qualcomm is not only on the modem RF, even though I think we're very proud of having the leadership position there, is the fact that we actually created the ability to run AI pervasive on devices without compromising battery life. And that has been reflected within our NPU performance, both on phones as well as PCs and cars. And I think that's the key, I think, technology leadership position for AI, which is the best possible performance per watt. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Thanks for the question. Maybe if I can start with Cristiano asking, sort of you've mentioned the strong performance you're seeing in the China market, but maybe any more details in terms of just what you're seeing in the market relative to any specific numbers that you can share? Because there's been a lot of conflicting data points about the market being strong in one Q and then maybe taking a breather. So curious to understand what you're seeing on the ground there in terms of the China market. Also, it's always been sort of a leader in adopting new technology and seems like the AI phones are doing well. So how much of the recent trend do you attribute to an AI-led upgrade cycle versus a normal market rebound? And I have a quick follow-up after that. Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Samik. So what moves the market for us is premium and high tier. And I think what we're seeing in the China market is that the mix is improving. As the market has stabilized, when it returns to some form of normality, what we really liked is that within that market, premium and high tier as a percentage continue to increase, and that's actually what's driving the results. And we are seeing the very first instances of on-device AI and GenAI being launched in premium devices, and that has been resonating well with the consumers. So it's a positive trend that we like. The other color I'd like to add is we have not seen signs of weakness in the Android premium market in China, especially with our OEMs. So a lot of the strength is really coming from premium devices from Xiaomi, Honor, Oppo, OnePlus, and Vivo.\nI think Huawei entering that market actually increased the overall TAM of premium Android.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nOkay. Maybe Samik, to add a couple of quick data points on top. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, H1 2024, our revenue from Chinese OEMs grew by greater than 40% year-over-year, and that is also reflected in our Q3 guidance. So it's a trend that's holding up as we look forward. And then from a roadmap perspective, as you look into our new premium tier launches coming up later this year, in addition to GenAI, we'll have our Oryon custom CPU cores coming in as well. So we're very excited about the roadmap.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nGot it. And for my follow-up, maybe, Akash, this is more for you. I mean, when you talked about the seasonality into the June quarter, handset seasonality is sort of the typical seasonality that you see, and the aggregate results or revenue being better than seasonal is really being driven by autos here with the low double-digit growth that you talked about. Clearly, very strong sort of pipeline of wins, but how sustainable is this sort of pace of improvement quarter over quarter in terms of revenue? Just want to get a sense if this is when we start to see more sort of inflection in auto revenues given the strong pipeline you have, and that drives better seasonal results going forward even into the September quarter. Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. From an automotive perspective, as you know, we've given out a target of greater than $4 billion revenue in fiscal 2026. What you're seeing is really our design win pipeline materializing into revenue on our way to that number. That's the framework as to how I'd think about it. Two key kind of data points on our design win pipeline. As you'll recall, the last number we had given was $30 billion in September, about 18 months ago, September 2022. The updated number that we just provided is $45 billion of design wins. Obviously, a very significant increase. Of note, within that, approximately 1/3 is driven by ADAS. We're seeing a tremendous success now in ADAS, and that's adding to our design win pipeline.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMike Walkley\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Group, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat. Thanks. And maybe just building off the 40% increase in shipments to the Chinese OEMs holding through the June quarter guidance, just based on your expanding on-device AI portfolio, is this level of demand sustainable into the back half of the calendar year? Or asked another way, do you expect the smartphone market to have kind of normal seasonal trends after the June quarter dip?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So as you'll recall, Mike, we had said earlier that we expect Q3 to be the low quarter from a financial perspective, just given the seasonality of our business. That still holds true. So as we go from Q3 to Q4 and then into fiscal Q1, which is the December quarter, we expect growth as new launches of phones happen across all major OEMs. And as I said earlier, we're going to have the launch of our Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip as well, and we're extremely excited about what that chip does and the launches that will come through that chip later in the year. Specifically, as you think about Q4, we expect the EPS growth from Q3 to Q4 to be consistent with fiscal 2023, and then we'll grow beyond that into the December quarter.\n\nMike Walkley\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Group, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat. That's very helpful. Maybe just for a quick follow-up on the IoT business, it sounds like March is the bottom as you laid out. Can you maybe update us on the three segments, just what you're seeing in terms of the inventory correction?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So Mike, we had talked about December fiscal Q1 as the bottom quarter. We grew from that into March by 9% sequential growth, which was better than our expectations. And then now we're guiding low to mid single-digit growth into the September quarter. So as we'd outlined at the beginning of the year, we would see improvement through the year, and that trend is holding, and we expect it to hold in the fiscal Q4 as well. In terms of different parts within IoT, consumer is more aligned with phones, so we've seen that recover faster. And then the industrial networking is consistent with what our peers are seeing within those industries, and the recovery timeline is aligned with that. If you kind of step back and think about our business there, we're pretty excited about new products that are coming out.\nSo Cristiano talked about the PC set of products coming out later this year, device launch coming out later this year. But then in addition to that, we also have new products in industrial and Wi-Fi 7 that will drive growth into this IoT segment as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your questions.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, just on the PC outlook, it does sound like devices are going to be available for purchase in the back half. So how much PC is actually in the Q3 outlook, and what should we expect for the PC in the numbers into the second half and beyond? When does PC actually get big enough for us to see it?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nHey, Stacy, thanks for the question. We have a lot of product momentum right now, and especially with all the launches. I would encourage everybody to go watch the Microsoft Build event, especially what is happening with on-device AI. There's a lot of product momentum and launches. As those devices start to ramp up in volume, and since a lot of them are going to be back to school, it's going to be more of a fiscal 2025 event in terms of being material within the IoT segment. Anything you'd like to add, Akash?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nJust maybe in our June quarter guidance, there isn't material PC volume forecasted in our numbers.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. One thing we're going to do, sorry, just real quick. One thing we're going to do, like we provide an update on auto this quarter, we're going to provide a more detailed update next quarter on PC, especially as we're going to have those devices out launched.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGot it. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about Huawei revenue. So in the queue, it says that you're not expecting any further product revenue from Huawei beyond the end of the calendar year. So I know it's only low-end 4G that's left, but how big is that now in the numbers, and how much of that will be going away at the end of the calendar year?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So Stacy, if you look at Huawei, as you've seen, they have launched multiple tiers of 5G devices already with their own chips, and clearly, we don't participate in those devices. What we're shipping at this point is, the license that we have is for 4G chips, and as you rightly pointed out, it's at the low end of the spectrum. What we outlined in the queue is, since the devices will eventually transition all to 5G, we don't expect any revenue from Huawei product business in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, thank you. Good afternoon. The question is on QTL, and it sounds like that you're starting to see some degree of improvement, particularly among the China OEMs in the QCT business, but that thus far hasn't translated to the QTL business. Can you talk about sort of the lag between the recovery in those segments and what your level of optimism or not is for sort of breaking out of this range in the QTL business?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So as you know well, QTL business is really driven by the size of the market, and there is a cap on the total ASPs up to which the percent royalty rate applies. So as we've seen, the benefit on the QCT side is a lot driven by more units at the premium tier, especially above $400 in price. It's not something that benefits the QTL business directly the way the royalty program is structured. So that's the disconnect between the two.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. That's helpful. As a follow-up, with regard to the AI handsets, a lot of the questions that we receive on this is sort of why and what are the applications, what are the reasons for a consumer to upgrade their handsets to AI? Cristiano, you talked about the developer hub that you're running. Perhaps that gives you some insight into what the developers are doing, what's going on in the pipeline that will drive these AI handset sales?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, it's a great question. I want to step back and say, in general, I think AI is going to benefit all the devices. I think AI, when it extends to running on-device, besides the benefit of working alongside the cloud, it has completely new use cases: privacy, security, latency, costs, personalization, etc. Here's how you should look into this. In the same way that when the smartphone started, you have a handful of apps that eventually grew to thousands and hundreds of thousands of apps, and that was really the user experience. I think we're in the very early stage, and you're starting to see some of those use cases, and you have exactly that moment. Some of the phones have 10 apps, and they're growing.\nOne of the reasons we have the AI hub is because this is a new, I think, moment for the industry. It works a little bit different. It's different than how you think about the traditional app store. You have many models, many in the open-source models. They can run on the device, and they can be attached or built into any application. So I think what's starting to see is a lot of developer interest. As we said in the prepared remarks, we have over 100 different models, from models from OpenAI to Llama 3, and many. They're quantized and optimized to the NPU. When they are optimized using the tool, they run four times faster than the model without optimization. And those models and those use cases started to be implemented in apps, whether it's an image or associated with a camera, it's associated with language.\nSo we're at the beginning of that transition. We really like what we see because it's really creating reason for people to buy a new device. It's going to be the same on PC. It's going to be the same as they come to cars as well and industrial. So it's an exciting tailwind, I think, for our strategy of actually driving computing and connectivity at the edge.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. I wanted to ask about the mix of the business. And as you said, Akash, China is holding up quite well. It's up 40% year over year in the fiscal first half. But it's within shouting distance of kind of where it peaked on a quarterly basis back in fiscal 2022 when they were obviously overbuilding at that time. So can you talk a little bit about what's happening there? How much of the year-over-year growth is units versus pricing?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. Thanks, team. As we said earlier, it's really the biggest benefit we are seeing is the mix being stronger. As you know, our competitive positioning is stronger at the higher tiers, and so that's helping us. The second is when you look at generation over generation, the chips, especially at the premium tier, are getting more capable as more, not just Gen AI, but other additional capabilities, are being integrated into the chips, and there's strong competition between the OEMs. So there's demand for those capabilities. So we're seeing that come through as well. And it's really a combination of those things that is driving strength versus a unit upside. The unit side we are seeing is very much aligned with the market forecast, which says flat market versus last year.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nI got it. Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, how sustainable are these RF wins that you've obviously gotten for this upcoming phone? Should we consider that as kind of part of the modem? So when the modem goes away, the RF wins also go away?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nSo of course, we'll not talk about any specific customer here, but I think I'd go back to the very first question that Cristiano answered. The key thing for us is the modem RF architecture and how, when we develop the end-to-end together, it creates an advantage for us in terms of performance, in terms of time to market for our customers as well. And that's a sustainable advantage that will stay going forward for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Group, Bank of America\n\nHi guys. When I look at your numbers, you beat the numbers mainly on handsets. It's both for QTL and QCT, of course. I'm trying to understand how much of the outperformance is just China versus the rest of the world. When you look at the rest of the world, what were the trends when it comes to your QCT shipments and QTL? Then within China, where are we in the recovery cycle? Right? There is ongoing growth, but what we're seeing now in the first half of the year is mainly recovery from last year. Are you now at normal levels, and from here, it should trend normally based on demand, or are we still recovering from the low of last year? Thanks.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So a couple of comments. First is on the overall picture across OEMs. So China saw a very significant benefit, but we had strength across other parts of the Android ecosystem as well. And so it's not something that was isolated to one or two OEMs. It was a broad trend that is just representative of the overall market and the mixture that we discussed in the overall market. On your second question, as we think about our strength in handsets, we are very optimistic that as we go forward, this is a trend that holds forward. This is not about inventory. As I said earlier, the units are actually aligned with the size of the market, and the trends are really driven by mix and increased content.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Group, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Okay. Second question, just on the AI, I don't know if it's possible to quantify at all, but if you look at the non-AI QCT contribution versus an AI QCT contribution, when AI is included in the mix, is there a number where it comes to the increase in content per phone? Does it mean that the semiconductor there is going to be more expensive, higher price for you? So even if the market doesn't grow, can you grow just by the market shifting to AI? That's theoretical, but I'm trying to isolate the impact of AI. Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nA lot of people are tall, but let me try to give you maybe an answer that helps explain this. In first step, a lot of the increased content and ASP on QCT chipsets, including premium, has been driven by the compute part, and it's more performance on the compute, CPU, GPU, and the NPU. Second, the NPU has been the largest area of silicon growth in those chips. So generation over generation, one of the largest improvements has been the NPU for AI, and AI is driving a lot of silicon content in those devices because they expected computational capability to run those models. The benefit financially, I think it's going to come probably in the way that you're starting to see the beginning of it right now, which improves the mix.\nUsers want to buy a more capable phone that can run AI, so it drives the market towards a richer mix of higher improvement tier, share gains, and then an upgrade cycle as people want to buy a new phone. That's how we should think about it in phones. PC is a little different. As we enter the PC, I think the AI and the ability to run on-device AI better than any of our peers on a laptop, I think it's going to be a tailwind to the capability. Car, it builds more value on top of the platforms that are being commercialized and designed with the increase of the pipeline, especially in many of those platforms, we can do a softer upgrade to be able to run Gen AI on those vehicles. So I think that's how this is going to materialize for Qualcomm.\nThe last part of my answer is industrial, which is a new area that we're trying to upgrade to higher performance from microcontrollers to higher performance computing connectivity. I think Edge AI is proving to be a key attribute of this market going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I was hoping you could speak to QCT gross margins. They impressively held flat despite revenues down 5%. I guess the real question here is not just how you did it this quarter, but how should we be thinking about, as you bring on non-handset revenues to the model, what incremental gross margins might look like for QCT, particularly as we think about the AI PC and IoT as well as auto, given that growing backlog?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. Thanks, CJ. Yeah. I think the first couple of quarters of this fiscal year, we've definitely seen strength in margin, and it's driven by the richer mix that we've discussed on the call. What we're guiding for Q3 is a sequential decline, again, reflecting kind of lack of flagship launches in the quarter. No change to what we've said on gross margins before. We've given a range, and we've been operating at the high end of the range, but no kind of fundamentally change on the framework of it going forward.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nGreat. As a quick follow-up, on the auto side, you talked about the higher backlog, reiterated the $4 billion plus. Should we be thinking about kind of amortizing that 26+% growth equally into fiscal 2025, 2026, or might that come in sooner with faster growth into 2025?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So I mean, obviously, we're not kind of guiding quarters that far out at this point, but if you kind of take the current run rate and extend it forward towards the $4 billion target, kind of generally a slope growth increase between the two data points is a reasonable way of thinking about it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before joining the call?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYes. Just a few comments. I think we're incredibly pleased with our technology and product roadmap evolution, and we're really looking forward to our next-generation PCs with Snapdragon. As I said during the call, I encourage everyone to look at the announcements from Microsoft at Build and how that's going to drive much more AI into the Qualcomm platform. I was just going to leave you all with a thought. One great thing about the execution of the company: every time we enter a new market or we set ourselves to go do a new market, and we end up building a very strong position. We went from mobile to our front end. We became number one. Same thing when we went to Wi-Fi. Automotive, it was something that we had ambition to build as part of the diversification. I think we're quickly becoming the industry partner of choice.\nWe believe that there's a long-term opportunity with virtual reality, augmented reality, and now we have the absolute majority of the designs. With PC, we clearly build the leading platform, and we have the product momentum that we hopefully will translate into finance in the coming years. I just wanted to state that we feel good about the company technology capabilities and how we're driving growth and diversification for shareholders. Thank you very much for the support. Thank you to all our employees, and I'm looking forward to talking to you in the next call.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q1, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $9.9 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75, above the high end of our guidance. Revenues from our chipset business of $8.4 billion reflect healthy Android demand and continue strong momentum. In automotive licensing business, revenues were $1.5 billion. We're pleased with these results, and I will now share some key highlights from the business. In handsets, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile Platform is setting a new standard for on-device Gen AI experiences for premium smartphones and powers all true flagship Android devices launched and launching this fiscal year. Notably, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile Platform for Galaxy is featured in the recently announced Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra globally.\nIn addition to the Galaxy S24 and S24+ in multiple regions, the Galaxy S24 series includes on-device AI features such as Live Translate, Interpreter, Chat Assist, Nightography, and more. This marks the beginning of how Gen AI will evolve the overall smartphone experience and highlights the significant opportunity for Snapdragon platforms. We're also announcing that we extended a multi-year agreement with Samsung relating to Snapdragon platforms for flagship Galaxy smartphone launches starting in 2024. The extended agreement demonstrates the value of Snapdragon 8, our technology leadership, and our successful long-term strategic partnership with Samsung in the quarter. We also announced the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 Mobile Platform which brings leading Gen AI capabilities to high-tier Android smartphones and is a category leader in both experiences and performance.\nIn our QTL business. We're pleased to share that we recently extended several key license agreements. First, Apple exercised its unilateral option to extend its global patent license agreement for an additional two years, taking the existing agreement through to March 2027. Second, we have renewed long-term agreements with two significant Chinese smartphone OEMs. In addition, we continue to negotiate new agreements or renewals with other key licensees and OEMs, including some whose current agreements are set to expire in early fiscal 2025. Automotive continues to be an important pillar of our growth and diversification strategy. Notably, 75 new models launched commercially in 2023 with our technologies, highlighting Qualcomm's growing scale in automotive and execution of our design wins. Earlier this month, at CES, we announced our collaboration with Bosch to have our Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC power their new central vehicle computer.\nAs a reminder, Snapdragon Ride Flex enables the fusion of infotainment and ADAS functionalities on a single SoC, enabling automakers to realize a unified central compute and software-defined vehicle architecture that scales across tiers.\nAdditionally, we demonstrated digital cockpits, connected services, and advanced driver assistance enabled by Gen AI models running locally on the Snapdragon platform. This new capabilities can be enabled on a number of existing designs via a software upgrade. This represents significant new opportunities for Qualcomm and our partners in PCs. We're driving towards the launch of Snapdragon X Elite in mid-2024 and are pleased that our design win traction continues to increase since the platform was announced last October. We expect Snapdragon X Elite to set the industry benchmark for on-device Gen AI and Copilot experiences. In addition to leading performance and battery life for next-generation Windows PCs, we recently expanded our mixed reality solutions with the announcement of the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2.\nOur new platform supports 4.3K per eye resolution and 90 frames per second and 12 or more concurrent cameras to deliver crisp, immersive, mixed reality, and virtual reality experiences. We are proud to partner with Samsung and Google to provide leading XR experiences to Galaxy users. By utilizing Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 in Edge Networking, we announced the Snapdragon X35 5G Modem-RF System, the world's first commercial Release 17 5G RedCap Solution. The Snapdragon X35 brings a new class of purpose-built 5G for Internet of Things devices. Devices powered by Snapdragon X35 are expected to launch by H1 2020.\nWe continue to believe that industrial edge devices with connectivity, high performance computing, and on-device AI will become one of our largest addressable opportunities fueled by the secular trends of digital transformation. As such, we're accelerating our investments in solutions, ecosystem, and broad channel enablement to position ourselves for growth while we navigate the industry-wide inventory drawdown. One key area of focus is to enable our customers to unlock the potential of Gen AI at the enterprise using our chipset solutions. As an example, Zebra Technologies and Toshiba recently demonstrated on-device Gen AI capabilities for enterprise workflows and inventory management at retail self-checkout, respectively. Additionally, Honeywell showcased a Qualcomm-powered Edge AI box for warehouse applications. As we complete Q1 of fiscal 2024 ahead of our expectations, I'm very optimistic about Qualcomm's trajectory and the opportunities ahead.\nThe fundamentals of our growth drivers remain unchanged, our diversification strategy is working, and we're making significant progress across mobile, automotive, computing, XR, edge networking, industrial IoT, and more. At the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we will provide an update on our cellular modem and connectivity leadership as well as on our overall scale of Snapdragon Gen AI. I would now like to turn the call over to.\nAkash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our first fiscal quarter earnings. We are pleased to announce strong non-GAAP results above the high end of guidance with revenues of $9.9 billion and EPS of $2.75. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion, an EBT margin of 74%, were at the high end of guidance, reflecting slightly higher handset units. QCT delivered revenues of $8.4 billion and EBITDA margin of 31%, both above the high end of guidance. Reflecting strength in handsets and automotive revenues, QCT EBT margin includes the benefit of revenue scale, stronger product mix, and operating discipline. Handset revenues of $6.7 billion were higher than our prior expectations, primarily due to the increased demand driven by the acceleration of Android flagship launches with our Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile Platform.\nNotably, our Android handset revenues from Chinese OEMs exceeded our expectations of greater than 35% sequential growth. IoT revenues of $1.1 billion reflect the industry-wide challenges we previously outlined.\nWe achieved record Automotive revenues of $598 million, which grew by 12% sequentially, reflecting the increased content in new vehicle launches with our Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% sequentially to $2.1 billion and included the benefit of accelerated implementation of cost actions that we had previously outlined for H1 2024.\nLastly, we returned $1.7 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including $784 million in stock repurchases and $895 million in dividends. Before turning to second fiscal quarter guidance, I'll update you on global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units. We estimate that global units declined by mid single digit percentage in calendar 2023 relative to calendar 2022, an improvement from our prior expectations. Due to the recent stabilization in demand for calendar 2024, we estimate that global handset units will be flat to slightly up on a year over year basis. This estimate includes expected growth of high single digit to low double digit percentage in 5G handsets. Turning to guidance for the second fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $8.9 to 9.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.2 to 2.4.\nThe sequential decline in revenues and non-GAAP EPS relative to the first fiscal quarter will be driven by seasonality for a modem only handset customer in both QTL and QCT. In QTL we estimate revenues of $1.2 to 1.4 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.6 to 8.2 billion and EBIT margins of 27% to 29%. For QCT handset revenues coming off strong performance in the first fiscal quarter, we anticipate Android revenues will be approximately flat quarter-over-quarter on a sequential basis. We expect QCT IoT revenues to grow by mid- to high-single-digit percentage with QCT automotive revenues slightly down consistent with the trend in the prior year. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $2.2 billion. This reflects typical calendar year resets for certain employee related costs.\nIn closing, we are very pleased to start our fiscal year with strong execution and financial performance in QTL. As Cristiano outlined, we are pleased to have extended several key license agreements. We do not expect any material change in QTL licensing revenue run rate as a result of these extensions in QCT. Our technology differentiation will accelerate with our on-device Gen AI leadership and introduction of our custom Qualcomm Oryon CPU. We also remain well positioned to execute on our diversification strategy by extending our technology portfolio to deliver industry-leading products across automotive and IoT. This concludes our prepared.\nRemarks. Back to you, Mauricio. Thank you.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nKash Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nThank you. To cue a question, press star, then the number 1. To withdraw your question, press star, 2. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. The first question is from Samik Chatterjee, J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nQuestions. Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the results here. Maybe if I can start with AI and particularly the launch of the Samsung S24. Now you have some incremental sort of experience in terms of devices launching in the market and the performance and consumer reception you're seeing to that. So I know you outlined adoption of 3G, 4G, but any way of giving us some flavor of what you're thinking in terms of adoption of these AI devices or AI on edge in terms of the smartphone market? How similar or different will that curve look like relative to 5G adoption? And any insights from the sort of pipeline you're working on will be helpful for us. Thank you. And I have a follow up.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nHello Samik, thanks for the question. This is Cristiano. Look, it's early, but I think we're definitely excited about what we see in the beginning. It's not only unique to the Galaxy S24 that has a number of new use cases running Gen AI on the device. I mentioned a few of my prepared remarks like translation, and you have a much more effective assistant in a number of different applications. We're going to see productivity coming, but we also see that happening with some of our other customers from China launching a number of models. I think we have a large number now of models being ported into our hardware for Gen AI. I think we're starting to see the beginning of new use cases. Reviews have been positive, and we are happy with what we've seen, the results following the launch.\nI think we need to monitor the situation, but you know, eventually at a minimum is going to have a favorable impact on mix, which is a trend that we continue to see. Premium and high tier with more computing power is the fastest growing segments in the handset. Market.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah, got it. Maybe just as a follow up.\nThe Android OBX customers of the Chinese OEMs you work with. They exceeded your expectation in the fiscal Q1, but as you're looking to the Q1, you're guiding to a more flattish trajectory here. I know the industry sort of been looking at an inventory refill from those customers as well, driving some of the momentum. So just wondering if you can give us an update in terms of what you're seeing from those customers and if at all Huawei and their emergence in the market is starting to have an impact in terms of volume or market share for these customers as well in the context of your flat guide for them for quarter-over-quarter. Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nSure. Same. It's Akash. As we have said previously, as we entered fiscal 2024, our view was that Android channel inventory had largely normalized, and so as we go through the year, we typically see normal build-bleed cycle around handset launches. So that's kind of the phase we are in, from our perspective. In the Q1, what we saw was higher demand due to the acceleration of Android flagship launches with our new chip, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and we saw very strong demand across all the major Android OEMs, and so happy of course with that traction, and that momentum carries over to the Q2 as well, and that's what you're seeing both in our results and our guide going forward.\nIn terms of your comment on Huawei, really what we've seen since Huawei's 5G launch is that the premium tier TAM in China has expanded, and so we're continuing to see strong demand from our customers post that launch.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nStock Analyst, Cowen\n\nQuestion. Thank you very much, guys. Good afternoon. I guess for my first question, Cristiano, it's good to hear, I guess, the formal announcement of an extension with your partnership with Samsung. And you mentioned, I think, in your prepared script that it started with 2024 devices, but I assume it's longer than that. So maybe if you give us a little context as to the length and any details you can share on the new agreement. You guys obviously have your new custom CPUs coming into the Snapdragon roadmap and some expanded NPU product as well. So we see kind of what the split is, our share in the flagship at Samsung currently. But I'm just trying to understand a bit more about what this means going forward.\nBasis.Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThanks for the question, Matt.\nThe agreement that we announced at this earnings call, it is a multi-year agreement. We're not disclosing the duration, but there's several years into that agreement, and I think your observation is correct. I think that starts at 2024. I think you should look at the launch of Galaxy S24 as a good proxy on how you should think about the agreement between us and Samsung. But most important is the thing that you outline. Our roadmap's getting stronger over time, especially with our custom CPU coming to mobile, and we're aiming to have the leadership position in mobile on CPU and our NPU continue to expand. As I mentioned before, we're just at the beginning of the Gen AI transition. I think in summary we're very pleased with our relationship with Samsung, and it's a very long-term relationship with this customer.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nStock Analyst, Cowen\n\nGot it. No, thank you for that, I guess. My follow-up question is one for Akash. I mean, first of all, Akash, congratulations on the new COO hat.\nWell done. But my question is around margins, and I noticed that even with the IoT business down dramatically, there was some improvement in sequential gross margin in the quarter and back above 30% in QCT operating margin. So maybe you could discuss some of the moving parts with margins in the business because it was pleasantly a bit better than I had modeled, and I kind of want to see what might be sustainable or what actions you took on a go forward basis on both the growth and the operating side.\nThanks.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Matt, and thanks for your wishes. I'm looking forward in this new role to working with Cristiano and the executive team to kind of deliver on our long-term priorities. Of course, I'll continue to remain committed to my CFO role, working closely with the team here and maintaining consistency and transparency, and looking forward to see a lot of you at upcoming events. On the margin side, what you saw in Q1 is really the fact that our gross margins were stronger because the mix was richer. We had a higher set of premium tier launches coming through, and that impacted our volume, and we benefited from that mix richer mix. If you look at our Q1 guide, we are guiding largely in line with how our Q1 came in.\nSo that was obviously great to see from an operating margin perspective. It's in addition to the strength in the gross margins, obviously the revenue scale, and the actions we took on the OpEx also benefited, and so we were extremely happy to deliver 31% operating margin in QCT and really focused on delivering to the long-term target we've outlined to the investors.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMike Walkley\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on extending some of the licensing deals. I guess just want to jump a little bit into the IoT business. You know, the three segments I assume consumer is still weaker, but can you update us kind of how the inventory bleed is trending for the three businesses within IoT, and then you know, within that question too, just on the recovery of IoT, can you share with us the X Elite ramp and how material this might become for IoT say in the next one to two years?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nMaybe I'll address the first part, and then Cristiano can talk through the X Elite question from an IoT inventory perspective. What we have seen is stabilization really on the consumer side. As you know, we were one of the first to call out the weakness in IoT, and now we're seeing it go through both on the industrial and the edge networking side. Consistent with our previous comments, we think Q1 was the bottom for our IoT revenue stream. We're guiding Q1 up mid to high single digits, second half of the fiscal year. As we see the inventory channel kind of normalizing and end markets kind of benefiting from that. We're excited about what our product portfolio can bring, and overall lots of opportunities for us there.\nIn my mind there's significant uncertainty, but we are cautiously optimistic, and I think we have a great product portfolio as we look.\nForward.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, your question about X Elite in PC, you know, it's too early. We're tracking to the launch of products with this chipset tied with the next version of Microsoft Windows that has a lot of the Windows AI capabilities.\nWe're still maintaining the same date which is driven by Windows which is mid 2024 getting ready for back to school. What we're excited about it is since we announced that at Tech Summit showing the performance of the product and the AI capabilities, design traction continued to increase. So we had increased the number of designs since last quarter, and we continue to march forward towards the launch. We like that everybody's now talking about on-device AI on PC. That's where we started this journey with X Elite, and I think that proves to be a tailwind to the opportunity for us in.\nPCs.\n\nMike Walkley\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat, thanks. Maybe Cristiano, just a quick follow on question just on the auto business, how should we think about the ramp of that business over the next one to two years? You've talked about a lot of design and activity and digital chassis ramping this year, but with ADAS coming into the model, how might that business ramp towards your target in.\n2026?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nNo, absolutely. Thank you for your question. Look, let me step back a little bit and say we're extremely pleased with our performance in auto, especially when you look at the overall market right now and you look at Qualcomm results with record revenues and very strong, I think, year-over-year growth in 2023 and this year that just closed. We launched 75 models with our silicon with significant improvement in silicon content as relates to those immersive cockpits, and in many cases processing for safety. So we're very happy with the business, and I think the answer to your question is we're on track to meet our targets that we set on Auto Investor Day of $4 billion and 9 billion respectively, I think for 2026 and the end of the decade. So we're on track for that.\nThe next quarter we're going to give you an update on a design win pipeline that continues to grow.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please receive your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nResearch Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi guys, thanks for taking my questions. So given that you've got Android.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nAndroid was pretty strong in December and it's flat into March.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHow are you thinking about June seasonality given all these, these trends in moving?\nP/E's? I know it's usually down a.\nBut from March, but I guess in the current environment, are you thinking about June?\nSeasonality?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nStacy, it's Akash. No change to the shape of the year comments that we made last time. Following Q1, we do expect Q3 to be the lowest quarter. It's one of the quarters where we do not have any significant flagship launches, and as a result, you kind of see a decline in Q3, then growth back into Q4, and it's when you look at Q1 to Q3, we expect a trend consistent with the last two years. H1 obviously benefited from this acceleration of launches for Android, and pretty happy with that, and I think it sets us up as we look forward in terms of both content growth with our strong roadmap and just positioning overall. In the handset market.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you. For my follow-up, I.\nJust want to ask about Huawei. Was Huawei still completely out of?\nThe model in December, and is it out of the model in the March guide?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYes, as we've said in the past, Stacy, we do have a 4G license to ship to Huawei, and so we've continued to ship based on customer demand. But as you're aware, they have launched a 5G device with their own chip, and that's, I think, the priority going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, thank you. I guess just a question on QTL, and coming from your comments about the global handset market, it sounds like you're a little more optimistic on the 5G market on the year. QTL revenue has been kind of stuck in this range because of where handset units have been. I guess, what's the outlook for QTL going forward in the context of what you're expecting for the handset market overall?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, so as we outlined for a handset market, when you look at calendar 2024 overall market, we expect it to be flat to slightly up. But within that 5G obviously is our target market, especially for the chip business. We expect that to be high single-digit to low double-digit up on a year-over-year basis. Within QTL, we'll stick with the guidance we have given before. We think there's a scale to the business that's aligned with the handset market and the two will move in line. And then on the extensions of the license, I just wanted to make sure that I said this in my prepared remarks, but just to confirm, as a result of the extension, we do not expect any material change in our QCT licensing revenue run rate. So it's consistent with the program.\nIn the QTL licensing revenue run rate, it's consistent with the.\n\nChris Caso\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, that's helpful. Thank you. As a follow up, Cristiano, I wonder if you could speak to, you know, sort of the decision to, you know, to re-engage in custom cores with Oryon and you know, what outcome you expect of that. I mean it sounds like, you know, that's been, you know, one of the reasons or one of the things behind the renewal of the Samsung agreement, you know, what sort of change in the market because Qualcomm did custom cores in the past and you know, what do you expect to get out of that in terms of market share and content and such?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Chris, for a question. Look, it's consistent, I think, with the strategy we outlined, I think, following the acquisition of Nuvia in the past. Qualcomm has been designing now its own custom cores, and I think the first instantiation of that was for PCs. Actually, if you remember in the past, that was the key motivation as we embark on this journey to create a leading SoC for laptops for the Windows ecosystem. We needed to have the performance leadership, and we needed to design our own CPU to deliver the results that we did with X Elite. Now we're taking that across the entire roadmap. Your observation is correct. As we take that into mobile next.\nWe're seeing significant interest from our partners as this truly becomes a leadership position in the marketplace now across all cores, not only graphics and AI, but also CPU. We're not stopping there; following smartphone, that's going to go into our automotive business. We're excited about what the team has accomplished today. Oryon is really well positioned to be the leading CPU core in the industry.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please receive your.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Can you talk about restocking in China? It looks like the China Android.\nObviously was up a ton and it's being guided flat. Your peer was a bit cautious on this. Can you talk? Do you think you're shipping now to consumption and do you think you're going to ship to consumption through the rest of the year? And then I had another question?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Tim, consistent with what I said earlier in the call, I think we're kind of largely at normalized inventory for Android entering the fiscal year. What you saw in the December quarter, at least for us to a large extent, was a build for the various premium tier launches that happened during the period. And so we do expect normal build bleed cycles through the year as devices launch, but that's kind of the framework with which we are operating going forward.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGot it. Now that you have the modem for longer for this one flagship customer, one could envision a scenario where maybe you can leverage that into some new RF content that you have not had in the past. Is this a scenario? I mean, it seems like it could add $1 billion, maybe. I mean, you were sort of running to $4 billion a year in your RFFE business prior to stopping to tell us what that is. So it seems like that is something you could potentially leverage, the reliance on your modem business.? Thanks.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Tim, I'd say that's a conversation, obviously, that we will talk to the customer about. It's a part of our portfolio and we'll make it available if they're interested.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank Please proceed with your.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nQuestion. Hi, guys, thanks for asking a couple.\nQuestions. Akash, congrats on the COO role. The first one is on the OpEx side of things. You guys did a great job in the calendar Q4, and you gave the guidance for the fiscal first or fiscal Q2. How should we think about that for the remainder of the year, given your commentary on kind of doubling down on some of the opportunities, opportunistic investments to diversify the company, new cores etc.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. Ross, thank you very much.\nFrom an OpEx perspective, really the way we think about it is any hiring that we do will be very selective and focused on really acquiring new skills that are required for diversification. But other than that, we've gone through a reduction recently. We think we're at scale to a large extent and we're committed to operating discipline.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. I guess for my follow-up, I noticed in the 10-Q you had a new 10% customer. I think it was a 14% customer. I don't expect you to name who that is, but is that a reflection of this strong China demand that you talked about in the continuation of good future growth opportunities or was there any one-time aspect of that customer, whoever it may be, popping up in the quarter?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nI think the way you framed it in your first theory is a reasonable way of thinking about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please receive your.\n\nTom O' Malley\n\nDirector Equity Research, Barclays\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question and just passing on my congratulations to Akash as well. I just wanted to ask, on the ASP side for Android, you're obviously kind of characterizing a market that's flattish into March, kind of the bottom in June and then improving from there. But you've benefited from some good mix in the beginning of the fiscal year here. Could you talk about what you would expect from a mix perspective as you go to the back half? Would you see the same kind of strength on the ASP side that you've kind of seen over the past year? That'd be really helpful to understand. Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So if you think about Premium Flag, premium flagship launches for our OEMs, a lot of the launches happen in the holiday timeframe, just before the holidays, going into Chinese New Year as well. And so you've seen a lot of those happen. We do have some significant launches through the middle of the year, but obviously the next big launch goes into the holiday season, starting with Apple and then going into the Android launches. So that's the typical cadence. Now just to confirm, that's just the premium tier we are talking about. Of course there are other tiers, including the high tier where we have very significant presence and that does drive a significant portion of our launches that happen through the year and also our revenue base.\n\nTom O' Malley\n\nDirector Equity Research, Barclays\n\nHelpful. And then just on the auto business, you've clearly seen some weaker data points just out of the ecosystem. Can you explain why your auto business may not be levered to some of like the ADAS areas where you've seen the particular weakness of late? And like when do those ADAS and you know, wins start layering on? Is that more of like a 2025 story for you guys or 2026? Just can you talk about the pipeline and when you see those you know, more advanced wins kind of layering into the revenue stream? Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nHi, this is Cristiano. Look, the automotive story of Qualcomm is primarily driven by share gains as models with our silicon, part of our pipeline, started to materialize into revenue. And the way you should think about it, historically a lot of the revenue was telematics. Now you see the largest component being a lot of the fully immersive digital cockpits on the car. And we already have some revenue from ADAS processing. You see a lot of cars, for example, in China with both ADAS and autonomy with our processor. You see some of our customers in the United States with our processor, and I think that continues to grow as we get towards our 2026 revenue target. You're probably going to see very healthy components of all of those elements.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please receive your question.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nI have two follow-ups on answers or questions you got before. The first one is Samsung. On one hand, there is a new contract. On the other hand, Samsung is going to use their own?\nMore in 2024 versus 2023. So, net net. Are you expecting revenues of Samsung to go up or down in 2024 versus 2023? What are your expectations of share losses with this?\nCan you frame it for us? And the second question is on the auto business. You had a phenomenal quarter. It's very different from the other auto companies. Most other auto companies had weakness. What is the strength related to, meaning? Is it share gain with certain customers? Is it new product, or can you just put some color on the strength or relative strength versus the other?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, Qualcomm\n\nThanks. Yeah, Tal, it's Akash. So on Samsung, and this is conversation about the premium tier. I assume in GS23 we did have global share. In the GS24 that just launched, and consistent with what we said on the last quarter, we expect to have majority share based on the model split between us and Exynos.\nAs Cristiano indicated in his prepared remarks, one of the benefits of the agreement that we did with them is it gives us predictability on our position within the premium tier going forward. Then from a content perspective there's clearly content expansion happening. And this is really when you look at our premium tier roadmap, not just with Gen AI coming in, our custom CPU cores coming in as well, but then also across other technologies as consumers demand more capability, we see our content and our ASP both continue to grow. Switching over to your second question on automotive, you should really think the way to think about our automotive business is we're tied to the launch of new cars. Clearly the industry is going through a transformation, digitization of cars, and we are right at the intersection of that transformation.\nWe're benefiting as cars put in more infotainment content for experience within the car. More ADAS content comes into the car as well, and really we get to benefit from all those intersection points in the car, and we're increasing the content as new cars launch. So that's maybe the disconnect between some of our peers, what they're seeing, and what we're seeing, stepping back. I mean, clearly this is an industry that's going through some shorter-term dynamics, so we'll be closely monitoring it. But, but when you step back, our technology, our position, and our products look really good, and we're excited about where we're going.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before joining the call?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYes, just in closing, I'd just like to remind everyone, look, we're as I said, we're happy with the quarter. We see the Android market stabilizing after we've been through 2023. There was a year of correction. We like the transition of user experience with Gen AI that could create an opportunity mobile. This is one of those times for Qualcomm that are both our Apple and Samsung revenue on the chip side or under contract. We're very happy about that. We continue to move towards stability of the QTL revenue stream with those new agreements. As you look at the growth opportunity, I think the auto results speak for itself. We're now in the IoT segment really focused on the launch of X Elite in the PC. We announced a new product for XR.\nIf you believe that that market is finally going to get very large scale, we're well positioned with our partnership with Meta as well as Samsung and Google, and as IoT especially industrial goals to the correction, we expect that to resume growth. So we're focused on what we can control. Busy at work with the growth and diversification of the company. And I want to say a big thank you for all of our partners and employees to help us get to this quarter. Thank you very much. I talk to you all next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Cristiano Amon.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q4, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $8.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.02, above the high end of our guidance. Revenues from our chipset business of $7.4 billion reflect a more stable Android handset environment. Licensing business revenues were $1.3 billion during the quarter. We also made significant progress on our leading technology and product roadmaps while improving operational efficiency. We remain fully focused on our future growth and diversification opportunities.\nLet me now discuss key highlights from the business. As we enter the age of Generative AI, we're seeing an unprecedented pace of innovation on device. GenAI is evolving in parallel with GenAI in the cloud, enabling entirely new use cases. It has the potential to change how we interact with our devices, making the user experience more natural, intuitive, relevant, and personal. With increased immediacy, privacy, and security, we have quickly established Qualcomm as a leader in on-device Gen AI for smartphones, next-generation laptops, XR, and automotive, and we are well positioned to benefit from this opportunity.\nWe expect high performance on-device AI to become a requirement over the next few years. Driving content, units, or both. Our Snapdragon platform is highly differentiated from its competitors. First, we significantly increase the AI processing performance and power efficiency of our best-in-class NPU, CPU, and GPU. Second, we are collaborating with multiple partners in ecosystems to enable a host of consumer- and productivity-based AI models running natively on our platform.\nThird, we're enabling multi-billion parameter GenAI models to run continuously and concurrently for multiple use cases, including multimodal. For example, in the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 smartphone platform, state-of-the-art large language models such as Llama and Baichuan, up to 10 billion parameters, are running at up to 20 tokens per second, and large vision models such as Stable Diffusion can generate images from text in less than 1 second with ultra-low power consumption.\nAs always, running on-device GenAI becomes pervasive. We believe it will create one of the most significant changes in user experience similar to the transition from the feature phone to the smartphone and the introduction of the graphical user interface for PCs. Snapdragon will play a significant role in this transformation. We also reached an important milestone in our expansion into PCs and with the announcement of our Snapdragon X Elite platform. It is the result of a relentless pursuit to create the ultimate intelligent computing experience and establish Snapdragon as the industry leader in performance and power efficiency.\nThe Snapdragon X Elite includes our first implementation of the custom Oryon CPU, which exceeds the multi-threaded CPU performance of any x86 or ARM competitor in its class. It also matches the single-threaded CPU peak performance of the leading x86 CPU competitors at 70% less power. Additionally, our premium integrated Adreno GPU delivers up to two times faster performance than the competition at ISO power, or matches competitor peak PC performance at 74% less power. Snapdragon X Elite also features our newest Hexagon NPU with 45 TOPS of performance.\nThe Hexagon NPU is capable of running GenAI models with over 13 billion parameters on device. In total, AI performance of the Snapdragon X Elite across CPU, GPU, and NPU is 75 TOPS, the highest in the industry. Microsoft is redefining the entire Windows experience with the AI Copilot, and the Snapdragon X Elite is built from the ground up for this opportunity. We look forward to PCs powered by Snapdragon X Elite from leading OEMs starting mid 2024.\nThe merging of physical and digital spaces remains a significant future opportunity for Qualcomm, and we recently launched a Snapdragon AR1 platform, our first dedicated platform for smart glasses. AR1 Gen 1 was developed in close collaboration with Meta and powers the new Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.It features a dual ISP camera system for premium photos and videos as well as powerful on-device AI for image enhancement, virtual assistants, real-time translation, visual search, and more.\nTogether with Meta, we're developing next-generation technologies to create the future of spatial computing. The AR1 Gen 1 along with the previously announced Snapdragon XR Gen 2 are a testament to the strength of this long-standing partnership. Across the industry, Snapdragon remains the platform of choice for all leading VR, MR, and AR designs. In networking, we continue to be a global Wi-Fi leader across enterprise and home networks as well as broadband gateways.\nOur Wi-Fi 7 solutions are seeing strong traction with more than 350 design wins across all categories today. We recently announced several new collaborations including with Charter Communications in the US and EE in the UK, both of which are preparing to roll out enhanced next-generation Wi-Fi 7 connectivity to their residential and small- and medium-sized business customers.\nWe're excited about the launch of our Fiber Gateway Platform which adds 10 Gigabit Passive Optical Network capabilities to our portfolio. With fiber in addition to 5G and Wi-Fi 7, we're now positioned to lead in next-generation broadband solutions. Additionally, our unique Service Defined Wi-Fi technology, a signature feature introduced with our Wi-Fi platforms, offers a unified data flow management architecture from cloud to device.\nIt delivers orchestration, classification, scheduling, and insights to enable the end-to-end management of home networks and real-time optimizations across devices. In automotive, the digital transformation of the industry continues to bring new levels of computing intelligence and cloud connectivity to the vehicle. These trends are driving new user experiences, advancements in driver assistance, autonomy, and safety. They also offer the potential for new revenue opportunities as vehicles gain the ability to evolve.\nWith over-the-air updates in digital services, the vehicle is becoming software-defined, and the Snapdragon Digital Chassis remains at the center of this transformation. We are pleased that our Digital Chassis solutions will bring advanced capabilities to the upcoming Cadillac Escalade IQ, which is planned for commercial production in 2024. The Cadillac Escalade IQ will be equipped with the Snapdragon Cockpit, Snapdragon Auto Connectivity, and Snapdragon Ride platforms.\nAdditionally, we're proud of our partnership with BMW for all vehicles as well as the upcoming Neue Klasse. We're also excited that the Snapdragon Digital Cockpit and connectivity solutions now power the new Mercedes-Benz User Experience starting with the 2024 E-Class Sedan. We recently expanded our Digital Chassis offering with the launch of two new platforms for two-wheelers and other vehicle classes such as motorcycles, e-bikes, scooters, and all-terrain vehicles.\nOur new platform design wins and launches with Gogoro, Harley-Davidson, and others are receiving positive feedback from the ecosystem on their ability to advance technology development and bring new user experiences to these vehicles. Finally, we announced a new long-term relationship with Amazon Web Services to enable automakers to integrate cloud technologies into their vehicle development life cycle.\nThe offering combines the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 solution, our Snapdragon Ride platforms, as well as AWS breadth of services and capabilities. This will advance the future of software-defined mobility and change how vehicles are designed and developed in handsets. We announced our latest premium mobile platform, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which delivers industry-leading performance and extraordinary experiences to consumers for the upcoming gen AI era.\nSome key features include intelligent capture with the world's smartest AI-powered camera, console-level gaming with Ray Tracing with global illumination, studio-quality audio, the world's first XPAN technology, best-in-class connectivity, and the world's fastest on-device AI processing on a smartphone. We look forward to flagship device launches powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 by global OEMs and smartphone brands including Xiaomi, Honor, OPPO, Vivo, OnePlus, Sony, and more. In addition, we recently entered into an agreement with Apple to supply Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF Systems for smartphone launches in 2024, 2025, and 2026.\nThis agreement reinforces our track record of sustained leadership across 5G technologies and products. We are proud of our ongoing relationship with Apple as we look forward. Our technology roadmap and has never been stronger and the fundamentals of Qualcomm's growth drivers remain unchanged with significant opportunities in the coming years. We continue to focus on stockholder returns and executing on our ongoing diversification opportunities while maintaining operating discipline. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our fourth fiscal quarter results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $8.7 billion, an EPS of $2.02, which is about the high end of our guidance. QTL revenues of $1.3 billion and EBIT margin of 66% were in line with our expectations. QCT delivered revenues of $7.4 billion, an EBIT margin of 26%, which were near the high end of our guidance on strength in handset and automotive revenues.\nHandset revenues of $5.5 billion increased 4% sequentially and were higher than expectations due to the benefit from the early stages of recovery in Android demand. IoT revenues of $1.4 billion were down 7% quarter-over-quarter, including softness in industrial IoT demand. Automotive revenue grew 23% sequentially to $535 million, making this the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage growth on a year-over-year basis.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% sequentially to $2.2 billion. Before turning to guidance, I'll summarize our fiscal 2023 results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $36 billion and EPS of $8.43. Despite the challenging macro environment, we remain focused on our strategic priorities of extending technology leadership and driving revenue diversification while taking significant steps to improve our operating efficiency.\nWe continued our strong momentum in automotive and delivered record revenues of $1.9 billion with year-over-year growth of 24%, progressing towards our target of greater than $4 billion in revenue by 2026. We exceeded our fiscal 2023 cost action target, reducing non-GAAP operating expenses by 7% relative to the fiscal 2022 exit rate. Executing on our commitment to manage the cost structure given the current operating environment, our business continues to generate strong free cash flow with a record of $9.8 billion.\nLastly, our balance sheet remains strong with $11.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now turning to guidance, we are seeing early signs of stabilization in demand for global 3G, 4G, and 5G handsets. We now estimate that calendar 2023 handsets will be down mid- to high-single-digit percentage relative to calendar 2022, an improvement from our prior expectations.\nIn Q1 2024, we are forecasting revenues of $9.1 to 9.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to 2.45. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.3 to 1.5 billion and EBIT margins of 70% to 74% with sequential growth driven by an increase in global handset units for the holiday season. In QCT we expect revenues of $7.7 to 8.3 billion and EBIT margins of 26% to 28%.\nOn a sequential basis, we estimate double-digit percentage growth for QCT handset revenues and anticipate both IoT and automotive revenues to decline consistent with last year. QCT handset revenue forecast includes the benefit of normalization of Android channel inventory and higher demand due to the acceleration of flagship launches with our newly announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform.\nNotably, QCT handset forecast includes sequential revenue growth of greater than 35% from Chinese OEMs. QCT IoT revenue forecast reflects the industry-wide cyclical factors we have previously discussed, including lower demand and elevated channel inventory. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat relative to the fourth fiscal quarter as we enter fiscal 2024. We are encouraged by the early signs of demand stabilization in handsets and our strong competitive positioning across revenue streams.\nKey industry trends such as heterogeneous mobile computing and on-device generative AI provide a strong foundation for content growth and expansion to new device categories, driving growth opportunities for Qualcomm. In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, and for remaining focused on execution and continuing to deliver industry-leading products. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To queue a question, press star then the number one. To withdraw your question, press star two. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. One moment please for the first question. The first question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYep. Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results here. I guess if I can start with Cristiano, your comments about on device AI becoming pervasive in a few years. I think investors are largely looking for more sort of evidence and validation that this is going to be a key focus area for a lot of OEMs, smartphones, and other device OEMs.\nSo as you look over the next sort of 12 to 18 months, what should investors look at in terms of more validation of either wins or revenues that you expect from the monetization of the trend in relation to what investors can really look to as milestones to validate that this is actually going to be sort of playing out over the next three to four years, and have a follow up?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you so much for your question. For those that have not seen, I think I would recommend to see the highlights of our Snapdragon Tech Summit that just happened a couple weeks ago when we announced the result of investments in gen AI. I'll tell you, Samik, that on the gen AI, as I mentioned, my prepared remarks are evolving in parallel to the cloud, and it's going to have a significant impact in how you change the user experience.\nJust think about a simple use case as you're texting. Every single text that you write could be an input to a model, and that could bring prediction of your behavior and bring other applications. We demonstrated a number of use cases that are under development, but many other OEMs. There are a number of different models from large language models to large vision models.\nOne unique position of Qualcomm. We have many of those models running natively on a platform. We're creating a model zoo for Snapdragon, and you saw announcements from Microsoft, from Meta, from what we're doing over Android. We're doing with our Chinese partners, and you're going to start to see those signs, especially with flagship devices launching in 2024, as you start to see those use cases changing photography, changing messaging, changing scheduling, and changing assistance.\nHow you should think about this financially for us: you have the potential to create a new cycle for phones and will have an impact on increased silicon content. Just to put in perspective, we have significantly increased the processing performance of our AI. Processing in the device or NPU is going to have silicon content, it's going to have an impact on mix, and it's going to have an impact on unit of all of it. It's likely going to start as use cases get developed with flagships launch in 2024. But it could be very significant as you look at the next two to three years.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, got it. For my follow up, I guess you're sounding a lot more positive around the recovery in the Android OEM ecosystem to the smartphone market. I think investors at the same time are grappling with the potential sort of puts and takes, particularly when it comes to your primary or large Android customer Samsung using more in house solutions going forward. So when we think about sort of seasonality beyond the December quarter, particularly around the launch periods, how should we think about your market share with Samsung progressing and what impact does that have relative to your typical seasonality from December to March? Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nVery good question. Let me unpack that question. Let's divide the conversation in two. I think the first part of the conversation, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're happy that the inventory dynamics that we have seen within the Android. Business issues are largely behind us right now. One data point that we provided in Akash's, I think, remarks is sequentially from Q4 fiscal to our guide, we're seeing a total growth of revenue from Chinese OEMs, both in China and outside China, of 35%. I think that shows that our customers are in a great position, I think even facing new entrants in the market.\nIt's also strength of our roadmap and the stabilization of the market. The second question is about Samsung. Look, we're happy with partnership with Samsung. There's the upcoming launch of the GS24. We expect to have the majority share. Our product is really great. I think as I said, we probably have one of the best product roadmaps in the history of the company, especially in the GenAI processing capabilities, and the product is getting better.\nWe were happy to talk about what we have done in PC with our new Oryon CPU. That CPU is coming to mobile, especially in 2025, and we expect even more. I think evolution of GenAI so the roadmap gets better over time. Overall, we're positive about our relationship, relationship with Samsung. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Cowen\n\nThank you very much guys, good afternoon. I guess for my first question, Cristiano, I did pick up on the 35% growth sequentially with China OEMs. You guys, the question I've been getting a ton is around Huawei and what they're doing. So you guys called out, I think last quarter that they were going to be getting some supply on 7-nanometer from SMIC and being able to do some devices themselves.\nYou called out an impact to your revenue. But I think longer term into all of next calendar year, there's some expectation that they might get some more supply, some of it from SMIC on 7-nanometer, some of it from SMIC on 16-nanometer and that might be a unit headwind to some of your other OEM customers. Maybe you can sell into them as well on 4G. If you could unpack a little bit of what's going on with Huawei and how you see it impacting the market in China, that would be helpful. I have a follow up. Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you for the question, Matt. I think maybe separate and first, as we indicated in the last earnings call, I think we indicated that we don't have any more projection of selling our 4G, I think SoCs to Huawei and going forward we don't expect to have any significance. It's going to be a very I think contribution from Huawei. I think the more interesting answer to your question, and that's the reason I provide the 35% data point, is as Huawei launched the device, what we are seeing from our customers is continued, I think, growth from our customers. On the Android side we see a mix improvement of our customers moving towards flagship and it's kind of reflected in our numbers.\nSo it does not change, I think, the trajectory that we have with our Android customers in China, and there is a possibility, I think, that Huawei is upgrading their existing customer base. You know, there is a data point; there's about 100 million Huawei former customers with a four- to five-year-old Huawei phone, and that could have an impact on increasing the tam.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Cowen\n\nThank you, Cristiano. I guess as my follow up, it was very impressive, some of the products that you put forward for the PC market. At the latest Snapdragon Summit, I think you were right to call out the performance levels, the power levels, and the much, much different support from Microsoft. I guess what I'm trying to understand a little bit more is support for ARM PCs, whether in gaming or in enterprise use cases by other ISVs.\nSo folks that might need to use other end applications that wouldn't be touched directly by Qualcomm or directly by Microsoft. Cristiano, could you give us a little bit of an update there? What are you seeing from the ISV ecosystem and in what parts of the PC market do you see potential momentum for your products? Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, there's a lot to unpack here. I can speak about this for the whole day, but I'm going to try to be succinct first thing. We're incredibly proud of the accomplishments of our team. I think Snapdragon X Elite took the leadership position in this space for any mobile computing device. We're incredibly happy with performance of the new CPU, both single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. But not only that, I think it's important to highlight the AI processing capabilities because that's key.\nTo answer your question, if you look versus announcements on NPU or some of the other ARM competitors, we had 45 TOPS performance on the NPU with a total TOPS performance on X Elite of 75, and that aligns with the transition that Microsoft is making towards Windows AI future, especially the new services with the Copilot and everything we're doing with Microsoft on on device, working together on device AI with the cloud and with the Azure endpoint. We're excited about that, and you should start thinking about the PC business.\nAlmost like the auto business, we're focused on next generation PCs, not existing PCs. As those Windows started to switch to Windows AI and our platform launches it create, you know, opportunity for us to start gaining scale. Specifically to your question, Microsoft has been very active together with us in bringing a lot of applications natively to the platform. I think we had significant progress made across consumer and commercial applications.\nYou continue to see announcements, and Windows 11 can also run every x86, 32- and 64-bit [application] through the Microsoft emulation. We also made significant strides in the emulation. So I think Snapdragon X Elite represents the result of this Microsoft Qualcomm collaboration. I'll finish the answer by saying if you look at the announcements of other computing companies talking about having an ARM-based PC processor, that is validation that that's our TAM. Now it is going to be part of the expansion of TAM for Qualcomm. We're a new player, and we look at this as a growth opportunity. We're excited about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMike Walkley ]\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat, thanks. A quick question for Akash. We have strong cost execution coming in ahead of plan for exiting the fiscal 2023 and flattish into the start of Q1. How should we think about OpEx levels planned for the year? Is there more areas to cut or you think you'll remain kind of flattish for the year from a good start?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, thanks Mike for the question. Yeah, we're very happy that we set a target for fiscal 2023 of a reduction of 5% relative to the 2022 exit rate and we came in at 7%. As we've continued to mention, we're committing to operating discipline and we did implement additional actions this quarter proactively. The way we are managing our portfolio is really while we are reducing cost, we want to ensure that we continue to invest appropriately in technology leadership and diversification in some of the areas that Cristiano just went through.\nSo that's the balance we are trying to strike. As we look at the rest of the year again we are committed to maintaining operating discipline as we move forward. I think we're in a very good place from an OpEx perspective. We are investing in the right areas and we'll focus on that scale.\n\nMike Walkley ]\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat, thanks. Kind of building on that. My follow-up question to you, Cristiano. Just a follow-up on the on-device gen AI opportunity. How should we think about the increased dollar content per device for Qualcomm or increased ASPS relative to your high-end Snapdragon chip today? Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nLook, let me start and see if Akash wants to add. Something else to the answer. The way we think about this is, you know, rather than provide a specific dollar amount, it has a mix improvement. It will drive towards a richer mix of higher and premium tier devices. It has an ASP increase especially because of the accelerated performance for AI, and we're combining that with significant advancements in CPU and GPU as well. It has the opportunity to drive units where there's a new upgrade cycle or share gains. Akash, I don't know if you want to add anything.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nWell, maybe just the other thing to keep in mind is outside handsets as we talk about the PC opportunity. Of course, our AI leadership becomes extremely important there, and then also within IoT, we think about Gen AI as something that's going to be a key technology going forward. It'll expand our addressable market, expand the dollars we make per device in that area as well. So it's a much broader play for us, including automotive with ADAS, IoT, and PC.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.Please just hear your questions.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, I want to ask the March quarter seasonality question a little more directly. Akash, can you just give us some of the puts and takes on that March quarter seasonality? I mean, we've got a strong Apple quarter, presumably in December, that rolls off. We've got Samsung that launches, although we can question what the share is. We've got other things going on. Just how do we think about that seasonality in the context of everything that's going on, which would be expecting.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nSure. So let me maybe try to address the shape of the year as a broader comment. I mean we do expect the first quarter and the Q4 to be the strongest quarters within the year, and then Q3, as you know, is typically the lower quarter because we don't have a flagship phone launch that happens during the quarter. But when you step back and kind of look at, as we enter fiscal 2024, we're very happy with kind of the early signs of stabilization in the global handset market. So we are cautiously optimistic as we go forward with demand stabilizing and the normalization of Android channel inventory. We are on a strong trajectory as we go through the year.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGot it. That's helpful. For my second question, I want to ask about the new Apple agreement. So you put that out a little while ago. You're modeling 20% share now in the phone that launches in 2026. So that'll be primarily a fiscal 2027 issue. How should we think about the shape of that in 2024 and the launches that happen in 2024 and 2025? Do we assume that you've got close to 100% of the majority of the units there and then it drops down for modeling purposes to 20% on the 2026 launch or like, what does that look like?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So the way you should think about the new agreement, without kind of going into specifics, the framework is very consistent with the previous agreement. It covers three launches: so the launch in 2024, launch in 2025, and launch in 2026. Again, the framework is consistent with what we had before. For financial planning purposes, we're taking the same approach as we did with last agreement, and that's the 20% you mentioned, where in the last year we are planning as if we're going to get 20% share. You know, to the extent that we get more than that, that would be upside for our plan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just wanted to dive a little bit into the automotive and IoT sides of things. Just a clarification. Your fiscal Q4 guide, Akash, I believe you said they'd be somewhat similar to last year. I just wondered what you meant by that. Then a bigger cyclical question. We've heard a number of different companies talk about inventory burn in those two markets. You guys highlighted it in IoT. So I wondered where we were there. Are you seeing anything in automotive?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nSure. So the financial guidance we gave is that the year-over-year quarter-over-quarter trend from September quarter to the December quarter in automotive and IoT will be consistent with last year. So if you look at last year, automotive was down, I think, 1% or 2%. We're guiding effectively down 1% or 2% or flat for automotive. We obviously had a very strong quarter in the September quarter.\nThe business traction continues to accelerate for us; the product roadmap is great. As Cristiano outlined in his prepared remarks, the relationship with the customers was very strong as well. So we continue to be optimistic, and we're well on our way to execute on the financial targets we have given long term from an IoT perspective. Again, the same guidance that it's consistent with last year.\nWhat the trend we saw between the September and December quarter. Really, when you think about IoT, we're seeing some of the same factors that other players in the industry are seeing. Some demand weakness coupled with channel inventory. As we look forward, we think of Q1 as the bottom for the year for IoT. We expect to strengthen from that point on. Especially as we get into the second half of the fiscal year with the environment normalizing, but then also very increasingly strong traction for our products, we think we'll have a strong second half in IoT.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks for that color. Just wanted to ask a follow up on the gross margin side of things. Cristiano, you talked about AI at the edge across a number of different products, whether it's the PC side, the handset side, et cetera. I just wondered what does that mean to the gross margin within QCT? It seems like it opens up new TAMs on the unit side outside of handsets, probably increases the TAM from a dollar content on the handset side. Does that yield upside to gross margin? About the same. Just what are the puts and takes as we translate all that to the profitability side?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nSure. From a shorter term perspective, as you'll see from our guide, we did very well in September quarter. We're guiding in line for December quarter. I think your question is more of a longer term opportunity of the expansion of our gross margin as we get into these new areas. We definitely agree that I think as we scale in outside handsets, especially in automotive and IoT, we have an opportunity for margin expansion.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYou know Ross, this is Cristiano. Just two things I want to add real quick on the first question, and then on this. As we gain scale in markets, for example such as auto and in certain segments of the IoT like PCs, XR, those things, they also have the opportunity to give us operating margin efficiency because our R&D is highly leveraged, especially on the computing and the connectivity part.\nSo the more that we get scale, we'll continue to probably be accretive to margins. I want to make a quick comment on your IoT. You should look at IoT dynamics. Not all IoT are created equal. I think we have a lot of things within our IoT, so there's existing business that are subject to some of the inventory dynamics, but there are new growth opportunities there.\nWant to remind everyone the PC is in there which is likely going to be material in fiscal 2025. If you think about devices with the X Elite are launching toward the second half of 2024, you have XR, which was still in the early phase of that opportunity has networking, we have fiber. We didn't have it before. So I think we're positioned now to expand in networking with fiber, in 5G and Wi-Fi 7 is positive and you know, it has still an opportunity to move processing to the edge with IoT next. So we're going to be. Those are less subject to some of the cyclical dynamics we're seeing right now for existing business. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next questions are from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThanks for the question, guys. How are you guys thinking about global handset units over your next fiscal year? Then also given your new product launches here, how should we think about Qualcomm ASPs as we progress for the next fiscal year as well?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nIt's Akash. So as we mentioned on the call, we've seen kind of early signs of stabilization in the handset market, including in China. For calendar 2023 we now expect mid- to high-single-digits versus 2022, which is an improvement from what we had before. As we look at 2024, the recent demand stabilization obviously provides a positive setup as we go into the year. So we are cautiously optimistic on how 2024 plays out. But specifically on 5G units, which is really our target market, we expect high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth from 2023 into 2024. So that's kind of the market that we pursue and we think there's growth opportunity there going into next year.\nFrom an ASP perspective, because of all the factors we discussed earlier in the call, with the chips becoming way more capable, especially with Gen AI, we think we are on a good trajectory to continue to expand our ASP consistent with the last three-year trend. So if you look at our last three-year trend, we've added approximately 10% increase in any tier of chipset every year. We think as we look forward, we have the opportunity to do that going forward.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThat's a great update. Thank you. Another question for you quickly. There was some new language in your 10-K around the European Commission proposing regulations around Standard Essential Patents, potentially devaluing those patents. I wasn't familiar with this. How serious do you think that risk could be? And are there any other meaningful developments in any other geographies or are we. All kind of status quo?\n\nAlex Rogers\n\nEVP and President, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, so thanks for that question. This is Alex. So we've been tracking these developments in the European Union. There's actually a variety of parts to this proposed regulation ranging from wanting more transparency and ownership of SEPs and essentiality of SEPs to other issues relating to kind of pre-legal processes and other sorts of regulations that would affect the licensing and go-to-court process.\nThe European Union right now is in what they call a trilogue process. It's going to take a while to get through Parliament, and the member states are going to weigh in. The Commission's going to weigh in. The European Patent Office is actually opposed to parts of the regulation. Ericsson and Nokia, of course, weighing in as well. So this is going to be a fairly messy, just call it, legislative process that will take some number of years to sort out.\nIt's being followed in other jurisdictions. We're following it here in the US. The US Patent and Trademark Office has weighed in. Somewhat negatively, I think, and it's being followed in China as well. So this will kind of play out over some years. It's not that unusual to have a variety of different SEP-related policy initiatives underway in different jurisdictions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, thank you. Good evening. The first question is regarding the overall handset demand and understand the comments you made about 5G units going into next year. I guess one part of the question is with the increase that you saw in the China business, how much of that do you believe was associated with just inventory normalization as opposed to actual more end market units? Then what does that mean for Q2 which has also been somewhat depressed because of the lower handset market? What should we expect on that as we go into next year?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Chris, it's Akash. So the way we think about the handset market is we've seen a stabilization in the market, and we're projecting forward, especially into the December quarter and QTL's guide, as something that stable market represents. We're guiding a midpoint of $1.4 billion. Sequential growth of 11. From in terms of breaking down the revenue growth in QCT between inventory and market, obviously it's kind of difficult to do over a quarter, but we do think that inventory is a big part of it, and it's really the market is stabilizing where it's at, with inventory really driving a majority of the improvement. In addition to our market share position and revenue growth that comes with content increase as new chips get launched.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. With regard to QTL, you know, I guess I'd assume we'd have to see the QTL numbers to come back closer to, you know, where we've seen them in the past. That's going to require some more improvement in end market demand, is that accurate?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, that's right. I mean, QTL revenue forecast is really function of the scale of the overall handset market. So as the scale changes, it would improve QTL revenues as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete Research. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBrett Simpson\n\nSenior Analyst, Arete Research\n\nYeah, thanks very much. My question was really on fiscal 2024 Android smartphone outlook, and I guess there's a lot of moving parts here with Huawei building up their own chipset. We've all seen the volumes they're talking about for next year. You've also got fairly high share in flagship segments for smartphones with Samsung. So just, you know, looking at fiscal 2024, can you perhaps just provide us a framework for whether or not Qualcomm can grow Android handset sales in fiscal 2024? Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nBrett, we're not guiding the full year at this point. We gave you the guidance for Q1, and I gave you an outline as well of how we expect the shape of the year to play out for the overall company. I think those pointers should give you a sense of our view into the year.\n\nBrett Simpson\n\nSenior Analyst, Arete Research\n\nOkay, maybe just to follow up, Akash, in terms of your OpEx plan for fiscal 2024, I mean, we've seen your sales in fiscal 2023 decline. In operating profit down pretty significantly in fiscal 2023. How are you thinking about the OpEx for fiscal 2024? I guess specifically when I look at Qualcomm's headcount, you have over 50,000 people in the business, and a lot of your large, fabless peers have about half that headcount. How do we think about. The sort of spending plan for next year? Just giving the puts and takes here. Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So, Brett, as you're aware, through calendar, through fiscal 2023, we took action on cost reductions a couple times. As I also mentioned, this quarter we've taken additional action. So the idea is how do we maintain operating discipline while continuing to invest in the diversification initiatives that are so important for the company going forward? What you're seeing in our forecast is a representation of those factors.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, thank you so much. I want to ask about market share next year. MediaTek is saying that they are doing great and they're gaining share. Huawei published now their target for 100 million units versus 60 million that they had before. The question is, how do you feel about your market share for handsets sourced within China? What are the areas maybe that you are strong at, what are the areas that you think you'll see more competition. Thanks.\n\nAlex Rogers\n\nEVP and President, Qualcomm\n\nAkash. I will start and maybe you add some quantitative comments. Tal, I think I will say, if you just a recap in fiscal 2023 that just ended, we had a share increase both globally and in China of cellular, and we like, I think, the direction that we have been going as we said will continue to retain majority share at Samsung. We feel good about that relationship going forward, and we have seen traction from premium and high tier of our Chinese OEMs. This in spite of the launch of, and the successful, I think, initial sales of a newcomer, and that's kind of also reflected in the sequential 35% growth. Akash, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to add.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, COO, and CFO, Qualcomm\n\nNo, I'll just say this: competitive environment is no different than what we've had in the past, and really, if you look at our current products and going forward, we think our competitive differentiation is actually accelerating both with our custom CPUs coming into our handset product line and with Gen AI, in addition to other factors that differentiate us. So we're pretty confident as we go forward we're in a good place from a competitive positioning perspective and content increase.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before joining the call?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you all for listening to and participating in the call. I just want to say thank you to our employees, our suppliers, our partners, and I think we've been focused on the things we can control and really focus on building incredible, I think, products as we continue to change Qualcomm from a communications company to a connected computer company and go into new markets. Thank you again, and looking forward to talk to you all next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. And now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Cristiano Amon.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In our Q3, we delivered results consistent with our guidance, with Non-GAAP earnings of $1.87 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. We recorded Q3 Non-GAAP revenues of $8.4 billion, including $7.2 billion from our chipset business and $1.2 billion from our licensing business. This quarter also marked our 11th straight quarter of year-over-year double-digit percentage growth in QCT automotive revenues. We are pleased with our technology, product, and design win execution, positioning us well for continued leadership enhancements and future growth and diversification in automotive and IOT.\nI will now share some highlights from across the business. Our Snapdragon 8-series mobile platforms continue to set the benchmark for premium-tier mobile experiences. Smartphones powered by our Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 represent the top devices according to AnTuTu benchmarks and Android Authority. We are also pleased that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy will again power Samsung's newest flagship device lineup globally, the Galaxy Z Flip 5, Galaxy Z Fold 5, and the Galaxy Tab S9 series. Our fastest Snapdragon ever for Samsung defines a new standard in smartphone computing capabilities, AI experiences, desktop-level gaming features, professional-grade photography, enhanced mobile productivity, and more.\nThis launch underscores Qualcomm and Samsung's mutual commitment to delivering premium consumer experiences for flagship Galaxy devices. We are extremely proud of our successful partnership with Samsung Mobile. We are also pleased to extend Snapdragon experiences to mass-market 5G smartphones. The redesigned Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 mobile platform will bring premium experiences at reduced prices to help drive 4G to 5G migration, especially in new 5G deployments worldwide. We're looking forward to device announcements in the second half of 2023.\nIn automotive, we hosted our first Automotive Summit in Suzhou, China, with more than 1,000 automotive OEMs, tier ones, ecosystem partners, media, analysts, and government officials in attendance. The broad participation at the event demonstrates Qualcomm's strong position as a technology partner to the growing automotive ecosystem worldwide, especially EVs, as well as Snapdragon Digital Chassis technology and product leadership. We also won more than 10 new designs with leading automakers across the globe for next-generation Digital Cockpit and telematics systems.\nIn consumer IoT, the recently announced Meta Quest 3 is the first virtual and mixed reality headset to be powered by a next-generation Snapdragon XR Platform developed in collaboration with Meta. The Quest 3 features two times the graphical performance, higher resolution, and a slimmer, more comfortable form factor than the Quest 2. We're also helping to drive the growing ecosystem of VR and MR developers in China. OPPO recently announced their OPPO MR Glass Developer Edition, powered by Snapdragon XR2 Plus. In compute, our next-generation PC platform with integrated custom Oryon CPUs and a significantly upgraded AI engine remains on track for commercial readiness.\nWe look forward to sharing more information at our Snapdragon Summit in October. In networking IoT, we continue to gain momentum with Wi-Fi 7 customer design wins. As an example, TP-Link expanded its retail, small, and medium business lines by launching five new routers spanning indoor and outdoor deployment scenarios, all based on Qualcomm Networking Pro Wi-Fi 7 platforms. Lastly, we're very pleased to share that we have begun shipping our fixed wireless access solutions in support of Reliance Jio's upcoming 5G FWA service in India.\nIn industrial IoT, we launched a video collaboration platform suite which provides OEMs choice and flexibility for the design and deployment of immersive video conferencing devices across conference rooms, healthcare settings, and at-home video calling with friends and family. Enabling Windows, Android, and Linux on our platforms offers the ability to customize and deploy video conferencing products across diverse environments. Additionally, our platforms offer industry-leading AI-based noise suppression and dynamic framing. We also launched the QCS8550 and QCS4490, our first software-defined IoT solutions at Hannover Messe.\nThese solutions enable next-gen smart cameras, drones, robotics, cloud gaming, industrial handhelds, panels, point-of-sale devices, and more. Lastly, together with Arrow Electronics, we announced a strategic collaboration to accelerate edge and AI adoption through the formation of EdgeLabs, an Arrow Center of Excellence designed to help customers alleviate IoT development challenges while increasing adoption of edge AI across a variety of with an update on our progress in generative AI since the last call. We're very pleased and encouraged by the rapid acceleration of Gen AI at the edge.\nThis presents a significant opportunity for Qualcomm across our end markets. Use cases at the edge are evolving differently than the cloud, given the inherent context, immediacy, privacy, security, application reliability, and personalization capabilities available on-device. For example, in headsets, models such as Stable Diffusion and ControlNet are changing user experiences for content creation and photography. Large language models embedded in the user interface can also enable enhanced virtual assistance. In personal computing, real-time copilots can bring significant enhancements to productivity and creativity, the benefits of which are well understood and very compelling for enterprises across industries.\nWe believe the automotive industry will use some of the most advanced edge AI capabilities, from large language models for personalized and curated content and services, driver and occupant monitoring, and AI virtual assistance to contextual search. ADAS and autonomy applications can be enhanced by the fusion of data from cameras and other sensors for combined real-world perception, drive path prediction, and more. We're helping enable these capabilities and expect Gen AI use cases to extend to XR, edge networking, and industrial IoT. Within the quarter, we expanded our collaborations across the ecosystem, and we are engaged with multiple hyperscalers, OEMs, and ISVs.\nNotably, we recently announced a collaboration with Meta on Llama 2-based AI implementations on flagship smartphones and PCs that will enable developers to create new and exciting Gen AI applications using the AI capabilities of Snapdragon platforms beginning in 2024. Together with Meta, we're working to optimize the execution of Meta's Llama 2 large language models directly on-device. We also announced a focused collaboration with Microsoft to scale AI capabilities and bring best-in-class AI experience to users across consumer, enterprise, and industrial devices.\nAt the Microsoft Build Developer Conference, our own device, Stable Diffusion, was showcased on a Windows on Snapdragon-powered laptop. We're also working with them to enable a host of productivity-based applications with multiple large models running on the device. As part of this collaboration, our AI engine, DirectSDK, is now available to Windows developers to easily accelerate their AI apps on Snapdragon compute platforms. This marks a significant milestone. In summary, we are uniquely positioned to help shape and capitalize on the upcoming on-device Gen AI opportunity.\nOur AI technology is highly differentiated with best-in-class, high-performance, low-power, heterogeneous computing across our CPU, GPU, and NPU. As multi-billion-parameter Gen AI models run pervasively and continuously on-device, we believe our NPU's unparalleled AI processing performance and power efficiency will become a requirement. We look forward to sharing more about our Gen AI-capable products at Snapdragon Summit in October. Before I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to provide an update on how we're managing our business in the current macroeconomic environment.\nWe remain focused on executing our strategy and prioritizing capital and resource allocation on our future growth and diversification opportunities. Simultaneously, we are focused on long-term operating margin targets, all while maintaining technology leadership across wireless connectivity, high-performance, low-power processing, and artificial intelligence. To that end, we're taking a conservative view of the market and will be proactively taking additional cost actions to ensure Qualcomm is well positioned to deliver maximum value for stockholders in an uncertain environment.I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our third fiscal quarter results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $8.4 billion and EPS of $1.87, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. QTL recorded revenues of $1.2 billion and EBITDA margin of 66%, reflecting slightly lower than expected global devices. QCT revenues of $7.2 billion and EBITDA margin of 24% were consistent with the midpoint of our guidance. Handset revenues of $5.3 billion reflected the industry landscape we have previously outlined. IoT revenues increased 7% sequentially to $1.5 billion, driven by consumer and industrial IoT customers.\nWe saw continued momentum in automotive for our Snapdragon Digital Chassis products, with revenues of $434 million, a growth of 13% year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $2.2 billion. We have successfully executed on our fiscal 2023 cost actions and are on track to exceed our commitment of a 5% reduction relative to fiscal 2022 exit rate. During the quarter, the sale of Veoneer's active safety business to Magna was completed for net cash proceeds of $1.5 billion. Before turning to the fourth fiscal quarter guidance, I'll update you on global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units and channel inventory.\nWe continue to estimate that calendar 2023 handset units will be down at least a high single-digit percentage relative to calendar 2022, reflecting the macro environment and a slower recovery in China. This forecast contemplates growth in handset units going into the holiday season. In IoT, channel inventory remains elevated due to weaker demand driven by the broader macroeconomic conditions. Since it remains difficult to predict the timing of a sustained recovery and customers remain cautious with purchases, we continue to operate under the assumption that inventory drawdown dynamics will be a factor through the end of the calendar year.\nTurning to guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $8.1 to $8.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80 to $2. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.15 to $1.35 billion and EBITDA margins of 64% to 68%, driven by a slight sequential increase in global handset units. In QCT, we expect revenues of $6.9 to $7.5 billion and EBITDA margins of 24% to 26%. This forecast is consistent with our prior guidance of muted seasonality in QCT revenues, primarily due to the timing of purchases by a modem-only handset customer.\nOn a sequential basis, we are forecasting Android handset revenues to be roughly flat, with mid-single-digit decline in IoT and low double-digit growth in automotive. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat relative to Q3. As we approach fiscal 2024, our revenue growth will largely depend on macroeconomic environment, global handset units, and China recovery. In Q1, we expect two drivers of sequential revenue growth: QTL seasonality and handset launch by a modem-only customer. In addition, we expect a sequential decline in IoT and automotive revenues, consistent with the seasonal trend we've seen in the last couple of years.\nAs you'll recall, we had previously communicated we would evaluate additional cost actions as the environment continues to evolve. Until we see sustained signs of improving fundamentals, our operating framework does not assume an immediate recovery. Given our commitment to operating discipline, we will proactively implement additional cost actions in H1 2024. This will be incremental to the reductions we have successfully completed in fiscal 2023. Despite these actions, we will preserve investments in our strategic priorities and position ourselves to emerge stronger as the recovery from the broader industry begins to take hold.\nIn closing, we remain focused on executing on our vision to bring connectivity, high-performance, low-power computing, and on-device generative AI to the edge. Our guiding principles remain the same: prioritize technology leadership, accelerate diversification, and drive earnings growth to create value for our stockholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Odoyen\n\nVP Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nTo queue a question, press star, then the number one. To withdraw your question, press star two. If you're using speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. The first question is from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nMD and Senior Equity Research, Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Akash, I guess for my first question, you were kind enough to give us a little bit of color in your prepared script just now on December, and you went through a few things there pretty quickly, so I wanted to double-click on a few. Maybe you could recap for us just the trends you expect in handsets versus IoT and auto that you gave. And in particular, you talked about some seasonality being better in the fourth calendar quarter in the handset market, but that inventory burn was still going to be part of the dynamic.\nSo if you could talk through that in a little bit more detail, what kind of magnitude are you expecting for the industry in the fourth quarter? What's built into your estimates? And is the inventory burn just an Android dynamic, or do you think the pre-purchases from Cupertino are still an effect in the December quarter? Thanks.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nSure, Matt. So there was a lot in there. I'll try to unpack it. Let me divide it into parts. So first, starting with the market, our forecast does assume sequential growth into the December quarter as we go into the holiday season. From a financial perspective, consistent with historical years, we typically have two significant drivers of growth going into December from September. First is QTL, and we expect to see that growth as the market grows as well. And then second is handset launch by a modem-only customer. Off of the base we have in September, we expect to see that growth as well.\nSo those would be the two significant growth drivers into the quarter. From an IoT and automotive perspective, if you look at the last couple of years, we've seen a trend of a slight decline in both areas, quarter over quarter from September to December. So we just think the same seasonality will play out, not something that goes beyond that. It's just normal timing that we've seen in the market in the past. Maybe the last comment I'll say is our forecast for September and December quarter does assume no material revenues from Huawei. As you are aware, we have a 4G license for shipping into Huawei.\nWe do not have a 5G license, and we are not assuming any material revenue going forward. So hopefully that covers all the different parts.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nMD and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. And I have a couple, but maybe, Akash, if we can start with the calendar fourth quarter comment that you just had. If I look back at some of the seasonality that you've typically had in prior years there, we see a wide range, I mean, somewhere between sort of 10% plus to somewhat of a higher number as well in the double digits. Maybe if you can give us a bit more color in terms of, as you think about, you said, in your smartphone outlook as well, a recovery in the December quarter in terms of volumes, how are you thinking about it relative to typical seasonality in the prior years?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So Sameek, maybe no additional comments to what I just said. I think if you look at our history with the growth in the smartphone market, we see QTL grow with it, and so we expect a similar gain this year. Then I'd probably say, similar to on the modem customer side as well, we'd see something similar to what we've seen in the past. I think using historical trend as a way to model it going forward is a reasonable way of doing it for those two factors. Okay.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nMD and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. And for my follow-up, I mean, obviously, the inventory on the balance sheet did come down a bit, but how are you thinking about sort of the opportunity here to sort of discount, to clear some inventory off the balance sheet, or even sort of from an investor's perspective, how should we think about the risk of inventory write-down if the recovery is sluggish for a period of time? How should we think about those drivers given that the inventory drawdown has continued for a longer than expected duration?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So Samik, obviously, our analysis is reflected in our results. We think you well understand the drivers that got us to the inventory balance. It's just the overall industry being weaker, and with six months' lead time, you're planning for a different market. And what we're comfortable with is that we have the inventory on the right parts. There is long lifetime on it, and there is demand for it. So our latest analysis on the topic is reflected in our results.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMike Walkley\n\nRetired Research Analyst, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat. Thanks. Cristiano, I just want to talk about the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 that you talked about. How was the initial uptick in terms of Android demand from your customers looking at that? And do you think, given the supply-demand imbalance, that you'll be able to now make gain share in 2024 as you move downstream on Android?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nHi, Mike. Thanks for the question. So let me just start with the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2. What we like about it is it answers, I think, the market needs to drive now the next wave of 4G to 5G migration. Just as an example, Xiaomi just recently launched the Redmi 12 5G smartphone yesterday in India at an ASP of $135. So we're very encouraged with now the ability to create this 4G to 5G migration. I think there are a number of markets now that are deploying 5G in developing economies. And as you pointed out, now we don't have supply constraint anymore at the mass tier.\nAnd our new product roadmap, we're encouraged about the ability to drive that 4G to 5G migration at those price points.\n\nMike Walkley\n\nRetired Research Analyst, Canaccord Genuity\n\nThanks. Just a quick follow-up. Just on the IoT business, can you give us just an update on the three segments or any of the segments doing better than others in terms of the inventory build, or the outlook that you provided?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nSure, Mike. So this is Akash. I'll start, and maybe Cristiano can add on top of it. So in the short term, the IoT business is seeing some of the same dynamics as you're seeing come through with our peers from a demand side and the impact it has on the inventory, channel inventory. When we saw the initial weakness, it started with consumer, but we did see it go across to other parts of IoT as well, especially within China. But we're pretty happy with the results we had in the June quarter. We were up approximately 7% on revenue. And it was really growth across industrial and consumer that drove that benefit.\nDifficult to kind of predict the timing of recovery and the inventory drawdown. We did say that it would be a factor through the end of the calendar year, but that's the framework for the very short term on IoT side.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nMaybe the only thing I was going to add, Mike, as we indicated multiple times, there's a lot of things in our IoT segment. And there are some of those things that they have yet to materialize. I think we talk about our PC space, which we're excited about, the new product we have been developing with our custom CPUs. We're still in the beginning of virtual reality. We're encouraged by now other players entering the market, which will ignite the developer ecosystem. And I think lastly, on networking, we like the Wi-Fi 7 design win pipeline that could materialize in a new cycle into the future. So as we outlined, there's a number of different things within that segment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please just hear their questions. Ms. Rasgon, your line is open for questions. Perhaps you're on mute.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nMD Senior Analyst US Semiconductors and Capital Equipment, Bernstein Research\n\nHello. Sorry about that. I wanted to ask about chip gross margins. They seemed reasonably strong in the quarter, even with revenues down. They seemed like maybe they were implied up a bit sequentially. The guide seems pretty stable into September. Can you give us any feeling for drivers of the margin pricing mixes? You talked about some additional cost dynamics. I don't know if there's anything in there on the cost of goods side. Some of the dynamics, how should we expect that to evolve? Is it just mixed that drives it going forward, or are there other things that we should think about?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nSure, Stacy. It's Akash. Yeah. We did come in a little bit better than forecasted for the September quarter, and it was really primarily driven by a mix of products. We're guiding approximately flat margins going into September from June. That's a reasonable way of forecasting our margins going forward as well. We expect to be in the range as we go forward.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nMD Senior Analyst US Semiconductors and Capital Equipment, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you. If I could ask one more briefly. Cristiano, you're talking a lot about AI and how that's going to contribute. How does AI actually contribute to the model going forward? Are you anticipating it eventually drives an upgrade cycle, or is it more content, or is it ASPs for the chips fall less than they would otherwise? Or how do we think about how that actually drives the model as adoption happens?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nVery good. Thanks for the question, Stacy. Look, I think I'll unpack the answer to the question. First of all, we're very confident of what we see happening at the edge, on-device. I think there's a number of reasons AI is developing on devices a little bit different than the cloud. Everything that is real-time AI, always-on AI, context, latency, reliability, and personalization. I think that can apply to products across all of our end markets. When it will happen, we are going to announce a new set of products at the Snapdragon Tech Summit that are all going to be Gen AI-capable products that run on phones, on computing products, on all of the other segments in L2 and IoT.\nWe think the monetization will happen two ways, right? The easiest way to think about it is if our customers and our partners that are working with us, we mentioned a few in the prepared remarks, come up with the new use cases, and you have now a Gen AI-capable smartphone, that changes the size of the phone market. It could create an upgrade cycle in between 5G and 6G and changes the size of the market, also improves the mix towards our product lines, and ASP increases. For you to do Gen AI on-device, you need a different computing platform. And that's what we have been doing with our NPU.\nI think it's probably unmatched by any of our peers in the ability to do high-performance AI pervasively and continuously at low power. And we look at those things could create an inflection point. It's hard to predict the timing, but we can see how it changes the mix and improves the ASP in our products.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nMD, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just have one question, one follow-up. On the December quarter soft guide that you gave, Akash, you talked about your modem-only customer having its typical seasonality in the fourth quarter, calendar fourth quarter. What is typical seasonality and/or your expectations for the Android side of things in that quarter?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So from an Android perspective, we expect the quarterly trend to be consistent with history. If you look at what typically happens for us in Android is we launch our new chips in the March quarter, and that's when the new premium tier chip comes out, and that's typically the stronger quarter for us.So it's really driven by timing of product launches. But fundamentally, when you look at our position within Android, even within 2023, we've actually grown share of sell-through from 2022 to 2023. So we continue to be in a very strong position, and it's just the market dynamics that's kind of driving the cyclicality in the business.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nMD, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks for that. And I guess as my follow-up, sticking with you, Akash, on the OpEx side of things, you talked about macro still being uncertain, and so you were going to take actions in the first half of your fiscal 2024 on the cost side of the equation. Could you give us any more color on that? I assume it's largely on the OpEx side. You guys have been successful in hitting your 5% reduction, if not beating it, exiting this year versus last. Any sort of quantification you can provide on what your expectations are for OpEx in that new cost-cutting plan?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nSure. So let me give you the framework of how we're thinking about it, and I don't have quantification at this point. But in 2023, we exceeded the target we set. And as we've said before, we'll continue to look at additional reductions as the environment evolves. So given that, what we're planning to do is proactively implement additional actions in the first half of 2024. And the framework for it is we're going to preserve our strategic priorities. We're going to reduce in certain areas, but then also have the capability to invest in new technology, especially AI, and continue to invest in our diversification plan.\nSo it's really an effort to get our investment portfolio right as consistent with the priorities going forward for the company.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nMD and Senior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nYes, thank you. As a first question, if perhaps you could talk a bit about mix. Where is your mix sitting as compared to where it was last year? And obviously, the mix had skewed higher during times of supply constraints, and now there's greater availability. So how is that affecting margins and revenue? And as things go forward, how do you expect that to change as well? I guess there's some concern that mix shifts down to perhaps some lower end of the portfolio as the 5G cycle matures and emerging markets tend to become a bigger part of the 5G mix.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Chris, that's Akash. If you look at the mix change, it's really happened through the year where we expanded our position in the lower tiers a bit, and it's already reflected in the comments I made earlier to Stacy's question on gross margin. Really no incremental comments to what I said earlier. As we look forward, one of the key opportunities for us is really how do we expand the ASP as just we're continuing to see incremental demand across all tiers for more capability in the chipset. To Cristiano's earlier point, with generative AI becoming so critical in edge devices going forward, it's going to drive an inflection point in terms of our presence there and our ability to expand content.\n\nChris Caso\n\nMD and Senior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. Just a follow-up question about geographic revenue, in particular to the handset business. We've been hearing about perhaps greater macro concerns in China as compared to elsewhere. In terms of normalizing the business and getting the global handset market back to where it once was, is this mainly a situation where we need to see China come back and normalize, or is it more of a global trend? What needs to improve, in other words, to get back to what used to be normal?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, I'd say a couple parts. So we've seen weakness across China and other emerging markets. Those are definitely the two areas. In developed markets, it has largely held. There is some smaller impact, but not as much. I think the opportunity is really across the board. I think one is just from an overall replacement rate perspective, you could see that increase going forward driven by new technology cycles. But also within the emerging markets in China, you could see some normalization of return and demand as things stabilize. So those would be the opportunities.\nJust to be clear, in the guidance that we're giving at this point, we're not including those, and that would be upside to our plan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrett Simpson\n\nPartner and Co-Founder, Arete\n\nYeah, thanks very much. Akash, I had a near-term question on smartphones. I mean, some of your smartphone peers are reporting better fundamentals in the near term. I think MediaTek's in the June quarter, they were up 6% in smartphones, and they're talking about mid-teens growth sequentially in September quarter. And I think Qorvo has also talked about quite a significant uplift in September. And I know you said there's weakness elsewhere in QCT, but can you just maybe hone in on the smartphone business? Can you reconcile with some of the peers and what they're guiding and what you're guiding?\nIs it just really Apple and Huawei is going through a volatile patch for orders, or is it something more structural you think at work? And maybe second question for Cristiano. You talked earlier this year, I think at Mobile World Congress, actually, that you were assuming no Apple business in 2024 because you didn't have orders, any new orders there. Has anything changed with regards to Apple, and how should we think about this relationship beyond calendar 2023? Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Brett, so I'll start with your first question. Let me break it down into Android and Apple in two parts. So within Android, two comments to keep in mind. First is we don't think there's been any significant shift in share between the players over the last few months. However, what has happened is, when you look at our total share of sell-through for 2023 relative to 2022, as I mentioned earlier, we've actually gained share within Android. So we continue to have a very strong position, and kind of the seasonality across the quarters for Android is really the reflection of when devices are launched, and which tiers we play in, which is the premium and high tier, which they center around the holiday season versus midway through the year.\nSo that's how I would think about the Android market. On Apple, as I've said before, we expected muted seasonality in Q4 due to the timing of chipset purchases. We did see them buy additional chipsets earlier in the year. And so what we are forecasting now is expected demand, expected shipments into the next quarter. So that really just speaks to timing again rather than some fundamental trend. As you know, we expect to be a majority of the share in the new upcoming launch, and so it's not really a share question.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nBrett, to your second question, for the iPhone that is launching this year, we are going to support the modem. We're not making any updates to our prior plans for 2024.\n\nBrett Simpson\n\nPartner and Co-Founder, Arete\n\nOkay. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Tal Liani, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTal Liani\n\nMD and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, Hi. Auto market, we spoke a lot about the handsets. I have two questions related. Auto market was also weak. Can you give an update on why it grew 13% versus 16% Street expectations? But this 13% is also lower than what we've seen before. So can you talk about the trends there? IoT was in line with expectations, but it's still declining 24% a year. So what is the trend over there? And on the handset side, I'm just wondering if there was deterioration throughout the quarter or it was improvement throughout the quarter. Kind of what was the intra-quarter trend? Thanks. And sorry, everything is QCT.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nI understand. I understand. On the handset side, really largely in line with what we'd expected. So no trend one way or the other. Auto in our actuals came in slightly below our expectations. However, if you see what we guided for the upcoming quarter, quarter-over-quarter growth, we're guiding low double-digit growth. So it's just timing between the quarters that's impacting it. Within IoT, I'd say very consistent with comments earlier in the call. It's really the overall environment and how it impacts demand and impact on inventory that's what's reflected in our numbers, very consistent with what some of our peers have seen as well.\n\nTal Liani\n\nMD and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd Akash, just clarification on something you said. You said that December should be in line with normal seasonality. I tried to look back at seasonality, and it's inconsistent. It's very hard to speak about normal. How do you define normal seasonality for December?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nIf you break it down into parts, I think you look at QTL growth. We've consistently seen QTL grow as a result of a mix of devices and total market size. So that'd be part one. The second is we've seen the handset market grow primarily due to the launch of flagship device by a modem-only customer. And so we would see that as well. So those are the two factors that would drive the majority of our growth into the December quarter.\n\nTal Liani\n\nMD and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nMD, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. I had two. So Akash, I'm wondering if you can provide more color just on these channel headwinds. You gave a $2 billion number, I think, for December, and then that came down to a billion, or it was supposed to come down to a billion in March, and it was supposed to have been gone by June. Obviously, it's not gone. Can you kind of quantify what the headwind is and maybe also talk? Is that component inventory at your customer still coming down, or is that handset sell-in still being above handset sell-through? And then I had a second question as well.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So, when we talk about channel inventory, we talk about total inventory across, beyond us. So, it's customers and channel both combined. I mean, clearly, as we've gone through the year, the headwinds have been meaningfully higher than we'd expected going into the fiscal year. So, that is reflected in the updates that we're giving. No fundamental change to our view of our share position and overall market we've talked about, as well. So, it's just those factors running through our numbers. We don't have an updated estimate of how much the total impact would be, but it's the same factors that we've been talking about through the year. We've not changed the total market size since the last call.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nMD, UBS\n\nGot it. Thanks. And then just last thing. So, do you have any data on the refurbished market? It seems that it has gotten pretty large, and maybe it's affecting the new Android market. Sort of what portion of the handset TAM this year do you think is used or refurb? Could it be? I mean, we've seen numbers in the 350 million unit range, something like that. So the market is flat down, but the market for new phones is really actually down quite a bit. Can you actually talk to that? Thanks.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nCFO, COO and EVP, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So we have the same data as you do on the refurbished phones. It has grown over the last couple of years. When we give the market the global handset unit information, we're not talking about the refurbished phone. We're talking about new phones. And so it's already factored into the guidance we gave.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you. We just would like to thank all of our employees, our customers, our suppliers, and partners. I think the key messages were we like our strategy, continue to execute on our strategy. We're executing to plan. I think we have one of the best product roadmaps in our history. We like the design traction. And in the current uncertain environment, we're just focused on taking action on things we can control and make sure we're prepared when the market rebounds. Last comment is we see a new inflection point, as I mentioned before, on the edge for GenAI. And what we like about it, for that to happen on device, fundamentally, you need a new computing engine. We have CPU, GPU, but you need something different, which is the NPU.\nI think we have been investing in this for over a decade. We're very happy how it performs, and I would like everybody to follow what we're going to show and announce at the upcoming tech summit in October. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\nPlease refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Cristiano Amon.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today in a challenging macroeconomic environment, and broad downturn across the semiconductor sector. We're pleased to deliver fiscal Q2 results consistent with our prior guidance. We delivered fiscal Q2 revenues of $9.3 billion. Non-GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share were at the midpoint of our guidance.\nOur chipset business delivered revenues of $7.9 billion, near the high end of our guidance range. Our licensing business delivered revenues of $1.3 billion at the low end of the guidance range on weaker demand for handsets. The evolving macroeconomic backdrop has resulted in further demand deterioration, particularly in handsets, at a magnitude greater than we previously forecasted. As a result, we're operating under the assumption that inventory drawdown dynamics remain a significant factor for at least the next couple quarters.\nAdditionally, while expectations are for a rebound in China demand in the second half of the calendar year, we have not seen evidence of meaningful recovery and are not incorporating improvements into our planning assumptions. While the challenges we are facing are impacting the semiconductor industry, we remain focused on managing what is within our control, and we'll continue to execute on our diversification strategy, leading technology, and product roadmap as market visibility remains limited.\nWe're actively managing operating expenses, and we'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities to drive greater operating efficiencies without losing sight of the automotive and IoT growth opportunities ahead. Let me now provide key highlights from across our business. In handsets, we extended our 5G technology and product leadership with the Snapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF System, the world's first 5G Advanced-ready Modem-RF platform that will drive the next phase of new 5G capabilities globally starting in 2024 across segments, device types, and networks.\nThe X75 Modem is now the benchmark for 5G performance and features for all flagship smartphone launches next year. Our Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform is the standard for Android flagship devices globally with launches across leading OEMs including Samsung, Xiaomi, vivo, OPPO, OnePlus, Honor, Motorola, ASUS, and ZTE. Additionally, our Snapdragon 7 series is redefining the high tier. Our recently launched Snapdragon 7 Gen 2 Mobile Platform outperforms its competitors' premium tier solutions, winning multiple accolades for its superior power and performance.\nWe're seeing excellent adoption across Chinese OEMs resulting in share gains. OEMs are also reporting strong initial sales for products powered by the 7 Gen 2. In automotive, we see continued traction across global automakers and Tier 1 customers driven by the increased adoption of our Snapdragon Digital Chassis. We are very pleased to be partnering with Mercedes-Benz on our next-generation Snapdragon Digital Cockpit platforms.\nThis is a result of our long and close collaboration with the Mbition Mercedes-Benz Software factory, engineering teams, and various partners to create an industry-leading MB.OS premium cockpit experience. The new platforms will be featured in Mercedes-Benz vehicles beginning in 2023. Additionally, our OEM partners recently launched vehicles with our third-generation Snapdragon Cockpit platform, including the XPeng P7i and Lotus new Eletre SUV.\nNotably during the quarter, we won 12 new designs across our Snapdragon Cockpit and Snapdragon Connectivity 5G platforms. With automakers across the globe, we remain on track to execute on the milestones outlined during Automotive Investor Day. In consumer IoT, we continue to be encouraged by the positive momentum with Windows on Snapdragon.\nDell recently launched the Inspiron 14-inch laptop powered by the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 Compute Platform. In addition to OEMs, we're expanding our ecosystem across BIOS, hardware, software, ODM, and channel partners. We're also launching the Windows on Snapdragon developer portal to enable consumer and enterprise ISVs to test, port, and optimize their applications directly on Qualcomm Silicon. Our next generation Snapdragon Compute Platform with custom Oryon CPUs and industry-leading AI acceleration is on schedule to enable commercial device launches in 2024.\nAs a reminder, we remain the platform of choice for all significant ecosystem players for XR, notably Meta, the joint partnership with Samsung and Google, and broadly in China. While still in its early phases, we believe the merger of physical and digital spaces will become a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. We also continue to win designs for home robotics, smart appliances, and smart camera applications with household names such as Bosch, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Samsung, and Sony.\nIn edge networking IoT, we're very pleased to share that we're now collaborating with Reliance Jio on rolling out 5G FWA across India, servicing millions of residents. We also recently announced the Qualcomm 5G Fixed Wireless Access Platform Gen 3, offering operators the ability to expand their service coverage to new areas while lowering cost and enabling faster deployment.\nAdditionally, we continue to lead the transition to Wi-Fi 7 with more than 175 cumulative designs across all product categories. Access points account for 89 of these designs with 16 launches in the quarter. In industrial IoT, we announced a Qualcomm Aware Platform to empower developers and enterprises to easily build real-time intelligence and visibility solutions.\nThe platform combines simple, secure, and scalable cloud-based services with power-optimized and precise location tracking, and an extensive hardware ecosystem to deliver tailored edge solutions across many industries. Additionally, we led the Bluetooth SIG Working Group to help establish a new standard for electronic shelf labels that are scalable, ultra-low power, and highly secure. This will help enable large retailers to accelerate the digital transformation of the store with electronic labels that can interact with both store and consumer devices.\nOur OEM partner SES-imagotag recently announced an agreement with Walmart to deploy electronic shelf labels across 500 stores over the next 12 to 18 months. I would now like to provide a perspective on the disruptive trends in the artificial intelligence space and the significant opportunity for Qualcomm.\nDemand for generative artificial intelligence models is growing at an exponential rate. Generative AI models such as ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E have already scaled to millions of users in a short period of time. We believe that these models will evolve quickly, continue to grow in popularity, and change user experiences across mobile, personal computing, and automotive. Beyond changing Internet search, these models will have an impact on content creation such as text, images, audio, and video for both entertainment and productivity. It will also transform many industries.\nFor these models to realize their full potential and scale, they will need to run locally on devices at the edge. At Mobile World Congress we demonstrated the world's first on-device Stable Diffusion, a greater than one billion parameter foundational model for text to image applications running completely on a Snapdragon-powered Android smartphone.\nIn the coming months we will significantly improve performance and be able to run models in excess of 10 billion parameters locally on the device, and we will increase this capability substantially for our products in 2024. Qualcomm is uniquely positioned to enable the proliferation of AI use cases on edge devices. We're advancing AI to make core on-device capabilities ubiquitous such as perception, reasoning, action, and now content creation.\nWith millions of AI-enabled platform shipments per year, unparalleled AI processing performance per watt in the broadest range of device categories from smartphones, PCs, automotive, and IoT, Qualcomm is firmly at the forefront of this upcoming transformation. Further, very large AI models are placing significant incremental demands on energy-intensive and expensive cloud computing infrastructure.\nAs such, a hybrid AI architecture leveraging accelerated computing at the edge can offload or support cloud processing by running AI inferencing directly on the device. Beyond cost optimization, additional benefits of running generative AI on device include improved latency, security, privacy, and the ability to meet data compliance requirements. This is a new and exciting opportunity for Qualcomm and one of our priority investment areas.\nAs I close my prepared remarks, I would like to reiterate that the secular technology trends driving the long-term growth opportunities for Qualcomm remain unchanged despite the disappointing macroeconomic environment. Our investments in technology leadership, our best product roadmap in history, and strategic customer relationships across multiple industries position us well to execute on our strategy and expand across new and diverse end markets. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our second fiscal quarter results. Despite a difficult operating environment, we delivered revenues of $9.3 billion, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.15. QTL recorded revenues of $1.3 billion and EBT margin of 68%, reflecting lower than expected global handset units.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we estimate global handset sell-in units declined by approximately 14%. QCT revenues of $7.9 billion and EBT margin of 27% were both near the high end of our guidance. Handset revenues increased 6% sequentially to $6.1 billion, benefiting from device launches with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, our latest premium tier chipset platform. IoT revenues of $1.4 billion reflected a larger than expected impact of macroeconomic environment on demand and channel inventory drawdown.\nAutomotive revenues of $447 million grew 20% year over year driven by the adoption of our Snapdragon Digital Chassis and are aligned with our long-term revenue target. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.2 billion were favorable relative to our guidance by approximately $80 million.\nWe returned $1.7 billion to stockholders, including $903 million in stock repurchases and $834 million in dividends. Additionally, we are pleased to have announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend consistent with our commitment to dividend growth. Before turning to our third fiscal quarter guidance, I'll give you an update on cyclical challenges impacting the semiconductor industry.\nFinancial headwinds have increased meaningfully relative to our initial expectations going into the fiscal year with a combination of an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, persistent inflation, and a slower recovery in China, which continue to impact demand globally. We now expect global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units in calendar 2023 to be down at least a high single digit percentage relative to calendar 2022, which is lower than our prior expectation given the weaker handset forecast.\nUntil demand normalizes and visibility improves, we anticipate that customers will remain cautious with purchases and reduce channel inventory risk. Further, within IoT, we continue to see the impact of similar factors as handsets. Since it remains difficult to predict the timing of a sustained recovery, we are operating under the assumption that the inventory drawdown dynamics will remain a significant factor for at least the next couple quarters.\nTo effectively navigate this uncertain landscape, we are focused on driving operating efficiencies while maintaining our commitment to invest in diversification and long-term technology leadership. We believe we remain well positioned to capture a rebound in demand once it occurs. We're on track to meet our commitment of a 5% reduction in non-GAAP operating expenses relative to our fiscal 2022 exit rate.\nThis includes a further reduction of spending in handsets to fund diversification investments in automotive and IoT. As the environment continues to evolve, we will evaluate and execute additional cost reduction opportunities to help exceed our operating expense target. Turning to guidance for third fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $8.1 to 8.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.7 to 1.9. Our guidance reflects the impact of macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units, and channel inventory drawdown.\nIn QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.15 to $1.35 billion and EBIT margins of 64% to 68%. In QCT, we expect revenues of $6.9 to $7.5 billion and EBT margin of 23% to 25%. Based on the midpoint of QCT revenue guidance, we estimate a larger than normal sequential decline primarily due to the timing of purchases by a modem-only handset customer. On a sequential basis, we are forecasting Android handsets and automotive revenues to be roughly flat with mid-single-digit growth in IoT.\nConsistent with our previous messaging and Q2 results, QCT gross margins reflect the impact of the transition from supply constraints to elevated channel inventory in addition to foundry cost increases. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat sequentially.\nAs we look ahead, we expect the dynamics impacting the third fiscal quarter to extend to the fourth quarter, including the timing of purchases by a modem-only handset customer resulting in muted seasonality in QCT revenues. In closing, while we are not immune to near-term headwinds, we are well-positioned to benefit from an eventual recovery in the macro environment despite a reduction in global handset units and a continued drawdown of elevated channel inventory.\nQCT handset revenues has benefited from increased content per device, expanded traction with OEMs, and improved mix across tiers. We remain focused on executing our diversification strategy and positioned ourselves for success in our largest growth opportunities including automotive, industrial, and networking, IoT, personal computers, and XR. We're confident in our ability to navigate the current operating environment given our strong balance sheet and debt rating. Thank you. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Qualcomm\n\nThank you Akash. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nTo cue a question, press star, then the number one. To withdraw your question, press star two. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. First question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please receive your question.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for all the details in the prepared remarks. I had one on smartphone and one on auto, so if I can start on the smartphone one. I think I know you're sort of taking down your guidance for the overall market outlook today for 2020, but if I look at your QTL guide, it does sort of imply that you're looking at more of a stabilization in the sell-through at an absolute level.\nSo when I look at your QCT guide, the QCT guide after that, it does suggest that most of the headwinds you're seeing or expecting there are inventory and timing of the purchases. Maybe just sort of confirm if that's the way sort of if I'm interpreting that right. What's the maybe magnitude of the timing and the inventory headwinds to the QCT revenue guide for fiscal Q3? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Samik, you're thinking about it the right way. It's the right thing to connect the market forecast to QTL and then QCT really has this additional factor that is related to the inventory drawdown. Our view of inventory drawdown is really, you know, the macro headwinds increase - have increased meaningfully since the beginning of the fiscal year. So what we've seen is the impact on market is driving a scenario where it takes longer to run through the existing inventory. We don't have a fundamental change in how much inventory we think the channel had going into the year that was excess. It's just how long it takes to run through it as a result of the market forecast.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, okay good. On the auto side, Cristiano, you talked about the 12 design wins, but you mentioned them being in cockpit and connectivity. So I wanted to check if you have an update on ADAS and the engagement from your customers on that front and your product roadmap. Relative to autos, I think there's been some concern about exposure to China volumes in terms of your pipeline. If you can sort of maybe give us some ballpark estimate about how much of your pipeline is reliant on China electric vehicle volumes and how are you thinking about sort of the risk around those production numbers? Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nVery good. Thank you for the question. The 12 designs is what happened in the quarter. So we just highlight in the quarter we had designs on the digital cockpit as well as 5G for telematics. We are working on some new designs on ADAS that is going to take us throughout the second half of the year, but we're not announcing it at this time. The second comment is on China market.\nWe have seen, I think, consistent with the overall theme of China, some weakness in China auto I think, consistent with the rest of the market. But our design and presence with the China EV with the local OEMs is very, very high, and I think we continue to gain share.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Matt Ramsay, TD Cowen. Please receive your question.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes, thank you very much guys. Good afternoon. I have two questions. I guess I'll just ask them at the same time to make this quicker. The first one, Cristiano, in China you were pretty clear in your script, and I think you guys were earlier than most bellwether companies in flagging this, but that the recovery in China in the second half of the year might be a bit more muted.\nI think during the peak, obviously things were being overshipped into China. During the peak I think we were 500 million units give or take on an annualized basis in China, and I think we're running closer to 300 million now on a sell-through basis. Maybe you could update us, are those numbers roughly right, and what are you guys seeing in terms of a recovery, and maybe how much are you under shipping that today, that could still help your numbers in the back half of the year as you come back to shipping with parity of sell-through? I guess I do have a follow up but maybe we'll just do that one first. Thanks\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nMatt, it's Akash. In terms of China sell-through, I think if you're looking at any of the analyst resources that's sizing the scale of the market, we're seeing pretty much the same numbers. That's what you're quoting. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but that's what you're quoting. It'd be consistent. The way we are thinking about the inventory drawdown is of course it's a near-term phenomenon. We're going to get past it. The strength of our design win pipeline is very strong. So if one way to measure it in our minds is we look at our share of sell-through and we've seen that share grow from 2022 to 2023. So that should give you a sense of our position going into the next year.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nMatt, this is Cristiano, I just want to add one thing, you know, common sense, and I think the overall expectation is, following the reopening, the China market was going to bounce back. It has been very suppressed, I think, during the lockdown and during the pandemic.\nI think what we basically saying is we have not seen those signs yet. So therefore, we thought that prudent not to put in our planning assumptions. We're still going to be monitoring the situation, but the dynamic we see right now is exactly what Akash outlined. It's an inventory drawdown, and that's why I think the difference between the QCT and the QTL business.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you, guys. As my follow-up, mid-single digits up, I think, in the guidance you mentioned for IoT. There's sort of three different segments of the business there. If you could. There's been an inventory correction across the IoT business, and I think many of us have less visibility on a granular basis there than in your handset business. So if you could just talk through the dynamics of that business, recovering a bit in June, that'd be helpful. Thank you.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nSure. So it's Akash. The initial weakness that we saw in IoT was in consumer, and then we've kind of seen that expanded into industrial and edge networking, and specifically China playing a significant role in that weakness. So it's a combination of all three areas. Now as we look forward, a lot of the growth that we're expecting within the quarter is actually going to be recovery across all three.\nSo there isn't one that stands out that I would point to. And then maybe the last point on IoT is really when you step back and think about the broader digital transformation process and where we are at, our technologies continue to become more relevant. Cristiano talked about edge AI, and that's going to be another technology that's going to be extremely important in industrial, PC, XR, and other areas. So, still very optimistic about how things look longer term, and we'll kind of work through everything in the short term.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please receive a few questions.\n\nMike Walkley\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat, thanks. Christiano, just a follow-on question for you. Just on the market dynamics, you made some comments about how well the Snapdragon 7 is performing relative to a premium tier from your competitor. Can you talk about design wins, traction, and share gains you're seeing maybe further downstream from the premium tier? Once inventory clears, do you think that you start to see some sharper share gains coming back maybe, you know, into Chinese New Year, into calendar Q4 that's too early to call on the inventory side?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nHey Mike, thank you for your question. I will say we are no longer in, and that's probably an understatement right, we're no longer into a supply constrained environment. So as the supply constraint environment got resolved, we have the ability to gain share. And I think as Akash outlined, if you look at our share of activations in sell-through compared to 2022, you see a very positive picture for us. In China we've been gaining share on what we call the high tier, the new seven series.\nWe made a lot of investment including leveraging the Snapdragon brand in the positioning of the seven, very well received in the market. Our 7+ outperforms, I think, the competition premium tier and we like it because it sets the floor, then you have Snapdragon very uniquely positioned in the 8-series. And I think as outlined from a share perspective, we're gaining share just the whole market still going to the dynamic that we just outlined on inventory. But we like our position in the marketplace.\n\nMike Walkley\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Canaccord Genuity\n\nGreat, thanks. Maybe a quick follow up for Akash just on QCT margins, just given the inventory work there, is there any mix or anything else we should think about on QCT margins as you go through this inventory clearing and less modem only shipments over the next couple quarters?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So from a gross margin perspective, as we've consistently said, and I said this in the last call, last earnings call as well, once we get past supply constraint, we expected some pressure on gross margins. So you're seeing that come through. But if you step back from that and just look at mix of devices and how that drives margin one way or the other, there isn't anything that's significant enough to discuss. It's really the current environment playing through. Then as we look forward, us remaining disciplined with pricing as we grow in a mature market.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I was wondering if you could define what you mean by muted seasonality for September quarter. I think you're usually up. I mean, it's not uncommon for you to be up double digits. What are you thinking now? I guess maybe if you could talk a little bit about the different drivers: handset, IoT, auto into Q4?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nSure. Stacy, it's Akash. If you look at our typical seasonality from Q3 to Q4, it's really driven primarily by the launch of a new flagship device and the build that happens for that device. Outside of that, there are some other puts and takes, but that's the primary driver of the growth.\nWhat we're suggesting is, as I outlined in the prepared remarks, we expect that to be muted because the lower demand from the modem-only handset customer extends from June into the September quarter as well. The reason for this is we saw them buy a little more earlier in the year. So this is just kind of balancing purchases of chips from us. To be clear, this is not a comment. To be clear, this is not a comment on their sell-through, and it's not a comment on our share within the OEM either. This was just the timing of purchases of chips from us.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you. For my follow-up, I know you said you expect the inventory drawdown to last the next couple of quarters, but I guess in June, do you think the magnitude of the drawdown is better or worse, or about the same as what you saw in March? I'm just trying to gauge, you know, directionally, is it getting at least better or worse, even though we know it's still there?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So honestly, Stacy, there's a different story with every OEM. There are certain OEMs who are much further ahead in reducing the inventory profile. There are others, including the ones we just discussed happening over the next couple quarters. So I haven't specifically sized it in terms of scale, but I would say each of the quarters has an impact from that phenomenon.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Cristiano. I just wanted to focus on the diversification side of things. I know organically what you're doing in IoT and automotive. Are there inorganic opportunities to accelerate that or is the diversification effort going to just simply take time? Because automotive and IoT are great markets, but they take a reasonable amount of time to penetrate, especially given their relatively smaller size versus your handset oriented businesses.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nThank you. Thank you, Ross. Look, there are inorganic opportunities that we continue to look into the market. We've been clear, we have been focused in identifying M and A opportunity to help us to accelerate diversification. We've been very careful just because in the current environment we wanted to do something that is actionable, and we'll continue down this process of identifying, but we are looking at inorganic options as well to accelerate diversification.\nWe also very excited about what I mentioned into the prepared remarks. I think this incredible opportunity that we now have, we're very uniquely positioned to do AI at a very high performance and low power and all the devices at the edge. And I think that's going to accelerate our diversification strategy across all the new segments.Even though it could create a new upgrade cycle in phones, but it's going to be relevant to all of the other segments of diversification as well.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks for that, Cristiano. I guess one for Akash is my follow-up on the handset segment. It looks like you're guiding that down kind of low teens sequentially. I know you said Android flat and the modem only customer would be the headwind. How is Android flat? If you still are saying macro is a problem, inventory burns a problem, et cetera, is that just evidence of the share gain or what's going on there?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. I assume your question, Ross, was related to QCT?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nIs QCT what you guys call them, that's not aggregate?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah. So, if you think about our historical kind of trend between these two quarters in the Android business, we're staying very consistent with that this quarter. I mean, if you look at last year, Q2 to Q3, our Android business was roughly flat, and we're guiding the same this year. So it's just following the same trend and the factors, the market, and inventory drawdown exist in both quarters.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from the line of Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley. Please receive your questions.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. I guess as you look at the year on year decline in handsets, you know, how much of that would you attribute to, you know, inventory build in a year ago, inventory depletion now, or any kind of change in kind of like for like pricing? Can you just kind of separate out those three factors?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Joe, we haven't talked about it or given specific numbers on it, but one of the frameworks to look at it would be to look at the two years combined. One year had the build, the second year has the bleed. If you look at that combined, it will give you a framework of what the run rate strength of the business is. The other thing I would say is just the one thing to calibrate in that framework is also to look at the market size as the overall market has continued to come down. But that's, I think, a good way to at least start figuring out the run rate of the business.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thank you. Then you mentioned, you know, you always sort of felt like as you came out of an allocation mode that there'd be a little bit of gross margin headwind. What causes that? Is it just, you know, that are there expedite fees you were getting before? Is it more promotional now? Has there been any change in kind of like for like pricing as you kind of moved out of that tight supply environment?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, so it's a combination of them. I mean, given supply constraints, we were able to exercise some pricing leverage that gets neutralized in the current excess inventory environment. So that's just playing out through the numbers. The other two factors to keep in mind is we had a price increase from foundry that ran through starting 1 January as well. Some underutilization in RF front-end fabs that over time will get filled back in as demand comes back. So that should be a tailwind for us going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I had two, but maybe just following up on that last one on gross margin. I mean, I guess if I'm looking at the numbers, seems like your ASP is still going up. Is it really just the higher cost? And I guess second part of it is I think there's a lot of concern about more competitive environment, MediaTek moving up to the high end.\nSo just, can you go back and just talk about that environment? I think you said there's not more like for like. But I mean, I think there's a lot of concern about maybe people buying older products down and not taking Gen 2 and MediaTek moving up. Just kind of touch on those points.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Blayne. So I'll address the first part and then Cristiano will address the second part on gross margin percentage. I think it's a reasonable way of thinking about it. Our gross margin dollars per device continues to grow and that's the strength and it kind of adds scale and profitability to the business. But we have seen gross margin percent get impacted by the couple factors I just outlined.\nBut again, those are to me kind of ins and outs of the business. It's better to kind of step back and look at the broader, longer term opportunity for us to continue to add content to our chips, which we have done very successfully over the last three years.\nWe have an opportunity to do that especially with our new custom CPU cores coming into play into all of our product lines, including handsets, and then with the AI that Cristiano just outlined, that will create an opportunity for us as well.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks for that. Go ahead. Sorry.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nNo, I'm sorry. I'm just going to add a couple comments to your specific questions. Look, the way we see this, we have done, I think, the right choices of investment. We feel pretty good about the roadmap, and we took this very, very focused strategy and make sure that our seven tier outperforms the competition premium tier, and that changes the landscape, which means we are very well positioned above that in the eight. As I outlined, our design traction is very good, especially.\nWithin all of the OEMs, no exception. I remind you that we are globally with Samsung, you know, our agreement with them. We have the launch of GS23 that just happened. Then we have the fold and flip, and then we have the GS24. It's going to be a number of years as association of Samsung with Snapdragon brand globally, and the size of the market is not good. But our position is very strong, and as I outlined before, we're gaining share.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGotcha. And then, if I could just follow up with the modem only in terms of the timing. I guess you guys have been waiting if there's any decision of that customer to move away. I'm just curious if that timing you would be notified at this point or if you thought that that timing of shipments had anything to do with their transition.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nNo, it has nothing to do with the transition. For this transition, I think we said a number of earnings calls ago that we're expecting to be in the product that they launched in 2023 and in 2024. We have no change to our planning assumptions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brett Simpson, Arete Research. Please receive your questions.\n\nBrett Simpson\n\nSenior Analyst, Arete Research\n\nYeah, thanks very much Cristiano. I wanted to ask about the state of the Android market. There seems to be a sort of consistent structural share loss here, and I guess even going back pre-COVID, Apple has been growing their business, since COVID and Android just seems to keep losing share.\nSo what do you think is going on, and how much of the structural decline in Android do you think is the secondhand iPhone market? Then I don't know whether you can size this, how big do you think the secondhand market is, and how it's affecting Android, and what do you think the Android value chain is going to do to reboot their business? Thank you.\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, no, it's a great question, and there are a number of things to unpack. So first, I just want to go back a little bit. In recent history, I think there was an addressable market for premium devices and, to some extent, premium and high-tier devices that became available as Huawei declined in share. In reality, Apple picked up a significant amount of their share. We did as well, I think, so as our competition.\nI think everyone had grew as the expense of the market, and I think that is resulting to a much larger - you look at that. Huawei Android is a net loss of Android, and that's for the areas that Apple gained share. The market, it's smaller, and those, even the component of hand-me-down phones, it's accounted in our planning of a smaller market. I think that's where we are until we go to the next upgrade of cycle - cyclical business but our position in Android has improved, and I think if you look over trajectory actually on the smaller Android market we've been gaining share and focus on the value share of the market with concentration and the high and the middle tier.\n\nBrett Simpson\n\nSenior Analyst, Arete Research\n\nDo you think the second end market is growing structurally? I mean just to understand the dynamics. Because some of the data we've seen. It would suggest that this is starting to have an impact on Android volumes.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nYeah, Brett, it's Akash. I divide this into two parts. I think there's a second end market that has been around for a long period of time in emerging markets as a hand-me-down device, and so that obviously still exists. There has been a little bit of a change at the top with the refurbished phone market, and so that's something that we're definitely closely watching and contemplated in our numbers at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please receive your questions.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks. Akash, sometimes you give us more indications of future quarters. I wanted to ask about QTL, QCT for the September quarter. Can you provide us some comments on your expectations?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nSure, Tal. For QTL, typically the market size is relatively flat between the June and the September quarter. There is a slight change in the market, and our revenue is relatively flat as well. So you should think of that as a proxy based on historical trend. There isn't something specific going on this year that I'd say is different than last year pending a recovery in the market.\nFrom a QCT perspective on the fourth quarter, we typically have seasonality, seasonal growth. What I said in my prepared remarks is that we expect muted seasonality this year because of all the factors that we've been discussing on this call and have been outlined in the prepared remarks as well. So that would be a framework to come up with a number for September. Then obviously as we go from there, you go into the holiday season, that's typically a strong quarter for us and we would realize benefits as we go there.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nWhat's normal seasonality for Q4, for QCT? When you say muted, what's your benchmark?\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nEVP, CFO, and COO, Qualcomm\n\nWell, I would say if you look at last year, you would probably come up with a number that would be normal, and we don't expect to be close to that. We'll see a lot of different factors. We don't have, to be honest, that clear insight into quarters at this point to give a forecast. So if you can wait for the next call, we'll definitely be updating you on that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before joining the call?\n\nCristiano Amon\n\nPresident and CEO, Qualcomm\n\nYes, thank you so much for listening to our call. Here's the summary. Like, from our perspective, why are the market conditions remain challenging? We're very confident to reach our Q3 estimates at this point. We're taking action where we can control as we navigate the near term headwinds. But it's most important we'll continue to execute on our strategy.\nWe like our strategy. I think we invest in the right technologies for growth and diversification, especially in the IoT and auto. I feel we have a very competitive roadmap so we're well positioned to benefit when the market returns to growth. I think the last comment is we are going to become very relevant in AI as you look at the speed of new models appearing, new companies investing, new use cases, the ability to run those things locally.\nI talk about having the ability to run 10 billion parameter models on the phone without compromising battery life and be able to demonstrate that very shortly in this year. And you can see how that creates an even larger opportunity for us in automotive as well as the entering of next-generation personal computing. So we're excited about that.\nWe'll continue to invest in this area. In summary, we're very focused on our long-term success and we steadfast our commitment to drive maximum value for our stakeholders. I want to thank all the employees for the dedications and contributions to Qualcomm, as are our many partners and suppliers. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Thanks for joining us today. Fiscal '22 has been a strong year for Qualcomm with record performance in our chipset business and a strong execution of our diversification and growth strategy. We remain focused on continuing to transition Qualcomm from a wireless communications company for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge.\nWe're driving the transformation of industries and growth of the digital economy by powering the billions of smart connected devices at the edge, utilizing our One Technology Roadmap with leadership in wireless connectivity, high-performance, low-power computing and on-device AI. While the semiconductor industry is being impacted by significant macroeconomic headwinds and other short-term challenges from which we're not immune, the fundamentals of Qualcomm's growth drivers remain unchanged with significant opportunities in the coming years.\nIn Q4, we delivered record revenues of $11.4 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.13, reflecting record revenues in our chipset business and solid performance in licensing. QCT revenues of $9.9 billion were up 28% year-over-year, including record performance across handsets, automotive and IoT. Fiscal '22 revenues of $44 billion were up 32% year-over-year. QCT, the growth engine of the company, contributed revenues of $37.7 billion, up 39% year-over-year, with combined fiscal year IoT and automotive revenues growing 38% year-over-year. QTL delivered $6.4 billion in revenues.\nLet me now summarize a few highlights from the fiscal year. In handsets, we entered into a new multiyear agreement with Samsung, expanding the use of Snapdragon platforms for future premium Samsung Galaxy products globally. We also executed on the changing OEM landscape opportunity, securing key premium and high-tier design wins with our customers in China. Snapdragon has become synonymous with premium mobile experiences worldwide.\nIn automotive, our design win pipeline across connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS is now greater than $30 billion. We also completed the acquisition of Arriver, which enhances our ability to deliver open, scalable, fully integrated and competitive ADAS solutions. Importantly, we have firmly established ourselves as a key strategic and technology partner for the automotive industry, and the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is now the preferred platform for next-generation vehicles.\nIn IoT, we extended our chipset road map to capitalize on trends driving the connected intelligent edge, notably, the conversions of personal computing with mobile; the intersection of physical and virtual spaces; the enterprise transformation of the home; the expansion of broadband; and the ongoing digital transformation across many verticals.\nIn consumer IoT, we increased OEM design wins in ecosystem traction for our next-generation Windows on Snapdragon solutions, which incorporate our custom CPUs. The game-changing AI capabilities of our Snapdragon compute platform recently demonstrated at Microsoft Ignite 2022 developer conference will redefine user experiences on Windows 11.\nWe also announced a multiyear agreement with Meta to develop premium virtual reality and mixed reality experiences starting with next-generation devices powered by custom Snapdragon XR platforms. We continue to be a leading platform provider for virtually all commercially available and announced XR devices and remain well positioned as XR develops.\nIn edge networking IoT, we have seen positive share traction related to the rollout of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E solutions for enterprise access points and retail mesh systems. And we are seeing strong interest in new design wins for our Wi-Fi 7 solutions. Additionally, our 5G fixed wireless access broadband solution is now the industry's platform of choice for wireless fiber globally.\nIn industrial IoT, we built a strong foundation for growth with significant wins across industrial handhelds, robotics, payments, gateways, smart camera, enterprise collaboration and edge processing. The growing diversity of these end markets position us well to benefit from durable and margin-accretive growth opportunities in industrial.\nIn licensing, we extended our agreement with Samsung through 2030, establishing an important benchmark for the long term and for future renegotiations. In addition to delivering record financial results, our fiscal '22 achievements validate our strategy and have provided a strong foundation for long-term growth.\nAs we look to fiscal '23, further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and extended China COVID restrictions have resulted in demand weakness and temporary elevated channel inventory across the industry. As good stewards of capital for our stockholders, we are committed to managing our business in light of the current environment without losing sight of the significant growth opportunities ahead.\nTo that end, we're being very disciplined in managing operating expenses while optimizing our R&D investments to prudently focus on growth within automotive and IoT. We have already implemented a hiring freeze, and we have planned spending reductions across our mature product areas and SG&A to fund our diversification. We are continuing to evaluate additional actions, and we are prepared and committed to making further reductions to operating expenses as needed.\nIt is important to note that the current inventory drawdown is a cyclical adjustment that has no impact on the underlying growth and earnings power of the company in the long term. And we are in a strong position to manage the near-term headwinds.\nBeyond 2023, we see a number of our strategic growth initiatives increasing in scale. We anticipate automotive revenues will grow consistent with our Auto Investor Day projections as the design win pipeline materializes. We expect to see an inflection point in Windows on Snapdragon PCs in 2024 based on a significant number of design wins to date.\nXR is just at the beginning of its growth curve. 5G wireless fiber presents significant opportunities in regions such as India and other developing economies that have just started to deploy 5G networks. Lastly, the digital transformation of industries will continue to gain momentum, driving connectivity and intelligence at the edge.\nIn summary, despite the short-term challenges, the fundamentals of our growth strategy remain intact. We remain confident in our ability to navigate the current economic downturn given our strong balance sheet and consistent history of strong free cash flow generation. We will continue to focus on stockholder returns and executing on our ongoing diversification opportunities.\nThe powerful secular tailwinds driving multiyear demand for our One Technology Roadmap across multiple end industries are unchanged and resilient. We remain on track to expand our addressable market by more than 7x to approximately $700 billion in the next decade and firmly establish Qualcomm as the connected processor company for the intelligent edge.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nChief Financial Officer, Qualcomm Incorporated\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. In a challenging macroeconomic environment, we are pleased to announce strong fourth quarter results with record revenues of $11.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.13. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 22% and 23% in revenues and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QCT.\nThis was also a record quarter for QCT revenues of $9.9 billion and EBT margin of 34%, both above the midpoint of our guidance with year-over-year revenue growth of 28% and EBT dollar growth of 37%. Handset revenues of $6.6 billion increased 40% versus the year ago quarter on strength of our Snapdragon product portfolio across premium and high tiers.\nAs expected, RF front-end revenues of $992 million were impacted by the continued weakness of the handset market and channel inventory. IoT revenues were up 24% year-over-year to $1.9 billion on growth across edge networking and industrial IoT.\nAutomotive revenues of $427 million grew 58% versus the year ago quarter due to the broad adoption of our Snapdragon Digital Chassis. QTL revenues of $1.4 billion and EBT margin of 69% reflected the impact of lower handset units relative to our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.\nTurning to fiscal '22 results. We delivered record non-GAAP revenues and EPS with year-over-year growth of 32% and 47%, respectively. In addition, looking over the past 2 fiscal years, we've more than doubled our non-GAAP revenues and almost tripled non-GAAP EPS from fiscal '20 to fiscal '22, underscoring the strong momentum across our businesses.\nIn QCT, we had records across all revenue streams as well as approximately 500 basis points of EBT margin expansion from 29% in fiscal '21 to 34% in fiscal '22. We are pleased with the continued success of our diversification strategy as we delivered year-over-year combined revenue growth of 38% across IoT and automotive.\nLastly, we continue to be disciplined in delivering long-term stockholder value. We executed on our capital return commitments, returning 93% of our free cash flow, including $3.2 billion in dividends and $3.1 billion in stock repurchases.\nBefore turning to first quarter guidance, I'll address how our near-term financial outlook is impacted by the challenges facing the semiconductor industry. As we communicated during the last earnings call, we had started to see a deceleration in demand for mass-tier handsets in consumer IoT. Since then, the further deterioration of macroeconomic environment and sustained COVID restrictions in China have led to broad-based demand weakening across tiers and regions.\nGiven these considerations, we now project 3G, 4G, 5G handset volumes in calendar 2022 to decline by low double digits on a year-over-year basis, including 600 million to 650 million 5G handsets. This rapid deterioration in demand and easing of supply constraints across the semiconductor industry have resulted in elevated channel inventory.\nDue to these elevated levels, our largest customers have made significant changes to their inventory policy. They are now drawing down on their inventory, negatively impacting our near-term financial performance.\nBased on our current assessment, we estimate that there are roughly 8 to 10 weeks of elevated inventory in the channel. While the environment is very dynamic, based on the information we have today, we believe this may take a couple of quarters to work itself through with more than half of the inventory drawdown completed in the first fiscal quarter. We are confident in our ability to navigate this environment successfully, and we'll continue to monitor inventory levels and order patterns closely.\nAs Cristiano outlined, while we navigate this downturn, we've already implemented specific actions to manage our spending levels, including a hiring freeze and reductions in handsets, other mature product areas and SG&A. We will remain disciplined and be prepared to take further decisive actions on additional reductions to operating expenses if the macroeconomic environment continues to deteriorate.\nTurning to guidance for the first fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $9.2 billion to $10 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.45. The midpoint of our guidance includes an estimated impact of approximately $2 billion in revenue and $0.80 in EPS related to the drawdown of channel inventory with the remaining impact primarily due to weaker end-market demand and foreign exchange headwinds.\nIn QCT, we expect revenues of $7.7 billion to $8.3 billion and EBT margins of 26% to 28%. Following the record performance in fourth quarter, we expect our handsets and IoT revenue streams to be down sequentially due to the impacts I just described. On a year-over-year basis, we still expect revenue growth across IoT and automotive.\nWe estimate QTL revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 71% to 75%. This estimate reflects the updated handset forecast, including a muted seasonal benefit for the holiday quarter and approximately $50 million headwind from foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. Lastly, we now anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to decrease 3% to 5% sequentially.\nBefore I conclude, I'd like to provide an update on RF front-end revenue stream disclosure and planning assumption for Apple product revenues. We have grown our RF front-end revenues to become the #1 player in handsets due to the breadth and strength of our product portfolio. Looking forward, we expect growth to be driven by our strong design win pipeline for 5G and Wi-Fi 7 platforms across handsets, automotive and IoT.\nAs a result, starting in fiscal '23, we will consolidate RF front-end revenues within handsets, automotive and IoT revenue streams. In addition, we'll continue to provide periodic updates on the combined RF front-end revenues against our Investor Day target.\nFor Apple product revenue, we now expect to have the vast majority of share of 5G modems for the 2023 iPhone launch, up from our previous 20% assumption. Beyond this, there are no changes to our planning assumption, and we are assuming minimal contribution from Apple product revenues in fiscal '25.\nIn closing, while the current backdrop presents near-term headwinds for our industry, we remain confident in our leading technology road map, deep customer relationships and strong balance sheet to help us navigate these challenges and maintain our leadership position. Our diversification strategy and long-term growth opportunities remain intact as we continue to drive our vision to bring cloud connectivity, data processing and artificial intelligence to the edge.\nThank you. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Qualcomm Incorporated\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

And now to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Cristiano Amon.\nCristiano Amon;President and Chief Executive Officer^ Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our performance in fiscal Q3 and how we continue to execute on our long-term vision of enabling a world where everyone and everything is intelligently connected. As we continue to scale our one technology road map across new industries and applications, we are transforming Qualcomm from a communications company for the mobile industry into a connected processor company for the intelligent edge.\nThis quarter, we delivered revenues of $10.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.96 per share, driven by solid results in both our chipset and licensing businesses. In our chipset business, revenues of $9.4 billion were up 45% year-over-year with record revenues in IoT and automotive, demonstrating the success of our diversification strategy.\nBefore I highlight a few notable milestones this quarter, I would like to update you on an important development in our relationship with Samsung. We're very pleased to report that Qualcomm and Samsung have entered a new multiyear agreement starting in 2023, expanding the use of Snapdragon platforms for future premiums Samsung Galaxy products globally.\nThis validates that Snapdragon is the technology platform of choice for premium Android experiences. In addition to Galaxy smartphones, the agreement includes PCs, tablets, extended reality and more. We have also agreed to a 7-year extension of our patent license agreement with Samsung, taking the license through the end of 2030 with the same royalty terms.\nThe extension encompasses 3G, 4G and 5G technologies and devices and will also include future 6G standards and products. This license agreement is a significant QTL milestone event. Samsung is the world's largest smartphone supplier by unit volume with a well-developed portfolio of patents.\nThe extended license agreement with Samsung demonstrates the tremendous ongoing value of our patent portfolio, our innovation and our long-standing leadership in driving the important and foundational elements of the mobile road map. The extended Samsung license agreement is an important benchmark for the long term and adds significantly to the stability of the QTL program going forward.\nLet me now share some of the key achievements from the quarter. In automotive, the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is fast becoming the industry's platform of choice and is enabling the transition to next-generation vehicles. We are very pleased with the continued traction and design wins across global automakers and Tier 1 partners.\nOur automotive design win pipeline is now over $19 billion, up approximately $3 billion since fiscal Q2. This includes the design win with the Volkswagen Group's software company, CARIAD, to power Volkswagen's future automated driving solutions. In consumer IoT, we continue to execute on our opportunities across tablets, XR, PCs and smart consumer devices.\nFor personal computing, we are continuing to drive the inevitable transition to ARM. We are on track to deliver Windows on Snapdragon compute platforms for next-generation PCs powered by our custom CPUs while redefining mobile productivity and on-device AI. To support the accelerating transition to ARM-based computing, Microsoft recently announced Project Volterra, a new developer kit powered by the Snapdragon compute platform featuring the Qualcomm AI engine.\nThey also announced a comprehensive end-to-end ARM native tool chain for Windows application developers including Visual Studio, Visual C++, [Darknet] and more. In edge networking, we launched 4 new Networking Pro Series Wi-Fi 7 platforms, the world's most scalable Wi-Fi 7 portfolio, initiating a new era of 10 gigabits per second Wi-Fi for enterprise access points, Wi-Fi mesh, carrier gateways and premium home routers.\nWe also continue to see strong momentum in industrial IoT and recently announced 2 new 5G connected robotics platforms with enhanced AI capabilities, computer vision, 5G connectivity and a comprehensive customizable SDK to power next-generation robotics and drones, including autonomous mobile robots, AMRs, highly automated manufacturing robots and more.\nThese achievements demonstrate our ability to continue to grow across automotive in the broader IoT categories in addition to our RF front-end and handsets. Our one technology road map is the cornerstone of the strategy with unparalleled leadership across not one, but multiple technologies required for the connected intelligent edge.\nThis includes on-device AI, low-power, high-performance compute, computer vision, advanced connectivity and more. Importantly, as we expand into new growth areas, we're driving our technologies to meet the highest performance requirement for each application and serve as the industry design point. For example, our dedicated automotive SoCs and accelerators for Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving can deliver up to 700 trillion operations per second tops of AI processing.\nOur RB6 robotics platform brings advanced edge AI and video processing capabilities support for up to 7 concurrent cameras and up to 200 tops, and we believe our upcoming custom-designed CPUs will redefine computing performance for Windows PCs.\nOf particular note is our significant momentum in AI. We recently launched the Qualcomm AI Stack, which unifies our existing best-in-class AI software solutions into a single package that works across all Qualcomm platforms. The Qualcomm AI Stack is positioned to become the platform for AI at the edge. The Qualcomm AI Stack supports all AI frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch and ONNX as well as AI runtimes such as TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow Lite Micro and ONNX Runtime.\nWe also have a rich variety of OS support, including Android, Windows, Linux, QNX, Ubuntu and others. With this new offering, OEMs and developers can now develop and optimize AI models once then move the same model across different Qualcomm products and tiers for true \"develop once, deploy anywhere\" model.\nWe believe the Qualcomm AI Stack portfolio is a revolutionary step in scaling high-performance, low-power on-device AI processing. These solutions demonstrate how our one technology road map is transforming Qualcomm from a wireless communications company for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge.\nLastly, as we continue to move forward and execute on our strategy, we're mindful of the challenging economic environment, and we remain disciplined on investments that drive sustainable differentiation and stockholder value. We are focused on customers and industries that drive stable long-term growth.\nWe believe the industry trends that are driving demand for our technologies remain unchanged and continue to validate our strategy, positioning us well for the long term. We're still on track to expand our addressable market by more than 7x to approximately $700 billion in the next decade.\nBefore I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to invite you to join us in New York on September 22 at our first-ever Automotive Investor Day event. Qualcomm is the leading automotive technology platform provider for next-generation vehicles. We will demonstrate how the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is enabling the transformation of the automobile and continuing to drive growth in our design win pipeline.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\n\nAkash Palkhiwala\n\nChief Finance Officer, Qualcomm Incorporated\n\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results in our third fiscal quarter despite the impact of the challenging economic environment. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $10.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.96, which was above the high end of our guidance.\nNon-GAAP revenues and EPS grew by 37% and 54%, respectively, versus the year ago quarter, driven by technology leadership, revenue diversification and operating efficiency. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 71% were at the midpoint of guidance. These results reflect a decrease in handset volume in mid- and low tiers offset by favorable mix. QCT recorded revenues of $9.4 billion and EBT margin of 32%, both at the midpoint of our guidance and reflecting revenue growth of 45% and EBT dollar growth of 67% versus the year ago quarter.\nHandset revenues of $6.1 billion increased 59% year-over-year driven by the strength of our Snapdragon product portfolio, especially in the premium and high tiers. Consistent with our guidance, RF front-end revenues of $1 billion, grew 9% versus the year ago quarter on increased adoption of our broad product portfolio.\nIoT revenues were up 31% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. We saw strong performance across Edge networking and industrial IoT with combined revenue growth of more than 40%. We delivered another record quarter in automotive with revenues of $350 million with year-over-year growth of 38% driven by launches with our digital cockpit products.\nLooking forward to global 3G, 4G, 5G handset forecast. We now expect calendar '22 global handsets to decrease by mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis, including 650 million to 700 million 5G handsets. Our guidance reflects the continuation of the trends that adversely impacted handset volumes exiting the June quarter.\nWe expect the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and the impact of COVID measures in China will cause customers to act with caution in managing their purchases in the second half of calendar '22. In the fourth fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $11 billion to $11.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3 to $3.30. The midpoint of our guidance includes an estimated impact of approximately $0.20 due to the macroeconomic headwinds and the reduction in the global handset forecast I just outlined.\nWe are forecasting QTL revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%, reflecting normal sequential unit growth. In QCT, we expect revenues of $9.5 billion to $10.1 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 27% and EBT dollar growth of 31%.\nOn a sequential basis, we expect growth across QCT handset and automotive revenue streams. In handsets, while Snapdragon premium tier volume remains resilient, our guidance assumes lower demand in other tiers, reflecting the updated global handset forecast.\nIn IoT, we are seeing strength across industrial and enterprise, which is offset by pockets of weakness in consumer products. We anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 6% to 8% sequentially, with approximately half of the growth due to the inclusion of 2 quarters of expenses for the Arriver acquisition.\nAs a reminder, our third quarter results did not include Arriver since we are reporting 1 quarter in arrears until the fourth fiscal quarter. Based on the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, we're expecting fiscal '22 to be an exceptional year.\nWe expect non-GAAP EPS of $12.55, a growth of $4 relative to fiscal '21. We are forecasting QCT revenues of greater than $37 billion, a year-over-year growth of greater than $10 billion and EBT margin expansion of approximately 5 points. QCT handset revenues are on track to grow slightly below 50% relative to fiscal '21, driven by increased processor content and expansion of our addressable market. With our continued focus on diversification, we are forecasting RF front-end IoT and automotive combined revenues of greater than $12 billion in fiscal '22.\nLastly, we are pleased to announce we signed a long-term extension of our license agreement with Samsung through 2030 at the same royalty terms. With this agreement, the QTL forecast that we provided at Investor Day remains unchanged.\nIn closing, while we are mindful of the current environment, our long-term fundamentals are intact. We remain focused on driving growth by executing on our vision to bring cloud connectivity, data processing and artificial intelligence to the edge. Thank you, and back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Qualcomm Incorporated\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

We're extremely pleased to report strong second quarter results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $11.2 billion, our third consecutive quarter of record revenues and non-GAAP EPS of $3.21. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 41% and 69%, respectively, driven by strength across all QCT revenue streams.\nQTL revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margin of 73% were above the midpoint of guidance, reflecting a slight decrease in lower-tier units, offset by a favorable mix. This was another record quarter for QCT with revenues of $9.5 billion and EBT of $3.3 billion, an increase of 52% and 111%, respectively, versus the year ago quarter.\nWe have now doubled QCT EBT dollars on a year-over-year basis in 6 of the last 7 quarters. Additionally, QCT EBT margin of 35% surpassed the high end of our guidance and increased 10 points year-over-year driven by revenue growth and diversification. Handset revenues of $6.3 billion increased 56% versus a year ago quarter. The upside relative to guidance was driven by increased volume in premium tier and improved supply. We gained share in Samsung's flagship device, the Galaxy S22, demonstrating leadership of our Snapdragon processor technology and our ability to compete with internal chipset initiatives.\nRF front-end revenues of $1.2 billion grew 28% versus the year ago quarter on increased adoption of our products across major OEMs. We saw accelerated growth across IoT and automotive as we align supply to better meet the demand for our products.\nIoT revenues were up 61% year-over-year to $1.7 billion primarily on increased demand for our chipsets for connected intelligent edge devices. We saw strong performance across consumer, edge networking and industrial with each of these categories growing by more than 50% compared to the year ago quarter.\nWe achieved record automotive revenues of $339 million, a growth of 41% versus the year ago period, driven by launches with our digital cockpit platforms. With the strong adoption of our Snapdragon digital chassis, we have now increased our overall design win pipeline to greater than $16 billion.\nLastly, during the quarter, we announced a 10% increase in our dividends and returned $1.7 billion in dividends and stock repurchases. Our strong free cash flow has positioned us to deliver attractive capital returns that are among the highest in the semiconductor industry while maintaining flexibility for strategic investments.\nBefore turning to guidance, I will provide an update on the Arriver acquisition. On April 1, SSW Partners acquired Veoneer for $4.6 billion with substantially all of it funded by Qualcomm. SSW Partners then transferred Arriver to Qualcomm and now plans to sell the remaining non-Arriver businesses over the next several quarters.\nWe expect that Qualcomm will receive most of the cash proceeds from the sale. We estimate Arriver non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $50 million per quarter. However, our guidance for the third fiscal quarter does not include this impact since we plan to report Arriver 1 quarter in arrears until the fourth quarter. Further details of the transaction are included in our 10-Q and earnings presentation posted on our Investor Relations website.\nTurning to financial guidance for the third fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $10.5 billion to $11.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.75 to $2.95. We estimate QTL revenues of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%. Our guidance contemplates global handset units consistent with the exit rate from the second fiscal quarter and assumes the end of COVID-related impact in China by the end of the quarter.\nIn QCT, we estimate revenues of $9.1 billion to $9.6 billion and EBT margins of 31% to 33%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 44% and EBT dollar growth of $1.2 billion. On a sequential basis, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth in IoT and automotive and a seasonal reduction in handsets and RF front end.\nOur strong forecast for QCT is driven by the same factors which benefited our second quarter, including gains in handset premium tier volume, strong demand in IoT and automotive and supply improvements. We anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 5% to 7% sequentially, reflecting select investments in product road map.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our financial results and strong execution as we manage to supply constraints in the current macroeconomic environment. Our QCT handset revenues are on track to grow by greater than 50% in fiscal '22. And we are well positioned for fiscal '23 as we continue to benefit from increased processor content and share gains.\nWhile we strengthen our mobile leadership, diversification is the top priority for the company as evidenced by increasing design win pipeline in automotive and accelerating revenue growth in IoT.\nThank you. Back to you, Mauricio.\n\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Qualcomm Incorporated\n\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

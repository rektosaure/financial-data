[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Dan Connally, Head of Investor Relations at Intuitive. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDan Connally\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Dave Rosa, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent 10-K filed on January 31, 2025, and Form 10-Q filed on July 23, 2025.\nOur SEC filings can be found through our website at intuitive.com or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website in the Events section under our Investor Relations page. We have posted today's press release and supplementary financial data tables to our website.\nOur format for this afternoon's earnings conference call is as follows: Dave will review business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results and procedure highlights. I will review clinical highlights and discuss our updated financial outlook for 2025. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid J. Rosa\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2025 was an excellent quarter for Intuitive, with strength in worldwide procedure growth and capital placements as well as increasing utilization across all platforms. Globally customer interest in and adoption of da Vinci 5 expanded. Domestically, customers responded to our first full quarter of broad da Vinci 5 availability with increased demand for system upgrades and dual consoles.\nInternationally, we placed our first systems in Japan and Europe with surgeons performing initial cases in those geographies. Turning to procedures. Da Vinci procedures increased by 19% and Ion procedures were higher by 52%, leading to total worldwide procedure growth of 20%. Da Vinci procedure growth reflected strength in benign general surgery in the U.S. and accretive growth in general surgery and gynecology internationally.\nSystem utilization defined as procedures for installed clinical system per quarter grew 4% for our da Vinci multi-port platforms, 35% for SP and 14% for Ion. In the first 18 months since launch, da Vinci utilization is validating our design intent already outpacing Xi. Procedure demand has been healthy. And as da Vinci [ catalyzed ] upgrades, we saw the multiport installed base utilization ticking up to absorb that demand. This is healthy for our customers and for our company.\nTurning to capital. We placed 427 da Vinci systems, including 240 da Vinci 5 systems and 30 SP systems as well as 50 Ion systems. Demand for da Vinci 5 upgrades drove strong domestic placements. We believe upgrades are an effective way for customers to expand throughput and capabilities. These capabilities include [ force ] sensing, surgeon autonomy, telepresence and various other digital tools that may lead to enhanced understanding of what great surgery looks like and further adoption of robotic-assisted surgery over time.\nAdditionally, it is our intent to offer refurbished Xi Systems as part of our broader portfolio, which will help expand access in certain geographies and sites of care. Internationally, da Vinci placements reflected ongoing external dynamics in Japan, China and the U.K., offset by broad-based strength in other international markets. Customer adoption of our products resulted in strong financial performance reflected in 23% revenue growth and combined with strong operating discipline, 30% earnings growth.\nJamie will provide further details on procedures, systems and finances later in the call. Last month, we hosted our tenth Annual Intuitive 360 User Conference in San Diego, where more than 1,100 health care professionals representing over 450 institutions from around the world gathered to exchange ideas and shape the future of patient care. Customers remained acutely focused on improving patient outcomes, reducing clinical and operational variation, driving efficiency and increasing access to minimally invasive care. More than 30 institutions presented their own clinical and financial outcomes data, which further validated the value of our 3 existing platforms.\nI have the opportunity to sit down with multiple customers and dive deep into their robotic programs, including the impact of da Vinci 5 and potential fleet standardization, site of care dynamics and their overall lung cancer programs. I was encouraged to see the depth of their data and analyses and how these customers were able to quantify the impact of their Intuitive programs on aspects of the Quintuple Aim.\nDomestically, while we remain in limited launch with force feedback instrumentation, we are working closely with customers to support their analysis of the impact of force feedback on clinical outcomes and learning progression. I am encouraged by early feedback and excited to see where some of these studies are leading. Dan will highlight some of this data later in the call. Across all of our platforms, we consistently upgrade capability and reliability through software and hardware releases. In Q3, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the first in a series of software updates for da Vinci 5. With the addition of network central configuration management, we are now able to deploy updates remotely, which significantly streamlines workflow for both our customers and Intuitive. This release also includes the visual representation of force through force gauge and focus mode, which enables in-console video replay and viewing registration and manipulation of 3D models.\nThese features enhance surgeon awareness and intraoperative decision-making. You will see us continue to make improvements to the platform that advance our vision of delivering real-time insights at the point of care to support clinical efficiency with the aim of improving outcomes. Internationally, we placed our first 9 systems in Japan and Europe and have received positive early feedback. We look forward to engaging customers as they continue to evaluate da Vinci 5.\nOur da Vinci single port platform made further progress in Q3. Procedures increased 91%, led by ongoing growth in Korea, continued early progress in other international markets and initial domestic use of the SP stapler in colorectal and thoracic procedures. At 360, I had a conversation with a long-time da Vinci thoracic surgeon about his initial experience using SP on about 40 patients. He's enthusiastic both about the reduction and length of stay and also his first few cases of using the SP stapler. I share his enthusiasm about these early results and look forward to seeing more data from colorectal and thoracic procedures as our launch progresses.\nRecent 510(k) clearances support several advanced features, including sensitive Firefly and various control algorithms aimed at further improving SP stapler usability. Since we last spoke with you on our Q2 call, we have completed U.S. regulatory submissions for nipple-sparing mastectomy and other general surgery procedures. We look forward to updating you on these efforts on future calls. Turning to Ion. Worldwide procedures grew 52% to just under 38,000. We are now delivering Ion's differentiated value at scale, providing precise and individualized patient-specific navigation plans using AI to segment each CT scan and planned a biopsy trajectory.\nThis quarter, we received FDA clearance for a significant software release that improves workflow and imaging options, including upgraded system software that uses real-time AI to enable even more precise airway navigation and tomosynthesis integration, broadening the suite of imaging offerings when cone-beam CT is not available.\nIn closing, we are committed to our 2025 priorities. First, focusing on the full launch of da Vinci 5, its regional clearances and follow-on feature releases. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption of our focused procedures by country through training, commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we'll drive continued progress in building industrial scale product quality and manufacturing optimization. And finally, we'll focus on excellence and availability of our digital tools.\nLooking ahead, by virtue of our focus on patients, our alignment with customers in pursuit of the Quintuple Aim, our investments in both industrial scale and innovation and our commercial excellence, we are well positioned operationally and financially to further increase value to patients, physicians, hospitals and payers globally. With that, I'll turn the time over to Jamie to take you through our business and finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nVP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will begin by highlighting our third quarter performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, and I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is available on our website. The third quarter was a strong quarter for Intuitive.\nTaken Da Vinci and Ion together, total procedure growth was 20% compared to 18% growth for the first half of 2025. In quarter 3, revenue grew 23% to $2.5 billion, pro forma operating margin was 39% and pro forma earnings per share increased 30%. The strength of our financial results reflected the broad launch of da Vinci 5 and expanded adoption of our Ion and SP platforms. For our da Vinci business, procedures grew 19%, the installed base of da Vinci systems increased by 13% to almost 10,800 systems and average system utilization increased by 4%.\nWe continue to see robust growth for our Ion platform with procedures increasing 52%, the installed base up by 30% to approximately 950 systems and average system utilization increasing by 14%. In the U.S. total procedures, da Vinci and Ion increased 18%, reflecting 16% growth in da Vinci procedures and 48% growth in Ion procedures. Da Vinci utilization in the U.S. increased 2% in Q3 compared to flat utilization in the first half of this year and 2% growth last year.\nIncreased growth in U.S. da Vinci utilization reflected strong Q3 procedure growth and the higher mix of da Vinci 5 in the installed base, where utilization is higher than Xi. This reflects surgeon interest in using our latest technology and efficiency gains from Da Vinci 5's higher levels of surge in autonomy and integration. As one example, in quarter 3, almost 90% of da Vinci procedures used our integrated insufflation technology. Outside the U.S., total procedures da Vinci and Ion grew 25% driven by 24% growth in da Vinci procedures and a quadrupling of Ion procedures from a small base.\nOUS procedure growth reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit as a result of the timing of certain local holidays. Da Vinci procedure growth in OUS markets included strong results in India, Canada, Korea, Taiwan and Brazil, and solid growth in China, the U.K., Italy and France. Procedure growth in Japan was a little lower than our expectations, reflecting lower capital placements over the last several quarters.\nGlobally, we continue to see strong procedure growth for SP at 91% for Q3, with strength in Korea and earlier stage growth in Europe and Japan. In total, for our OUS markets, we saw accretive da Vinci procedure growth across benign general surgery, up 39%; colorectal, up 28%; hysterectomy, which grew 27%; and thoracic procedures, which increased 26%. Combined, those categories are approximately 40% of OUS da Vinci procedures.\nAverage system utilization in OUS markets combined grew 8% in Q3 as compared to 6% in the first half of this year and 4% growth in 2024. Accelerating utilization in Q3 is driven by strong multi-specialty procedure growth in India, Korea, Taiwan and distributor markets and customers in countries with capital constraints, driving increasing use of the existing installed base. As of Q3, aggregate average system utilization in OUS markets is approximately 20% below that systems in the U.S.\nAs a result of our clinical performance, total I&A revenue in quarter 3 grew 20% to $1.5 billion, consistent with overall procedure growth. Da Vinci I&A revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, flat with last quarter and last year. On a year-over-year basis, we saw downward pressure from lower bariatric procedures and higher cholecystectomy procedures, offset by higher SP procedures and Da Vinci 5 specific I&A. For our ion platform, I&A revenue per procedure was approximately $2,200 relatively consistent with prior periods.\nTurning to capital performance and starting with our da Vinci business. We placed 427 da Vinci systems in quarter 3, a 13% increase from the 379 systems placed in the same quarter last year. 240 of the 427 placements were da Vinci 5, including 12 in OUS markets following recent clearances in Japan and Europe. The installed base of Da Vinci 5 is now 929 systems. In the U.S., we have at least 1 da Vinci 5 system in 18 of the largest 20 [ IDNs ]. And of hospitals that have 3 or more multiport systems, 21 of those hospitals have fully standardized to da Vinci 5.\nWe saw 141 [ trading ] transactions in Q3, up from 38 a year ago, primarily driven by U.S. customers upgrading to da Vinci 5. Some customers are shifting budgets to upgrades, partly with the intention of taking advantage or the efficiency potential of da Vinci 5. We are also actively working with some customers to acquire da Vinci 5 and move their Xis to alternative sites within their network.\nIn the U.S., we placed 263 systems, up from 219 last year, driven by demand for da Vinci 5. Outside the U.S., we placed 164 systems compared to 160 last year. Our U.S. placements included 63 systems in Europe, 16 in Japan and 13 in China compared to 65, 39 and 14, respectively, last year. We continue to see government budget challenges in Japan and the U.K. and the constrained and competitive marketplace in China.\nPerformance in markets served by distributors continue to be relatively strong. In Q3, we placed 64 systems compared to 52 systems last year. Q3 performance was driven by strength in Brazil and the Middle East. Within the 427 da Vinci placements, we placed 30 SP systems in the third quarter, higher than the 21 systems last year driven primarily by OUS markets. For our Ion platform, we based 50 systems in the quarter compared to 58 systems last year.\nQ3 Ion placements included 9 systems in OUS markets. Lower Ion placements in the U.S. primarily reflects a joint focus with our customers on increasing utilization. As a function of our capital performance, quarter 3 systems revenue grew 33% to $590 million. For our da Vinci business, leasing represented 54% of da Vinci placements as compared to 49% last quarter and 58% last year, driven primarily by customer mix.\nWe continue to expect that rates of leasing will increase over time, primarily driven by OUS markets. Da Vinci leasing revenue increased 33%, reflecting an 18% expansion of the installed base under operating lease arrangements and a 10% increase in lease revenue per system driven by a higher mix of da Vinci 5. The average selling price for purchased da Vinci Systems was $1.6 million in Q3 as compared to $1.5 million last year, driven by a higher mix of da Vinci 5 and the higher mix of dual console systems, partially offset by higher trade-ins.\nLease buyout revenue was $22 million as compared to $30 million last quarter and $24 million last year. Quarter 3 service revenue increased 20% to $396 million, reflecting an increase of the da Vinci installed base of 13% and the Ion installed base of 30%. Service revenue per system for our da Vinci installed base increased 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a higher mix of da Vinci 5 systems.\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $2.51 billion representing 23% growth over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 23%. Recurring revenue grew 21% continuing to account for 85% of total revenue. Turning now to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 68%, down from 69.1% in Q3 of last year.\nThe year-over-year decline reflects a 90 basis point impact from tariffs, higher facility costs, a greater mix of lower margin da Vinci 5 and Ion revenue and higher service costs related to da Vinci, partially offset by cost reductions. Quarter 3 pro forma operating expenses increased 11% year-over-year, driven by higher headcount, increased facility costs and higher R&D prototype expenses, partially offset by lower legal spending.\nWe added approximately 340 employees during the quarter, primarily in our core commercial, engineering and manufacturing functions. As a reminder, we are planning to go direct in Italy, Spain and Portugal in the first half of next year. This will involve the transfer of approximately 250 employees. We expect to describe the impact of this in greater detail at our next earnings call.\nPro forma other income was $93 million for the quarter, flat to the prior quarter, reflecting lower interest income, offset by a lower FX impact from remeasurement of the balance sheet. Our pro forma effective tax rate for quarter 3 was 18.3% lower than our expectations, reflecting the impact of the new U.S. tax provisions for the treatment of R&D expenses and a $16 million discrete benefit from the release of tax reserves associated with statute of limitation expiration.\nWe are still evaluating potential impacts of U.S. tax reform for our 2026 tax rate. Pro forma net income for the third quarter was $867 million compared with $669 million last year. Pro forma earnings per share was $2.40 per share. Excluding the benefit of tax expense in Q3 from the U.S. tax reform and the release of tax reserve, pro forma EPS would have been $2.28 per share.\nNow turning to our GAAP results. GAAP net income for the quarter was $704 million or $1.95 per share compared to $565 million or $1.56 per share in Q3 of last year. The differences between our pro forma and GAAP results are outlined and quantified on our website. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion in cash and investments, down from $9.5 billion last quarter.\nIn line with our capital allocation priorities, during the quarter, we used $1.9 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 4 million of Intuitive shares. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflects the stock repurchases, partially offset by strong free cash flow of $736 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Dan to discuss recent clinical publications and our updated outlook for 2025.\n\nDan Connally\n\nThank you, Jamie. Turning to the clinical side of our business. I'd like to share with you data from several notable recent studies. In addition to the specific data highlighted on this call, we encourage you to consider the wide body of evidence detailing these topics and others and published scientific studies over the years. Last month, at the European Respiratory Society's Annual Conference, we saw continued growth in evidence describing the Ion and [indiscernible] systems impact in geographies outside the United States.\nAt the conference, Dr. Carolin Steinack from University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland presented an abstract that detailed results from an open-label randomized controlled trial that compared Ion plus integrated mobile cone beam CT to conventional bronchoscopy. Conducted at University Hospitals Zurich, this study compared outcomes from pulmonary nodule biopsies performed in 78 patients with 39 patients in each group. Median nodule size was just 11 millimeters in each group.\nResults demonstrated an increase in diagnostic yield between the 2 groups in excess of 60 percentage points with the Ion Group at 84.6% and the conventional bronchoscopy group at 23.1%. Procedure times and complication rates in both groups were comparable. Additionally, in the same presentation, the group showed a center-wide increase in early-stage cancer diagnosis after implementation of the integrated Ion and mobile cone beam CT system with an increase of Stage 1a non-small cell lung cancer diagnosis of approximately 30 percentage points.\nDr. Steinack concluded, even with minimal training, Ion robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with integrated cone-beam CT is a pivotal tool for effective early lung cancer diagnosis and a potential driver of a shift towards early-stage diagnosis. On previous calls, we have shared published studies that describe the impact of Force Feedback technology across multiple specialties.\nIn September, Dr. Peter Kneuertz from the Ohio State University in collaboration with other thoracic surgeons and Intuitive published Force in robotic thoracic surgery, a 1-year analysis of da Vinci 5 Force Feedback in the Journal of Robotic Surgery. To date, the inability for surgeons to [ feel force ] exerted in the operative field has been a meaningful limitation of robotic-assisted thoracic surgery. This study incorporated data from over 400 common thoracic procedures performed by 70 surgeons with da Vinci 5 and Force Feedback technology. The analysis showed that median instrument [ tip forces ] decreased stepwise based on Force Feedback sensitivity setting across all procedures.\nMoreover, there was a significant difference in the amount of time at peak force greater than 6.5 newtons across Force Feedback settings with a reduction of approximately 20% in peak force application when Force Feedback instruments were set to medium or high. The authors noted that this study provides clinical evidence that Force Feedback technology may help reduce force during robotic-assisted thoracic surgery and result in objectively gentler surgery. The first step in evaluating the impact of Force Feedback is to see an intraoperative difference in applied force.\nHere, we are encouraged by early results across specialties on the value that we believe Force Feedback technology brings to patients and surgeons. The next step in evaluating the impact of force Feedback is to assess whether changes in forces applied during surgery translate to the patient experience on measures like pain or other functional patient outcomes. These studies are underway, and we look forward to their publication and discussion in the coming quarters and years.\nI will now turn to our updated financial guidance for 2025. Starting with da Vinci procedure growth. On our last call, we forecast full year 2025 da Vinci procedure growth within a range of 15.5% and 17%. We are updating our 2025 da Vinci procedure growth guidance to be within a range of 17% and 17.5%.\nTurning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast pro forma gross profit margin in 2025 to be within a range of 66% and 67% of revenue. Given Q3 results, which reflected greater leverage of fixed costs and benefits from cost reductions as well as a lower expected tariff impact for the year, we are updating our estimate of pro forma gross margin to be within a range of 67% and 67.5% of revenue. Within that range, we now expect the impact of tariffs for the year to be 70 basis points, plus or minus 10 basis points.\nWe expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 13%, which includes increased depreciation from new facilities and investments to drive our growth objectives. We estimate noncash stock compensation expense to be between $785 million and $795 million. We forecast other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $350 million and $360 million. We expect capital expenditures to range between $625 million and $675 million, which reflects planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, due primarily to the lower Q3 non-GAAP effective tax rate that Jamie described earlier, we now estimate our 2025 pro forma income tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. This concludes our prepared comments. As we open the line for questions, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 or 2 questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Dan Connolly, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Dave Rosa, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent 10-K filed on January 31, 2025, and Form 10-Q filed on April 23, 2025. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page.\nToday's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Dave will review business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results and procedure highlights. I will review clinical highlights and discuss our updated financial outlook for 2025. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid J. Rosa\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before we proceed, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Gary Goodheart. As you know, after more than 15 years as Intuitive CEO, Gary transitioned to Executive Chair of the Board earlier this month. It's been a privilege to work alongside Gary for nearly 30 years. We joined within a month of each other as engineers at what was a tiny California-based company in 1996, where a small group of us developed the first da Vinci prototype. Since then, we have worked together with many extraordinary colleagues to build a company that is today a global enterprise, employing more than 16,000 people, supporting over 11,000 robotic systems across 74 countries, with over 17 million procedures performed. On behalf of the patients, surgeons and care teams we support, our employees and so many other stakeholders, we thank Gary for his leadership at Intuitive and his contributions to advancing minimally invasive care. I am grateful for the strong foundation he's created and honored to serve as Intuitive's next CEO. I'm excited to lead the company forward as we continue to advance the Quintuple Aim and deliver value for our stakeholders.\nMoving to the business. Our financial metrics were strong in the second quarter with solid procedure growth in capital placements despite ongoing macro challenges in certain international markets. Our teams achieved significant milestones across our ecosystem of products and services while navigating dynamic market conditions globally. Our product operations teams continue to build capacity and deliver for our customers while optimizing production costs within our existing manufacturing and supply chain footprint. Our research and development efforts continued to build momentum in the quarter. Our newest platform, da Vinci 5, is in broad launch in the United States and received clearances in Europe and Japan, where we will begin measured launches. We are pleased with customer feedback and adoption of our newer platforms and remain committed to supporting high-quality, minimally invasive care with a comprehensive and impactful product portfolio. Reviewing procedure performance. DaVinci procedure growth in the quarter was 17%. And benign general surgery led U.S. procedure growth with a strong contribution from after hours procedures, while international growth was led by non-urology procedures. Regional performance highlights included strength in India, Korea and distribution markets. Jamie will provide further details on procedure dynamics later in the call.\nTurning to capital. We placed 395 da Vinci systems including 180 da Vinci 5 systems and 23 SP systems. Capital placements were strong in the U.S., while macro challenges in Japan, China and Europe continued. We also placed 54 Ion systems in the quarter. System utilization defined as procedures for installed clinical system per quarter grew 2% year-over-year for our multiport platforms, and accelerated to 30% and 8% for SP and Ion, respectively.\nMoving to our finances. Revenue growth of 21% reflects solid procedure performance and capital placements, and a benefit from higher purchase mix. Product margins and operating expenses were slightly favorable to our expectations. Turning to our multiport business. Da Vinci 5 has been an important addition to our robotic surgical system portfolio with more than 100,000 procedures performed to date in what had been a measured U.S. launch. We are pleased to offer da Vinci 5 broadly in the United States. Commercialization in Europe and Japan will be measured as we work through additional clearances to fully enable the da Vinci 5 ecosystem. We also added to our advanced energy instrument portfolio with 510(k) clearance for vessel sealer curved, giving surgeons greater precision in narrow anatomical spaces. Additionally, we received a procedure clearance for tracheal bronchoplasty, a surgical treatment for a collapsed trachea and main bronchi during normal breathing.\nWith respect to our digital ecosystem, Customers continue to collect and publish data about force feedback and other aspects of da Vinci 5 through their use of case insights. Dan will highlight some of this data later in the call. Since launching dual console capability with da Vinci Si in 2009, we have developed a range of digital collaboration tools for our customers. We believe these tele-collaboration capabilities can advance clinician training enhance patient care and optimize care delivery. Intuitive telepresence with our latest hub software will enable customers to use on-demand scheduling, connecting easily with a known group of peers similar to the favorite screen on your phone. Last week, at the Society of Robotic Surgery Conference, Dr. Doug Stoddard, Director of Surgery and Robotics at Christus Health and Dr. Andrea Pakula, Medical Director of Robotic Surgery at Adventist Health performed a telesurgery demonstration between Atlanta and Strasburg on an advanced tissue model using da Vinci 5, including force feedback. While the long-term opportunity for TELUS surgery is potentially significant, we recognize that achieving safe, consistent adoption will require robust cybersecurity and privacy infrastructure, new workflows at hospitals, revised medical and legal policies and appropriate business economics. As with our approach to innovation broadly, our work here is focused on applying our experience and expertise to deliver safe, meaningful grounded solutions that address real-world health care challenges.\nTurning to procedure growth was strong at 88% year-over-year, with growth accelerating in Korea. We are still early in our European launch and are pleased with progress to date. Our SP team achieved several milestones, including receiving clearance for our 50 use endoscope, along with 510(k) clearance for transanal local excision and resection, adding to a suite of transabdominal colorectal procedures. Our priorities for SP in the near term include additional indications in the U.S., expansion in international markets, enhancing core capability and improving product costs.\nMoving to Ion. Procedures grew 52% to approximately 35,000 in the quarter. We recently sold our first systems in Australia and Korea and performed our first commercial procedures. Our priorities for Ion in the near term are supporting utilization growth in the U.S., expansion in international markets, enhancing overall procedure workflow and improving product costs. Over recent years, we have highlighted our investments in and focus on delivering for our customers across all aspects of our ecosystem at industrial scale. Customers around the globe rely on intuitive for high-quality products and services. had rock-solid supply continuity to ensure they can serve their patients safely, reliably and effectively had volumes approaching 3 million patients per year globally. As has been the case throughout our 30-year history, we will continue to innovate across our instrument portfolio as illustrated by the introduction of our force feedback and extended use instrumentation. Our work here is guided by a commitment to the Quintuple AI'm, including patient safety, product quality and reliability and informed by data from millions of procedures.\nWe are aware that third parties have sought to offer products or services to health care providers that would modify some of our instruments to extend their use. As customers consider remanufactured instruments from third-party suppliers, we expect key areas such as safety, performance, quality, reliability supply continuity and pricing will be carefully evaluated and compared. Our strong belief is that high-quality instruments with consistent performance, broad operational support and predictable supply chains provide the greatest value to our customers. In closing, we are committed to our 2025 priorities. First, focusing on the full launch of da Vinci 5, its regional clearances and follow-on feature releases. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for our focused procedures by country through training, commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we'll drive continued progress in building industrial scale, product quality and manufacturing optimization. And finally, we'll focus on excellence and availability of our digital tools. Our core businesses have momentum, and our teams are focused on the significant long-term opportunity to improve the Quintuple Aim through our connected ecosystem. We are well positioned operationally and financially to execute against our priorities.\nI'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nVP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will begin by highlighting our second quarter performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, and I will summarize our GAAP results later in my remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is available on our website. Our second quarter financial results were strong.\nRevenue growth was 21%. Pro forma operating margin was 39% and pro forma earnings per share increased 23%. Our underlying core metrics were solid and as follows: da Vinci procedures grew 17%. Our installed base of da Vinci systems increased 14% to almost 10,500 systems globally and average system utilization rose by 2%, taking da Vinci and Ion together, total procedure growth was 18%. Strength in Q2 financial results reflected a higher mix of systems purchased by customers as compared to last quarter and last year and leverage of fixed costs. In the U.S., da Vinci procedures grew 14%, driven by continued strength in benign general surgery with notable growth in cholecystectomy and appendectomy, reflecting, in part, our partnership with customers to support growth in after hours procedures. When considering the environment in the U.S. We recognize the potential impacts of fiscal policy to Medicaid recipients. There are approximately 70 million to 80 million Americans covered through this program, for which uncertainty remains about whether some patients may lose coverage, how that plays through health systems and what the ultimate impact might be. At this point, I would highlight the following: First, currently Intuitive's relative penetration is lower for patients covered by Medicaid as compared to all other types of coverage. Second, Medicaid patients tend to be a younger demographic as compared to the overall population. And third, to the extent that Intuitive can demonstrate an advantage clinically and economically we believe we are in a position of relative strength. Outside the U.S., da Vinci procedures grew 23%, with strong contributions from India, Korea and distributor markets. Clinical performance in India has been driven by expansion of the installed base at greenfield accounts and adoption by surgeons across a broad set of surgical specialties.\nStrength in Korea procedure growth partly reflected a weaker comparison period given the impact of physician strikes last year. We also continue to see strong adoption and use of SP in Korea across a broad set of procedures. In China, procedure growth slightly exceeded the global average and continues to reflect the impact of a constrained and a competitive capital environment. Overall, outside the U.S., we observed robust growth across colorectal, benign general surgery, drastic, kidney and HPB procedures. The breadth of OUS procedure growth reflects our focus in supporting customer adoption beyond geology and is an ongoing opportunity for Intuitive to reach more patients.\nTurning to capital performance. We placed 395 systems in quarter 2, a 16% increase from the 341 systems placed in the same quarter last year. Following our progression into U.S. broad launch of da Vinci 5 during Q2, we placed 180 da Vinci 5 systems, bringing the installed base to 689 systems. We saw 83 trading transactions in Q2, up from 21% a year ago, primarily driven by U.S. customers upgrading to da Vinci 5. While there are a number of customers expressing interest in upgrading to da Vinci 5, we expect trade-ins to occur over multiple years as customers assess its clinical and financial benefits. In the U.S., we placed 216 systems, up from 149 last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 179 systems compared to 192 last year. OUS placements included 73 systems in Europe, 15 in Japan and 13 in China compared to 71, 41 and 14, respectively, last year. Performance in markets served by distributors has been strong in recent periods. In Q2, we placed 79 systems compared to 70 systems last year. Recent strength has been driven by growth in Brazil Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, reflecting expansion into customers, establishing their first robotic programs. Our capital performance outside the U.S. continues to be impacted by ongoing financial and budgetary pressures in Japan, China and Europe. These pressures reflect government budget challenges and uncertainties over the trade environment. During the quarter, NHS England issued its 10-year plan to improve health care outcomes and associated priorities. We are encouraged to see a commitment to expanding access to robotic surgery as one of the key elements of the plan. However, we do not expect any positive impact this year from incremental NHS investments in robotics.\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $2.44 billion, representing 21% growth over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 21%. And Systems revenue increased 28%, reflecting lower lease rates, increased placements and a higher mix of da Vinci 5 systems, which drove higher average selling prices. Recurring revenue also grew 21% and accounted for 85% of total revenue. Leasing represented 49% of Q2 placements, lower than 54% last year primarily driven by a higher mix of placements with distributors, most of whom do not qualify to lease systems. While leasing rates may vary from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect a trend towards leasing to increase over time, driven primarily by a higher mix of leasing by OUS customers. The average selling price for systems was $1.5 million compared to $1.44 million last year. reflecting the increasing mix of da Vinci 5 systems, partially offset by a higher mix of trade-in transactions. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800 relatively consistent with the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a downward pressure from lower bariatric procedures and higher cholecystectomy procedures, offset by customer ordering patterns higher SP procedures and da Vinci 5 specific INA. Second quarter SP procedures grew 88%, driven by 112% growth in Korea and strong growth in Europe and Japan. We placed 23 SP systems in Q2 compared to 21 systems last year. These included 6 in the U.S., 6 in Korea and 5 in Taiwan. SP utilization rose 30% with Korea and Japan continuing with highly efficient, high usage SP programs. Utilization is also steadily increasing in Europe and the U.S. We are progressing through the early phase of a measured rollout of our SP Stapler, which we believe is a key enabler for SP adoption in colorectal and thoracic procedures.\nNow turning to Ion. We performed approximately 35,000 Ion procedures in Q2, a 52% increase over the prior year. We placed 54 Ion systems compared to 74 in Q2 of 2024. 7 of these systems were placed in markets outside the U.S. The installed base of Ion systems expanded to 905 systems and average system utilization increased 8% from the year ago period.\nTurning now to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 67.9%, down from 70% in Q2 of last year. The year-over-year decline reflects higher facilities costs, including depreciation related to new manufacturing capacity a greater mix of lower-margin Ion and da Vinci 5 revenue and higher service costs related to da Vinci 5. In addition, Q2 results also reflected an impact of approximately 60 basis points from tariffs. Clearly, the trade environment continues to be dynamic. We are currently estimating the impact of tariffs for the year to be approximately 100 basis points, plus or minus 20 basis points. lower than the estimate we provided on last quarter's earnings call, primarily reflecting the reduction of bilateral tariff rates relating to U.S.-China trade. Our estimate for the year assumes the following: imports from China to U.S. bear a tariff rate of 30%. Imports into China or subassemblies and finished goods from the U.S. are subject to a 10% tariff. Imports into the U.S. from all other countries bear a 10% tariff rate and the imports from Mexico and Canada that comply with USMCA continue to be exempt from tariffs.\nAs a reminder, we expect the impact of tariffs to increase each quarter this year as tariff expense roll through inventory into cost of sales. Given the uncertainty surrounding what tariff rates will ultimately be enacted it is possible future tariff rates could have a significant incremental impact on our cost of sales. During the quarter, we opened a new 187,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Bulgaria with land to expand further as needed. This site will initially be focused on our portfolio of more mature endoscope products. Over time, we expect to further increase our manufacturing footprint in Germany and Mexico, given our midterm need for additional capacity to support revenue growth and our strategy to operate at industrial scale. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year driven by higher head count and increased facility costs, including depreciation, partially offset by lower legal expenses. We added approximately 300 employees during the quarter, approximately half of whom were in manufacturing roles in support of customer demand.\nPro forma other income was $93 million for the quarter, up from $91 million in the prior quarter, reflecting higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for Q2 was 22.7%, in line with our expectations. We are at the early stages of evaluating recent U.S. tax reform. And at this point, we do not anticipate a material impact to our 2025 tax rate. We are still evaluating potential impacts for 2026. Pro forma net income for the second quarter was $798 million compared with $641 million last year. Pro forma earnings per share increased 23% year-over-year to $2.19 per share.\nNow turning to our GAAP results. GAAP net income for the quarter was $658 million or $1.81 per share compared to $527 million or $1.46 per share in Q2 of last year. The differences between our pro forma and GAAP results are outlined and quantified on our website. We ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and investments, up from $9.1 billion last quarter. The sequential increase was driven by operating cash flow, partially offset by stock repurchases of $181 million and $155 million in capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repurchased 350,000 shares at an average price of $518 per share.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dan to discuss recent clinical publications and our outlook for 2025.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Jamie. Turning to the clinical side for our business. I'd like to share with you data from recent studies that we found notable. In addition to the specific data highlighted on this call, we encourage you to consider the wide body of evidence detailing these topics and publish scientific studies over the years.\nThis past June, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, Dr. Feng from Chongqing Hospital, Fudan University on behalf of the investigator team reported 3-year results from a randomized trial comparing robotic and laparoscopic surgery for middle and low rectal cancer. Known as the REAL study. This study examined local regional recurrence rates with more than 580 subjects in each of the robotic-assisted arm and laparoscopic arm. Recall secondary short-term outcomes from this study were published in the Lancet Gastroenterology and Hematology in November 2022 and described on our earnings call in January 2023. That publication reported robotic-assisted surgery resulted in a better oncological quality resection, less surgical trauma and better postoperative recovery when compared to the laparoscopic approach. In the current JAMA publication, the primary outcome was the 3-year local regional recurrence rate, which was defined as any case of cancer recurrence in the pelvic or perineal area at 3 years after surgery. The authors reported that the robotic-assisted group demonstrated a 55% lower risk of local regional recurrence at 3 years compared to laparoscopy. The authors concluded \"compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery significantly improved long-term oncological outcomes in patients with middle or low rectal cancer. With additional real-world clinical data and modern improved training programs for surgeons, robotic surgery could be the preferred choice for patients with middle or low rectal cancer.\" With the launch of the da Vinci 5 platform, we are starting to see evidence emerged that describes the value that new features such as force feedback technology and case insights may bring to minimally invasive surgery. At this month's Society of Robotic Surgery Annual Meeting, Dr. Laila Rashidi from MultiCare Health System in Tacoma, Washington, presented data from her single surgeon experience. Dr. Rashidi analyzed relationships between clinical outcomes and objective performance indicators or OPIs, such as the force measured during surgery using force feedback instruments. To conduct the study, Dr. Rashidi and colleagues used OPIs generated by Case Insights, an AI-enabled solution that combines surgical video with data from the da Vinci platform. Their analysis of 28 low anterior resection cases revealed that certain patient factors and OPIs were associated with the outcomes in these colorectal procedures.\nSpecifically, higher forces, especially during the dissection phase of surgery and prior surgery were associated with increased length of stay. The strongest predictor of length of stay was the percent of force time above 6.5 newtons. Dr. Rashidi and team concluded in part \"this early dV5 experience demonstrates that patient factors and OPIs are associated with clinical outcomes in robotic-assisted low anterior resection. Advancements in the technologies integrated with robotic platforms can assist surgeons by identifying factors that predict complications and aiding the optimization of techniques for specific patients ultimately supporting safer, gentler and more precise surgery.\" While these results are early, we are encouraged to see results that are consistent with the core hypotheses of the value that force feedback technology and case insights may bring to minimally invasive surgery. We continue to expect clinical evidence to build over the coming quarters and years.\nI will now turn to our updated financial guidance for 2025, starting with da Vinci procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2025 da Vinci procedure growth within a range of 15% and 17%. We are updating our 2025 da Vinci procedure growth guidance to be within a range of 15.5% and 17%. Consistent with last quarter, the low end of the range assumes growth in China is impacted by trade, environmental and competitive dynamics. Governments in key OUS markets continue to constrain hospital CapEx budgets, which limits the expansion of capacity in the field and bariatric procedures continue to decline at rates similar to recent trends. The high end of the range assumes China procedure growth improves relative to 2024. The CapEx environment improves in key OUS markets and bariatric procedure declines moderate. The high end of the range also assumes that da Vinci procedures are not impacted by the current trade environment.\nTurning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast pro forma gross profit margin in 2025 to be within a range of 65% and 66.5% of revenue, which reflected significant incremental depreciation as we bring on new facilities, the combination from growth and -- contribution from growth in newer products and the expected impact of tariffs. As Jamie described earlier, we currently expect the recently implemented tariffs globally to increase our 2025 cost of sales by approximately 1% of revenue, plus or minus 20 basis points. As a result, we are updating our estimate for pro forma gross margin to be within a range of 66% and 67% of revenue.\nIn regards to operating expenses, we continue to expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 10% and 14%, which includes increased appreciation from new facilities and investments to drive our growth objectives. We continue to expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $770 million and $790 million. We now expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $370 million and $390 million.\nWith regards to capital expenditures, we now estimate a range of $650 million to $725 million, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2025 pro forma income tax rate to be between 22% and 23% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments.\nAs we open the line for questions, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 or 2 questions."

Welcome to the Q4 2024 Intuitive Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Brandon Lamm, Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical.\n\nBrandon Lamm\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Jamie Samath, our CFO; Daniel [ O ], our Senior Medical Officer. Dave Rosa, our President and regular participant on this call is away from the office this week on a prior business commitment and will not be joining today. Dr. Daniel [ O ], Senior Medical Officer and practicing surgeon will join us on this call to describe clinical highlights. We will also -- we would also like to announce that Dan Connolly will be joining Intuitive as our VP and Head of Investor Relations.\nDan has worked at a global investment manager for the last 18 years and has actively followed surgical robotics since 2008. We look forward to Dan joining Intuitive in early February.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent filings. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.\nToday's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our full year and fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results and procedure highlights. Dan will present clinical highlights. Then I will provide our financial outlook for 2025. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThank you for joining us today. I'll touch on our performance for the full year 2024 and share our perspective going into 2025.\n2024 was a strong year for Intuitive with robust early adoption of our fifth-generation multiport platform, da Vinci 5, and healthy procedure growth in many of our supported indications in countries, resulting in strong financial performance for the year. Adoption of our Ion and da Vinci SP platforms continued with new global clearances and increased utilization. Our teams have been hard at work launching da Vinci 5 and learning from its early experience. We are improving our products across all 3 of our platforms and helping our customers achieve their programmatic objectives.\nWe started 2024 focused on four main thrusts. First, we expanded indications and launches of our new platforms by region, with a particular focus on our first phase of da Vinci 5 launch. Second, we pursued increased adoption for focused procedures by country through training, commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we drove quality and gross margin improvements in our global operations. And finally, we focused on increasing our productivity, particularly in functions that benefit from industrial scale. Taken together, our team made excellent progress against these objectives.\nMoving to procedures. Growth for the full year was 17%. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States and regional performance in countries, including the U.K. and Ireland, Japan and Germany. Distribution markets, including Brazil, Spain and Italy were also strong in the year. This week, we announced the acquisition from [ AB Medica ] of the da Vinci business in Italy, Spain, Portugal and related territories. We're pleased with their performance, and we look forward to welcoming these new staff to our team.\nIn the U.S., General surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy with foregut and appendectomy procedures rising as well. Thoracic procedure growth was also healthy in the year. Bariatric procedures fell modestly for the full year 2024, given the rise in GLP-1 medications. Procedure growth outside the United States continued to diversify beyond urology with nice growth in categories including general surgery and thoracic surgery. Globally, benign indications grew approximately 200 basis points faster in the year than cancer indications.\nIn flexible robotics Ion procedures showed continued strength with 78% growth for the full year. SP procedure growth accelerated in the year with 72% growth over a full year, a result of healthy growth in Korea, Japan and Europe and solid growth in the U.S.\nOn the capital front, we placed 1,432 port systems in the full year 2024, compared with 1,313 multiport systems in 2023. Ion placements for the full year were 271, versus 213 prior year. And SP placements were 96 for the full year, versus 57 systems in the prior year. Globally, placements were strong in the United States, helped by the launch of da Vinci 5. Overall, our systems portfolio of da Vinci 5, da Vinci Xi, da Vinci X, da Vinci SP and Ion, combined with our flexible financing options allows our team to meet our customers' varying needs. Jamie will take you through placement dynamics in more detail later in the call.\nSystem utilization remains an important indicator of customer health because it is correlated to patient demand, care team satisfaction and hospital financial health. Multiport utilization grew 3% in the year. SP utilization grew 12% in the year, and Ion utilization grew 13%. Given our different platforms, their procedure mix and sites of care, teasing apart system utilization by customer segment becomes increasingly important going forward.\nFor example, a midsized community hospital lung program, systems utilization can differ from a high-volume community hospital general surgery program. As robot-assisted surgery moves to the back half of adoption curves and some procedures, utilization growth rates may differ from prior year trends.\nOur performance supported revenue of $8.4 billion for the year, of which 84% was recurring and representing 17% growth over 2023. Our operating expenses were at the lower end of our spend guidance. Our spending reflects three initiatives.\nFirst, we continue to invest in R&D to support innovation and adoption of our platforms and digital tools globally. Second, we're expanding our manufacturing and commercial footprints. And lastly, we have sought to leverage our enabling functions given our increased scale.\nOur product margins also started to improve in the year as increased shipment volume allowed for better factory utilization as well as leverage in our component shipment and other logistics costs. Taken together, our net income grew by 29% in 2024 over 2023.\nTouching briefly on da Vinci 5, our teams have done a nice job in executing a complex launch. We placed 362 da Vinci 5s in the year, and over 2,500 surgeons have performed in total, over 32,000 procedures on da Vinci 5 in 2024. Da Vinci 5 has broad clinical indications and over 40 different procedure types have been performed using da Vinci 5 to date. We design our systems to allow for routine sequential upgrades to their capability over time. And da Vinci 5 customers will receive hardware and software upgrades going forward starting this year. This year's upgrades will focus on digital features supported by our 10,000 increase in computing power. We'll share more details on these features as we bring them to market.\nAs we enter 2025, our company priorities are as follows. First, we will focus on the full launch of da Vinci 5, its regional clearances and follow-on feature releases. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for our focused procedures by country through training commercial activities and market access efforts. Third, we'll drive continued progress in building industrial scale, product quality and manufacturing optimization. And finally, we'll focus on excellence and availability of our digital tools.\nJamie, over to you.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nVP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, and will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2024 revenue procedures and system placements are in line with our preliminary press release of January 15. I will briefly review full year 2024 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail.\n2024 financial performance was strong. Da Vinci procedures and total revenue each grew 17% over the prior year. Pro forma gross margin improved 100 basis points to 69.1% and pro forma SG&A expenses leveraged as compared to 2023. As a result, pro forma operating margin for 2024 improved 310 basis points to 37%, and pro forma EPS increased 28%, building off of the 22% increase in 2023. We placed 362 da Vinci 5 systems in our first year of the limited launch, of which 174 systems were placed in Q4, including our first replacements of da Vinci 5 in Korea.\nTurning to Q4. Our financial performance was ahead of our expectations, driven by revenue growth of 25% and strength across the rest of the P&L, resulting in pro forma operating margin of 38%. Q4 revenue reflected a couple of favorable dynamics.\nFirst, a higher purchase mix of systems as compared to recent periods, driven by multisystem deals with certain U.S. IDNs that prefer to purchase and a higher mix of placements through distributors.\nSecond, we saw a higher mix of dual console placements for da Vinci 5 as we increase supply and were able to support more academic customers.\nAnd finally, we saw a higher system ASP, resulting from a stronger mix of da Vinci 5 placements.\nUnderlying core metrics were also strong with da Vinci procedure growth of 18%, growth in the installed base of da Vinci Systems of 15%, and average system utilization growth of 3%. In Q4, U.S. procedures grew 15%, driven by growth in benign general surgery, including accretive growth in procedures performed after hours for emerging care. Bariatric procedures in the U.S. declined in the low to mid-single-digit range, similar to last quarter.\nOUS procedures grew 25%, driven by relative strength in India, the U.K., Italy and Japan. Procedure growth in Korea improved sequentially, in part driven by strong SP growth. However, our business there continues to be impacted by physician strikes. Consistent with the last couple of quarters, procedure growth in China was slightly below the corporate average, reflecting a continuation of the dynamics we have described on previous calls.\nLooking at OUS procedure performance in aggregate, we see strong growth in colorectal, benign general surgery and thoracic categories. Reviewing capital performance. We placed 493 systems in the fourth quarter, 19% higher than the 15 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. In the U.S., we placed 284 systems in Q4, an increase of 75 systems as compared to last year, reflecting several large multisystem placements with a number of IDNs and an increase in the supply of da Vinci 5. Outside the U.S., we placed 209 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 206 in the same quarter last year. This quarter, we placed 89 systems in Europe, 43 in Japan, and 20 in China compared with 71 in Europe, 70 in Japan and 11 in China in Q4 of last year.\nPlacements in the U.K. and Germany continue to be impacted by ongoing government budget pressures affecting health care capital spending. The 89 system placements in Europe included 39 systems into markets served by our distributors as compared to 24 systems last year. In Japan, financial pressures caused some customers to delay capital investment decisions.\nFourth quarter revenue was $2.41 billion, a 25% increase over last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 26%. Systems revenue grew 36% year-over-year, driven by a 19% increase in da Vinci system placements, a higher system ASP and the higher purchase mix previously referenced. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows.\nLeasing represented 45% of Q4 placements, compared with 58% last quarter, driven by the aforementioned mix of system placements from certain IDNs in the U.S. who prefer to purchase and a higher mix of placements with our distributors. However, as we look forward, we continue to expect that leasing rates will increase over time. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.59 million, as compared to $1.42 million last year driven by higher mix of da Vinci 5 and a higher dual-console mix, partially offset by lower pricing in China. We recognized $28 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter, compared with $21 million last year.\nDa Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,860, compared with approximately $1,800 last year. The year-over-year increase in I&A per procedure reflects customer buying patterns and a higher mix of SP procedures, partially offset by procedure mix in the U.S. given a lower mix of bariatric procedures and a higher mix of cholecystectomy.\nTurning to Ion. There were approximately 28,000 Ion procedures performed in the fourth quarter, an increase of 70% as compared to last year. In Q4, we placed 69 Ion systems compared to 44 in Q4 of 2023. As a reminder, supply constraints impacted Ion system placements in the fourth quarter of last year. 7 of the 69 systems were placed in OUS markets. The installed base of Ion systems increased 51% from last year to 805 systems and average system utilization increased 13% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter SP procedure growth continued to accelerate, growing 81%, driven by Korea and early-stage growth in Europe and Japan, where we have clearance for a broad set of indications. We placed 30 SP systems in Q4 and 96 for the year, up from 57 placements in 2023. Fourth quarter placements included 7 in Korea, 6 in Europe and 4 in Japan. Average system utilization for our SP platform grew 18% in Q4, reflecting in part growth of SP in markets where we have a broad set of indications.\nWe have received recent clearances in the U.S. for thoracic and colorectal indications. However, we expect broad commercial efforts for SP in those procedure categories to commence once we obtain FDA clearance for a SP stapler.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 69.5%, compared with 68% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin reflects fixed overhead leverage given revenue growth, lower inventory reserves and improvements in freight and logistics costs. In 2024, we executed on our plans to significantly improve product margins for our Ion and SP platforms. While we have made substantial progress, Ion and SP product margins continue to be dilutive and our teams have ongoing programs to deliver further improvement.\nWith respect to our manufacturing expansion and capital investment plans. In 2025, we anticipate opening new facilities the da Vinci 5 and Ion system manufacturing in California and new endoscope manufacturing facilities in Germany and Bulgaria. As a result, and as we have previously indicated, we expect a significant increase in depreciation expense in 2025. We will also continue to transfer mature products to facilities in [indiscernible], Georgia and [ Mexicali ]. Given these activities, we expect elevated inventory levels during 2025.\nAs we complete this cycle of manufacturing expansion that is driven by our strategy to operate at industrial scale, we anticipate lower levels of capital expenditures in 2025 and 2026 as compared to recent periods.\nFourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 9% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount, higher variable compensation and increased legal expenses. Fourth quarter 2024 operating expenses included a $45 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, as compared to a $40 million contribution in Q4 of last year.\nLooking at operating expenses for the year, we delivered on planned leverage in SG&A, which improved by 180 basis points as a percentage of revenue. While we will continue to look for opportunities within SG&A to leverage as we grow, we would highlight that in 2025, we expect increased depreciation expenses given recent capital expenditures and higher legal expenses given ongoing litigation. Innovation continues to be critical to helping our customers make progress in the [indiscernible] and therefore, you should expect us to prioritize investments in R&D.\nPro forma other income was $87.6 million for Q4, lower than $94.6 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by FX remeasurement of the balance sheet. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.5%, a little lower than our expectations, reflecting net discrete benefits of $11 million related to statute of limitation expirations and other adjustments to certain tax items. Fourth quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $805 million, or $2.21 per share, compared with $574 million or $1.60 per share for the fourth quarter of last year.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $686 million, or $1.88 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $606 million, or $1.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2023 GAAP tax expense reflected onetime benefits of $159 million related to an increase in deferred tax assets associated with the statutory rate increase in Switzerland and receipt of certain tax benefits related to our Swiss operations. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website.\nWe ended the year with cash and investments of $8.8 billion, compared with $8.3 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures of $312 million.\nWith respect to the plans we announced on Tuesday to go direct in Italy, Spain, Portugal and associated territories, the base purchase price is EUR 290 million with an earn-out of up to an additional EUR 31 million based on 2025 procedure volumes. While our primary motivation is to develop closer relationships with customers serving a combined population of approximately 118 million people, we do expect this transaction, which we estimate to close in the first half of 2026, to be slightly accretive to pro forma EPS.\nBefore I turn it over to Dan to discuss clinical highlights, let me address the outlook for pro forma operating margins for 2025. Q4 performance of 38% was above our expectations. Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate pro forma operating margins in 2025 to be lower than Q4 due to several dynamics.\nFirst, as previously stated, leasing rates are expected to be higher than Q4, which results in revenue and profits for related system placements to be recorded over multiple years versus in the quarter of placement. Second, we anticipate significantly higher depreciation expense given recent capital expenditures. And finally, we expect a higher mix of da Vinci 5, Ion NSP revenue, which carry product margins below the corporate average. In addition, from a modeling perspective, I would also highlight a couple of additional considerations.\nFirst, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represents approximately 25% of our total revenue. On a revenue-weighted basis, using current exchange rates, the U.S. dollar is approximately 4% stronger than rates realized in Q4.\nSecond, as we move into broad launch of da Vinci 5 in the middle of the year and customers have the opportunity to upgrade their fleets, we would expect trading credits for [ NXi ] to be significantly higher than recent periods adversely impacting system ASPs.\nFinally, given the increasing choice customers have, as competitors bring robotic systems to the market and seek geographical clearances, we may see capital selling cycles lengthen as customers evaluate alternatives. Brandon will provide our outlook for 2025 later in this call.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Dan.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Jamie. I'd like to share with you some recently published peer review literature that we found to be notable. In addition to the specific data highlighted on this call, we encourage you to consider the wide body of evidence detailing these topics in published scientific studies over the years.\nToday, we'll give an update on two recent publications. In the first study, Dr. [ Roko Ricciardi ] and colleagues from the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston collaborate with the research team at Intuitive for the [ COMPARE ] study published in the [indiscernible] of surgery. This landmark study compared perioperative outcomes of da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery, to laparoscopic or thoracoscopic surgery, as well as to open procedures. This was a meta-analysis, which analyzes results from previously published evidence over time to obtain an overview of cumulative data.\nIn this study, the investigators pull data from randomized controlled trials, prospective comparative cohort studies and large real-world evidence database studies from the past 12 years. In order to evaluate whether da Vinci procedures were associated with an improvement in short-term patient outcomes across 7 commonly performed oncologic procedures from different specialties. Notably, over 1 million patients were included in each of the da Vinci, laparoscopic thoracoscopic and open patient groups, and included data from 22 countries.\nThe authors found that compared to standard minimally invasive surgery, patients undergoing da Vinci procedures had favorable perioperative outcomes. Specifically, da Vinci patients had a 56% lower chance of conversion to open, 21% lower chance of receiving a blood transfusion, and 10% less likelihood to experience a complication within 30 days of the procedure. In addition, length of stay was significantly shorter with lower 30-day readmission and mortality rates.\nSimilar favorable outcomes were found for da Vinci patients when compared to the open approach with even greater magnitude differences between the two approaches. The authors concluded that this meta analysis demonstrated multiple benefits for da Vinci procedures when compared to alternative minimally invasive or open approaches, noting that these results will be helpful to decision-makers considering the use of robotics in multi-specialty settings.\nIn the second study, Dr. Michael [ Awad ] from Washington University School of Medicine and other colleagues published in Surgical Endoscopy the results of a preclinical study using Intuitive's novel force feedback technology incorporated in da Vinci 5. Across 28 surgeons with varying levels of experience, this study evaluated the forces applied to tissue when having force feedback technology on or off during core surgical tests, including retraction, dissection and suturing in a tissue model.\nResults from this study demonstrated a significant reduction in both the average and maximum forces exerted on tissue for all 3 surgical tests, irrespective of surgeon experience levels. Notably, when using the highest sensitivity setting, up to a 55% reduction of the maximum force exerted on tissue during suturing was observed. The authors concluded that this study demonstrated that force feedback technology may significantly decrease the forces applied at the tissue level when performing common surgical tests across novice, intermediates and experienced surgeons.\nThey continue to note ,\"this innovative technology has the potential to enable safer and gentler surgeries, resulting in better surgical outcomes for patients undergoing robotic-assisted surgery\". To me, the notable finding in this study is that the benefit of force feedback was observed not just in novice surgeons, which one might expect, but also in experienced surgeons who had completed at least 200 da Vinci procedures.\nNow I'll turn it over to Brandon.\n\nBrandon Lamm\n\nThank you, Dan. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2025. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total of 2024 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 17% year-over-year to over 2,680,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2025, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%.\nThe low end of the range assumes growth in China continues to be impacted by environmental and competitive dynamics. European governments continue to constrain hospital CapEx budgets limiting the expansion of capacity in the field and bariatric procedure declines continue at rates similar to 2024. At the high end, we assume China procedure growth recovers relative to 2024, the CapEx environment improves in Europe and bariatric procedure declines moderate. Q1 and full year 2025 will have approximately 1 fewer working day in 2024 due to the leap year.\nTurning to gross profit. In 2024, our pro forma gross profit margin was 69%. In 2025, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of 67% and 68% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2025 reflects significant incremental depreciation as we bring on new facilities, the impact of growth in newer products and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and pricing. The range does not include any potential impact of new tariffs on our business, which could be material.\nTurning to operating expenses. In 2024, our pro forma operating expenses grew 10%. In 2025, we expect our pro forma operating expense growth to be within a range of 10% and 15%. The growth in operating expenses reflects increased depreciation from new facilities, investments in innovation to drive our growth objectives, and an increase in legal expenses. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $760 million and $790 million in 2025. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $370 million and $400 million in 2025.\nWith regard to capital expenditures, we expect the range to total between $650 million and $800 million, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, in 2024, our pro forma income tax rate was 21.4%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2025 pro forma income tax rate to be within a range of 22% and 23% of pretax income.\nThat concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Brian King. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian King\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Dave Rosa, our President; and Jamie Samath, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent filings. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.\nToday's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will introduce the call and provide an organization update. Dave will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2024. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the quarter, with solid procedure growth and strong capital placements resulting in healthy financial performance. In the quarter, we made good progress with all 3 of our system platforms, including taking our measured rollout of da Vinci 5 to our next phase, continuing to stabilize Ion supply in support of customer expansion and expanding da Vinci SP installs in Europe, while supporting SP procedure growth across regions. Some multiport procedure headwinds continued from last quarter, and we will describe these later on the call.\nBefore turning the time over to Dave, I'd like to thank Marshall Mohr, our prior CFO and our outgoing Head of Global Business Services. Marshall will be taking his skills to pursuits outside of Intuitive in September this year as he approaches his next endeavor. I thank him on behalf of all of us for his outstanding stewardship at Intuitive for the past 18 years. We are pleased to announce that in addition to his role as CFO, Jamie will expand his responsibilities to leading our information technology and global facilities teams.\nI'll now turn the time over to Dave, who will take you through commercial and operational highlights in greater detail.\n\nDavid J. Rosa\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary. Starting with procedures. We experienced solid growth in the quarter of nearly 17% compared with a strong Q2 2023, which reflected the return of patients post pandemic. Cholecystectomy, colon resection, lung resection and foregut procedures led global procedure growth. General surgery led U.S. procedure growth in the second quarter. And outside the U.S., procedure growth was led by non-urology procedures. Regional performance included strength in Europe, led by Germany, the U.K. and Italy. And in Asia, we have mixed market conditions largely consistent with Q1. Brian will describe these dynamics later in the call.\nTurning to capital. We placed 341 da Vinci systems in the quarter, of which 320 were multiport systems, including 70 da Vinci 5 systems. Our teams installed 21 SP systems and 74 Ion systems in the quarter, with solid capital placements in the U.S., Japan and India and pressure in Europe and China. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 2% globally year-over-year for our multiport platforms, lower than our historical trend, reflecting procedure strength a year ago due to patient backlogs. Utilization for SP and Ion continue to grow in the double-digit range in the quarter.\nTurning to our finances. Revenue growth of 14% in the quarter reflects solid procedure performance and strong capital placements. Product margins were above our expectations, reflecting a combination of cost reductions fixed overhead leverage and some onetime nonrecurring benefits. Operating expenses reflected planned leverage in our enabling functions. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call.\nIn Q2, we moved into the next phase of our rollout of da Vinci 5. Within the quarter, we placed 70 da Vinci 5 systems as the launch continues to progress in line with our plans. Customer feedback points to improvements in precision, imaging, ergonomics and integration, the combination of which customers indicate has led to overall efficiency improvements.\nBoth Force Feedback and Case Insights bring new capabilities and analytics to surgery. We are encouraged by early insights these capabilities are presenting and are working hard to improve production and supply for Force Feedback instruments and smooth our computational pipelines and workflows for Case Insights. We expect these capabilities to be powerful and the maturity and evidence of impact to build over coming quarters.\nWe launched new products thoughtfully centered around outstanding customer experiences as our customers pursue operational and clinical excellence. We continue monitoring several key metrics across our measured rollout at da Vinci 5 as we ramp our supply and respond to customer input. We expect our measured rollout to continue through the first half of 2025.\nAdoption of our digital products and services grew nicely in the quarter, with routine use of My Intuitive App expanding to nearly 14,000 surgeons and surgeons using Intuitive Hub more than doubling versus a year ago. The long-term opportunity for computational tools is both significant and difficult. To recognize these benefits at scale requires a foundational infrastructure that includes robust curated data, secure data warehousing and global privacy compliance.\nOur digital ecosystem, including Case Insights, leverages this infrastructure and enables us to collaborate with customers on a global scale to identify meaningful insights. These insights enable customers to optimize their robotic programs and ultimately reduce time to proficiency and improve clinical outcomes. As we said before, validations take time and are worthy pursuit.\nTurning to Ion. Our teams have made material progress resolving supply constraints on catheters and vision probes. Excellence in manufacturing at scale in this space is complex, and we continue to reinforce our capabilities. Our commercialization in Europe continues according to plan, and our teams are progressing towards commercialization in China.\nTurning to SP. Last week, we received FDA clearance for thoracic procedures. We will be measured in our thoracic indication launch as we work to build a robust training and proctoring network as well as bring stapling to our SP platform.\nIn closing, we are committed to our 2024 priorities, supporting our measured launch of da Vinci 5 and our other new platforms by region, supporting surgeons' adoption of focused procedures, continuing to improve product quality and margins; and finally, improving productivity and those functions that benefit from global scale.\nI'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nVP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q2 da Vinci procedures grew 17%, the installed base of systems grew 14% to just over 9,200 systems and average system utilization increased by 2%, lower than long-term historical averages reflecting procedures strength in Q2 last year as a result of patient backlogs.\nU.S. procedures grew 14%, driven by growth in general surgery. Bariatric procedures in the U.S. declined in the mid-single-digit range. OUS procedures grew 22%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures. With respect to capital performance, we placed 341 systems in the second quarter compared to 331 systems in Q2 of last year. In the U.S. we placed 149 systems in Q2 compared to 157 systems placed last year, reflecting in part lower trade-ins.\nU.S. system placements in Q2 included 70 da Vinci 5 placements. Given the planned hardware and software update to da Vinci 5 in the second half of this year, and continued focus on maturing manufacturing and expanding capacity, we expect that da Vinci 5 placements will be constrained through the first half of 2025.\nOutside the U.S., we've placed 192 systems in quarter 2 compared with 174 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 71 into Europe, 41 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China in Q2 of last year. We also saw relatively strong placements in India as well as markets served by our distributors, including Australia. Placements in Europe reflect health system budget constraints as several European governments are resetting capital spending post pandemic.\nSecond quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 14% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 15%. The -- additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: leasing represented 51% of Q2 placements, relatively consistent with recent trends. However, given customer preference for our usage-based models in the U.S. and the launch of da Vinci 5, we continue to expect the proportion of systems placed under lease arrangements to grow over time. Q2 system average selling prices were $1.44 million as compared to $1.39 million last year. Higher year-over-year system ASPs reflected a higher mix of da Vinci 5 and lower trade-ins, partially offset by a higher mix of system placements in Japan with a weaker yen exchange rate and lower pricing in China.\nIn Q2 of 2023, trade-ins represented 18% of total system placements as compared to 6% in Q2 of 2024. We recognized $28 million of lease buyout revenue in quarter 2, compared with $29 million last quarter and $12 million last year. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800 an increase of approximately $20 compared to last quarter. The sequential increase in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of customer ordering patterns in the U.S.\nTurning to our Ion platform. Procedures grew 82% to approximately 23,200 procedures in the second quarter. During the quarter, we placed 74 Ion systems compared to 59 last year and 70 last quarter. During Q2, we caught up with the remaining backlog of system placements as supply of catheters and vision probes continue to improve. The installed base of Ion systems increased 56% year-over-year to 678 systems, of which 275 are under operating lease arrangements.\nSecond quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 74%, with strong growth in Korea and the U.S. and early-stage growth in Japan and Europe. 21 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, including 10 systems placed in Europe. The SP installed base grew 56% from the year ago quarter to 222 systems.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2024 was ahead of our expectations at 70% and compared with 68.5% for the second quarter of 2023 and 67.6% last quarter. Second quarter pro forma gross margin reflected certain onetime benefits that we do not expect to recur. Excluding these onetime benefits, pro forma gross margin would have been 69.5%. The sequential improvement in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects lower inventory reserves, cost reductions in certain purchase components, lower freight rates and leverage of fixed overhead.\nIn accordance with our plans, product margins for our Ion and SP platforms improved in the quarter and will remain a focus for our business unit and manufacturing teams over the medium term. As a reminder, given recent and ongoing capital investments, we expect increased depreciation expense in the second half and a significant increase in depreciation expense starting in Q1 of 2025. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 11% compared with last year, reflecting the ongoing benefit of planned leverage in enabling functions. We continue to prioritize investments in R&D to fund innovation and future growth.\nDuring the quarter, we added approximately 550 employees of which roughly half were in our manufacturing operations to support growth in customer demand. Pro forma other income was $79.4 million for Q2, higher than $72.5 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.5%, and consistent with our expectations. Second quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $641 million or $1.78 per share compared with $507 million or $1.42 per share for the second quarter of last year.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $527 million or $1.46 per share for the second quarter of 2024, compared with GAAP net income of $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments.\nWe ended the year with cash and -- we ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.7 billion, higher than the $7.3 billion we ended last quarter, the sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures of $309 million.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Jamie. Overall, second quarter procedure growth was 17% compared to 22% for the second quarter of 2023 and 16% last quarter. In the U.S. second quarter 2024 procedure growth was 14% compared to 19% for the second quarter of 2023 and 14% last quarter. Second quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery with strength in cholecystectomy and forgo procedures and also thoracic procedures. Bariatric procedure growth declined in the mid-single-digit range. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew 22% compared with 28% for the second quarter of 2023 and 20% last quarter. Growth was led by non-urology procedures with strength in colon resection, hysterectomy and lung resection procedures.\nIn Europe, second quarter growth continued to be led by procedures beyond urology primarily from general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany, the U.K. and Italy procedure performance led the region with each experiencing strong growth in colon and rectal resection, hysterectomy and other general surgery procedures.\nIn Asia, growth in the second quarter was led by Japan and India, while growth in China was stressed and Korea procedure growth continued to be impacted by physician strikes. In Japan, overall procedure growth was solid with continued strength in colon and rectal resection, gynecology and lung resection procedures. In India, while still in the early stage of adoption, we saw strength in gynecology and general surgery procedures, particularly with growth in hysterectomy, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. China procedure growth was lower than prior period averages when compared to the same quarter a year ago, which experienced a recovery in procedures impacted by COVID. System utilization remains strong while capital placements continue to be impacted by delayed tenders and emerging domestic robotic systems.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Earlier this year, Dr. Zhang and team from the Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine published a systematic review and meta-analysis in the International Journal of Surgery that looked at open, laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery approaches to rectal cancer management. This meta analysis covered 56 studies and included over 25,000 patients, of which approximately 11,000 patients receive robotic-assisted surgery, over 13,000 patients laparoscopic surgery and over 390 patients received open surgery.\nWhen compared to the control group of both laparoscopic and open procedures, patients undergoing a robotic-assisted approach had an approximately 2 day shorter length of stay, specifically when compared to lap, the robotic assisted group was associated with a 1.7-day shorter length of stay. Relative to open surgery, the length of stay was 5.5 days shorter. The robotic-assisted approach was also demonstrated a protective effect for converting to an open procedure with 61% lower odds of conversion associated with robotics relative to the laparoscopic approach.\nFinally, when compared to the laparoscopic and open control group, the robotic-assisted approach showed less estimated blood loss, approximately 40% lower odds of urinary retention and when compared to open a higher number of harvested lymph nodes. The authors concluded, \"The robotic approach emerges as the most favorable option for managing rectal cancer when compared to open, laparoscopic and transanal techniques as it delivers the finest blend of oncological, functional and patient recovery outcomes. The digital interface of surgical robots enables a shift in the paradigm of surgical training, facilitating shorter learning curves that are more comprehensive and notably reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with them\".\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 14% and 17%. We are now narrowing our forecast and expect full year 2024 procedure growth of 15.5% to 17%. The low end of the range assumes further softening in bariatric procedures along with increasing headwinds in Asia from prolonged physician strikes in Korea and in China from delayed tenders and emerging domestic robotic systems impacting capital placements and therefore, procedure growth. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatric stabilizes at current quarter rates and headwinds in Korea and China do not get worse.\nTurning to gross profit. We are increasing our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68.5% and 69% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.\nTurning to operating expenses. We are lowering our guidance for pro forma operating expense growth to be between 10% and 13%. We are refining our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $700 million in 2024. We are narrowing our guidance for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $300 million and $320 million in 2024.\nWith regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, there is no change to our guidance of 2024 pro forma income tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income.\nThat concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to our host, Head of Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical, Brian King. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian King\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent filings. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.\nToday's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2024. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThank you for joining us today. The first quarter of 2024 was a solid one for Intuitive, where core measures of our business remain healthy. including solid procedure growth and capital placements. Furthermore, our teams delivered important milestones across several parts of our Intuitive ecosystem, including launching our next-generation multiport platform da Vinci 5, launching our da Vinci SP platform in Europe and improving our supply constraints for ion catheters. Some regional challenges existed in the quarter, which we'll describe today. Taken together, we remain enthusiastic about our opportunity and we'll work through near-term pressures by focusing on what we can control. Starting first with procedures, we experienced solid growth in the quarter of 16%, and compared with a strong Q1 of 23, that was a result of elevated patient volume from the return of patients post pandemic. Q1 of 2024, procedure performance was led by broad growth in general surgery in the United States, and by procedures beyond urology outside the United States.\nGlobally, cholecystectomy, colon resection and foregut procedures led the way. Regional performance included strength in China, Germany and the United Kingdom. In Japan, we saw a moderation of growth in urology as we reach higher levels of penetration and Q1 2023 benefited from the return of patients in backlog. In Korea, growth was lower than our expectation, primarily due to a physician strike in the country, which began in February and has continued.\nTurning to capital. We placed 313 da Vinci systems in the quarter, of which 289 were multiport systems, compared with 302 multiport systems in Q1 of '23. SP placements were 24 in the quarter versus 10 systems a year ago, and in placements for the quarter were 70 versus 55 a year ago. Capital placements were solid in the United States, our global distribution markets and in Germany. Placements in China appear to be impacted by delayed tenders and an apparent increase in provincial preference for domestic robotic competition. We saw some placement weakness in the U.K. as financial pressures in the NHS constrained access to capital. System utilization defined as procedures per installed system per quarter or 1% globally year-over-year for our multiport platform, lower than last quarter, and our historical trend, a result of a strong placement year in 2023 in which the multiport clinical installed base grew 14%, when customers addressed a COVID-related backlog.\nFor our newer platforms, utilization grew 10% for SP and 14% for ion in the quarter. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health and is a reflection of customers driving value from their systems.\nTurning to our finance. The quarter reflects solid procedure performance and capital placements. Average system selling prices declined modestly due to regional and product mix. Product margins were within our expectations, reflecting a higher mix of newer platforms. Operating expenses came in slightly below plan, resulting in pro forma operating profit growth of 18%. Jamie will take you through our finances in greater detail later in the call.\nIn the quarter, we made good progress with our new platforms. In March, we received FDA clearance for our next-generation multiport platform, da Vinci 5. Within the quarter, we placed 8 da Vinci 5 systems and surgeon completed their first cases. As we engage with customers during their activation of da Vinci 5, our customers are noting and appreciating improved precision, improved imaging improved efficiency for surgeon and staff, improved ergonomics, and they are exploring the potential of force feedback, where early surgeons are excited to test hypothesis about its procedural, clinical and learning value.\nDigital analytical capabilities of da Vinci 5 are also drawing positive reviews. In parallel with customer support, we're working hard to optimize our supply chains and manufacturing capabilities for da Vinci 5 components. We will remain in our measured rollout as we stabilize supply and respond to customer input.\nTurning to ion, our teams have made meaningful progress on resolving supply challenges for our catheter and Ion's Vision Pro, although work still remains to be done. Earlier this month, FDA reviewed our set of design and production changes and cleared an increase in an ion catheter lives from 5 lives to 8 lives alleviating some supply constraints while improving the economics for us and our customers. Also in March, we received NMPA clearance for Ion in China through a special review process for innovative medical devices. While NMPA clearance is only the first step towards commercialization in China, we believe ion can play an important role in helping to address the significant burden of lung cancer in the country.\nTurning to we received CE Mark in Europe with a broad set of indications in the quarter, and we placed 8 systems. First cases in Europe were performed this April, and we're encouraged by early customer interest for SP.\nIn closing, for 2024, our priorities are as follows: first, we'll support the measured launch of da Vinci 5 and our other new platforms by region. Second, we're focused on supporting surgeons' adoption of focused procedures. Third, we're focused on improving our product margins and quality. And finally, we're focused on improving productivity in those functions that benefit from global scale.\nI'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nVP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. In Q1, da Vinci procedures grew 16% and the installed base of systems grew 14% to 8,887 systems and average system utilization increased by 2%, lower than recent trends because of the strength in procedure growth and utilization in Q1 of last year that reflected a significant benefit from the treatment of patient backlogs. U.S. procedures grew 14%, driven by broad growth in general surgery. Bariatrics procedure growth in the U.S. continued to moderate and was flat year-over-year. OUS procedures grew 20%, reflecting strong growth in general surgery and thoracic procedures. Brian will provide additional detail on our clinical performance later in the call.\nTurning to capital. We placed 313 systems in the first quarter compared to 312 systems in Q1 of last year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements grew 16% to 284 systems. In the U.S., we placed 148 systems in Q1, including 8 da Vinci 5 placements compared with 141 systems placed in Q1 of last year. Given constrained supply of da Vinci Five, system placements may be choppy this year as some customers that are interested in da Vinci 5 decide whether to acquire a fourth generation system with an upgrade rig or wait for adequate supply. Outside the U.S., we placed 165 systems in Q1 compared with 171 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 84 into Europe, 20 into Japan and 10 into China compared with 101 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 18 into China of Q1 of last year.\nPlacements in the U.K. were below our expectations and lower than Q1 last year because of the reallocation of NHS capital funding to help address industrial actions in the NHS.\nPlacements in China continue to reflect the impact of domestic robotic competition and delayed tenders due to a broader central government focus on systematic governance across sectors, including health care. First quarter revenue was $1.89 billion, an increase of 11% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 12%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Leasing represented 51% of Q1 placements compared with 42% in Q1 of last year. Given customer preference for our usage-based models in the U.S. and the launch of da Vinci 5, we continue to expect the proportion of systems placed under lease arrangements to grow over time. Q1 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional and platform mix and lower pricing in China, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We've recognized $29 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $21 million last quarter and $24 million last year.\nDa Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780, flat to last year and down $20 compared to last quarter. The sequential decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the U.S. given strong growth in cholecystectomy and the moderation of growth in bariatrics. We have also seen larger IDNs in the U.S. look for operational efficiencies by reducing inventory.\nTurning to Ion. There were approximately 19,500 ion procedures in the first quarter an increase of 90% as compared to last year. Since launching the Ion platform in 2019, on a cumulative basis, more than 100,000 procedures have now been performed. In Q1, we placed 70 Ion systems compared to 55% in Q1 of 2023 and 44% last quarter. Q1 results reflected a partial recovery from last quarter as catheter supply improved. Our team continued to work on stabilizing supply of the catheter and VisionPro. Q1 results included 4 Ion system placements in the U.K. following European clearance last year. The installed base of Ion Systems increased 61% year-over-year to 604 systems, of which 244 are under operating lease arrangements. 24 of the systems placed in the quarter were SP systems, including 8 systems in Europe, reflecting clearance early in the quarter. First quarter SP procedure growth was 60% and with healthy growth in Korea and the U.S. and early-stage growth in Japan.\nIn the U.S., during the quarter, we completed a 510(k) submission for a thoracic indication made continued regulatory progress toward a colorectal submission and enrolled additional patients in our IDE for nipple-sparing mastectomy. The SP installed base grew 55% from the year ago quarter to 201 systems.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 67.6% and compared with 67.2% for the first quarter of 2023 and 68% last quarter. The sequential reduction in pro forma gross margin primarily reflects higher fixed costs including depreciation expense for expanded manufacturing capacity and higher costs associated with the launch of da Vinci 5. Our manufacturing and business unit teams made progress in the quarter on activities to improve gross margin over the medium term. This remains an area of key focus for us. First quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 7% compared with last year, slightly lower than expectations due to the timing of certain expenses. Pro forma operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 140 basis points lower than Q1 last year, reflecting planned leverage and enabling functions, partially offset by increased R&D to fund innovation and future growth. Pro forma other income was $72.5 million for Q1, higher than $67.1 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations. First quarter 2024 pro forma net income was $544 million or $1.50 per share compared with $444 million or $1.23 per share for the first quarter of last year.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $547 million or $1.51 per share for the first quarter of 2024 compared with GAAP net income of $361 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2023. First quarter GAAP tax expense was a benefit of $9 million, reflecting excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $111 million. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.3 billion, flat to the end of last year, the sequential changes in cash included cash generated from operating activities, offset by capital expenditures of $242 million and the net impact of employee equity plans of $46 million.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Jamie.\nOverall, first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year compared to 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 21% last quarter. In the U.S., first quarter 2024 procedure growth was 14% year-over-year compared to 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 17% last quarter.\nFirst quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery, with strength in cholecystectomy, colon resection and forgot procedures. Growth in bariatrics procedures continued to moderate and was flat year-over-year. Outside of the U.S., first quarter procedure volume grew 20% compared with 28% for the first quarter of 2023 and 29% last quarter. Over 70% of procedure volume growth, led by procedures beyond urology with strength in colon resection, hysterectomy and lung resection procedures. In Europe, first quarter growth continued to be led by general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany and the U.K. procedure performance led the region with both experiencing strong growth in colon and rectal resection, and hysterectomy procedures. In Asia, growth in the first quarter was led by China, with strong procedure performance in urology and gynecology procedures. Year-over-year procedure growth in the country benefited from a comparison period, where procedures were beginning to recover from COVID during the first quarter of 2023.\nIn Japan, while we experienced a moderation in growth in urology, overall procedure growth was healthy with strength in general surgery procedures such as colon and rectal resection in gynecology procedures. Effective June 1, 2024, 5 additional procedures will have reimbursement in Japan with 2 existing rectal resection procedures receiving an increase in reimbursement for equivalency to laparoscopic surgery. The opportunity for these procedures is relatively modest, but continues to support the adoption of minimally invasive robotic surgery across a growing set of procedures.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.\nIn the first quarter of this year, Dr. Jay Han Chan and team from University of South Florida and Tampa, Florida, published a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, describing outcomes of robotic-assisted abdominal pelvic surgery in the journal surgical endoscopy. This analysis included a review of 50 publications published through April 2021, included over 4,800 patients from randomized controlled studies and covered a variety of abdominal pelvic surgical procedures, including anti-reflux, gastrointestinal, colorectal, urologic, hernia repair and gynecologic procedures. The authors compared robotic-assisted outcomes with those from both open and laparoscopic procedures. When compared to the open approach, robotic-assisted procedures had lower rates of postoperative complications with a 32% lower risk of postoperative complications across all procedures as well as less estimated blood loss with a mean difference of 286.8 milliliters. Furthermore, length of stay was on average 1.7 days shorter for robotic-assisted procedures.\nRelative to the laparoscopic approach, rates of conversion to open for the robotic assisted group, was approximately half the rate of the laparoscopic approach. Length of stay was also shorter for robotic-assisted procedures.\nInterestingly, the authors also reported an analysis on the impact of surgeon experience comparing inexperienced versus experienced surgeons and found that the experienced robotic-assisted surgeons had a lower risk of intraoperative complications with significantly less risk in the experience group as compared with the laparoscopic group as well as a lower risk of conversion to open for the experienced surgeon relative to the laparoscopic group with comparable operative times compared to laparoscopy with experienced surgeons. The authors concluded in part that their results suggest robotic surgery may shorten length of stay and rates of conversion to open when compared to laparoscopy with experience mitigating potential differences in operating time, while improving rates of intraoperative complications and conversions to open surgery.\nIn March this year, Dr. Nicole Len Arti from the University of Texas Southwestern, along with colleagues from other hospitals and data support from the Intuitive health economics outcomes research team, reported outcomes describing the use of robotic technology in emergency general surgery cases. Published in JAMA Surgery, this analysis used the PIC AI health care database, a database that collects data from over 800 facilities to identify adult patients undergoing urgent or emergent cholecystectomy, colectomy, inguinal and ventral hernia repairs between 2013 and 2021. For reference, emergent procedures were described as those required for life-threatening or potentially disabling conditions, while urgent procedures were those where immediate intervention was needed and prioritized as first available. Over 1 million urgent or emergent procedures were identified. During the study period, the use of robotic-assisted surgery for all procedures experienced a 3.5-fold increase in cholecystectomy, a 6-fold increase for colectomy and 3-fold increase in inguinal hernia repairs. Notably, increases in the robotic-assisted approach corresponded to decreases in the open approach for these procedures as well as a decrease in laparoscopy for cholecystectomy and colectomy procedures. Furthermore, a propensity score matched analysis demonstrated a lower risk of conversion to open for the robotic-assisted approach when compared to laparoscopy. Cholecystectomy procedures with a 45% lower risk of conversion, colectomy me with a 63% lower risk, inguinal hernia repair with a 79% lower risk and ventral hernia repair with a 70% lower risk of conversion. The authors concluded, \"The application of robotic surgery and emergency general surgery has steadily increased in the past decade, which is especially useful in older patients with several comorbidities. As observed in this cohort study, compared with laparoscopic surgery. Robotic surgery appears to have resulted in lower rates of conversion to open surgery from 2013 to 2021.\nRobotic surgery also leads to a shorter or comparable post-operative length of stay in the hospital. Nevertheless, open surgery remains a key component for most emergency general surgery. As robotic surgery continues to increase in emergency general surgery, barriers to implementation need to be addressed and optimized through coordinated efforts across stakeholders.\"\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2024 procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2024 procedure growth of 14% to 17%. The low end of the range assumes further weakness in bariatric procedures, along with challenges in China from increasing provincial robotic competition and delayed tenders impacting capital placements and therefore, procedure growth. We also assume there is no benefit of patient backlog in the year. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatrics continues at flat to slightly positive growth rates and factors in China don't have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we assume any backlog of patients would decline throughout the year.\nTurning to gross profit. We continue to expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 67% and 68% of net revenue. Pro forma gross profit margin in 2024 reflects the impact of growth in our newer products, da Vinci 5, Ion and SP and the impact of capital investments that will come on to support the growth of our business. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product mix.\nTurning to operating expenses. We are holding our guidance for pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We continue to expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $710 million in 2024. We are holding our guidance for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $290 million and $320 million in 2024.\nWith regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, there is no change to our guidance of 2024 pro forma income tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q3 2023 earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Intuitive Surgical, Brian King. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian King\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; Jamie Samath, our CFO; and Dr. Myriam Curet, our Chief Medical Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023, and Form 10-Q filed on July 24, 2023.\nOur SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.\nToday's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Miriam will present clinical highlights, and I will discuss procedure details and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we saw a strong growth in procedures performed by our customers, solid new system placements and healthy growth in utilization amid market conditions that remain largely consistent with Q2.\nOur new platforms continue to gain ground with Ion installs and procedure growth continuing, SP installs and procedure growth modestly accelerating and healthy growth in customer use of our digital tools.\nTurning first to procedures. da Vinci procedure growth in the quarter was 19%. Areas of strength included general surgery for benign conditions, particularly in the United States and broad regional growth with Germany, Japan, the U.K. and India standouts. China procedure growth was in line with our global average in the quarter. U.S. dermal surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and colon resection.\nIon procedures showed continued strength with 125% growth in the quarter. SP procedure growth accelerated with 54% global growth in the quarter driven by strength in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 312 systems in Q3 compared with 305 systems in Q3 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands 8,127 multiport da Vinci systems, 490 Ion systems and 158 single-port da Vinci systems.\nOverall, our capital placement trends reflect demand for additional capacity in multiport, continued greenfield interest in our Ion system and a modest acceleration for placements of SP. The proportion of leases for new capital placements accelerated in the quarter with the U.S. using the highest leasing rates. We think the acceleration in leasing reflects the convenience of our leasing program and the maturity of our Generation 4 multiport systems.\nWhile leasing reduces in-quarter revenue relative to capital purchase, total economics are healthy for our customer and for us. Leasing allows our customers to build clinical capacity when and where they need it and provides predefined pathways for our new technology as it enters the market. The growth rate in system utilization, defined as procedures per installed system per quarter was 6%, down from 9% last quarter while still above historical growth rates.\nStrong procedure growth and increased proportion of use in benign indications shortens average procedure times and needs of scheduling. Higher utilization increases our customers' return on invested capital and is economically healthy for us.\nTurning to our finances. Our revenue grew 12% in the quarter and our operating expenses were within our spend guidance. Our spending reflects continued investments in research and development to support the growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization.\nLooking at the broader picture, our fourth-generation da Vinci platform is operating at global scale and embedded in a robust ecosystem of instruments, accessories, training and services. Customer acceptance of our Ion platform is strong. Acceptance of our da Vinci SP is accelerating with new indications in the pipeline, and our digital tools are building momentum through their early stages.\nWe welcome Dr. Myriam Curet, Intuitive's Chief Medical Officer to this call, and she will take us through our clinical perspective and some of the work we're doing to expand indications.\nOur operations teams did a fantastic job supporting our customers through the supply chain shocks of the past several years. This unavoidable effort diverted resources away from product cost reduction and as supply chain stresses ease, we're now pivoting our attention to once again lowering our product costs.\nAreas of opportunity include our Ion program, our SP accessories portfolio and our multiport accessories in advanced instrument lines. Given the timing of facilities completion, manufacturing efficiency improvements for new products and other complex projects, we expect variability in gross margin over the coming quarters as we work through these programs.\nTurning to our digital offerings, [indiscernible] of our digital tools and channels is growing nicely. Our [ SIM now ] surgical simulators are installed at the majority of our customer sites and subscription renewal rates are outstanding. Routine use of My Intuitive app by over 10,000 da Vinci surgeons grew by 140% year-over-year and is receiving strong Net Promoter Scores that continue improving over time.\nOur Intuitive [ follow-up ] media management and telepresences, [indiscernible] grew 8% in the quarter, and [indiscernible] surgical cases grew 61%.\nIn closing, core demand is healthy. We're focused on in our ecosystem internationally and driving our product cost down, particularly for our newer platforms. We are dogged in pursuit of significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics, and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity.\nI'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nVP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\nCore metrics continue to be healthy in Q3, with global procedure growth of 19% and an increase in the installed base of da Vinci Systems of 13% and an increase in average system utilization of 6%. Our key financial indicators were also healthy. Third quarter recurring revenue grew 21%. Pro forma operating margin was 36%, and pro forma earnings per share increased 23% over last year.\nProcedures in the U.S. grew 17%, reflecting a lower benefit from patient backlogs as compared to the first half of 2023.\nLast quarter, we highlighted that our growth rate in bariatric procedures in the U.S. had slowed given patient interest in weight loss drugs. In Q3, we continued to see double-digit growth albeit at a modestly lower growth rate as compared to Q2. Bariatric procedures represent between 4% and 5% of total global procedures. Based on third-party data, we believe we continue to gain market share in the bariatric surgical segment.\nOUS procedures grew 24% with relative strength in India, Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Procedure growth in China was consistent with our expectations, lower than last quarter due to a strong base period given the recovery from COVID-related lockdowns in the year ago quarter.\nConsistent with recent trends, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 31%. Within the larger cancer categories, our fastest-growing OUS procedure is colon resection, a high-value procedure led by adoption in Japan, Germany and the U.K.\nWith respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the third quarter as compared to 305 systems last year. As a reminder, system placements in Q3 of last year benefit from a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered in June of last year.\nLate in Q3, we started to see delays in tender processes in China, primarily as a result of anticorruption efforts by the central government, resulting in lower system placements in China in Q3. We expect tender delays to continue to impact system placements in China in Q4.\nQ3 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Q3 revenue growth was driven by procedure growth, partially offset by an 11% decline in systems revenue due to the significant increase in the mix of operating lease arrangements.\nOn a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue growth was also 12%. Given recent movements in exchange rates, at current rates, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger on a revenue-weighted basis as compared to the average rates realized in Q3. Revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represent approximately 24% of total revenue.\nAdditional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 159 systems in the third quarter compared to 175 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 153 systems in Q3 compared with 130 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 60 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 10 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 15 into China in Q3 of last year.\n62 of the 312 systems placed in Q3 were trading transactions compared to 71 trading transactions in the third quarter of last year. As of the end of Q3, there are approximately 440 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 85 are in the U.S.\nOperating leases represented 52% of third quarter placements compared with 37% last year. In the U.S., 70% of system placements in Q3 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 48% last year. Of the 163 operating lease placements in the quarter, 93 were usage-based arrangements, an increase compared to 54% last year, reflecting customer preferences, particularly in the U.S.\nWhile leasing may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time.\nQ3 system average selling prices were $1.4 million as compared to $1.39 million last quarter from $1.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease in system ASPs was primarily driven by lower pricing and geographical mix. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $12 million last quarter and $17 million in Q3 of 2022.\nda Vinci Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of approximately $1,830, compared with approximately $1,840 last quarter and $1,800 last year. On a sequential basis, lower [ INA ] per procedure reflected the impact of customer ordering patterns, partially offset by a full quarter impact from the [ INA ] price increase that went into effect halfway through last quarter.\nTurning to our Ion platform. In Q3, we placed 55 Ion systems as compared to 50 in Q3 of 2022. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 14,500 increased 125% as compared to last year. 16 of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems, 12 into the U.S. and 4 into Korea. SP procedures grew by 54%. Our [indiscernible] continued to accelerate growing 21% compared to Q3 of last year.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter was 68.8% compared with 68.5% last quarter and 69.8% last year. As a reminder, pro forma gross margin in Q3 of last year included a onetime benefit of approximately 50 basis points related to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. The remaining year-over-year difference in pro forma gross margin is primarily due to a higher mix of the Ion revenue, which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system ASP, partially offset by the [ INA ] price increase.\nInventory increased to approximately 180 days in Q3, higher than historical averages, driven by 2 factors: first, we have modestly increased our inventory targets given supply chain stresses over the last couple of years; and secondly, given significant capital investments we are making in manufacturing facilities and capacity, we are building bridge inventory to facilitate and [ calibrate ] number of line transfers to new locations.\nAs a result, we expect higher levels of inventory relative to historical norms into 2025.\nThird quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount-related costs. During the quarter, our head count increased by 489 employees, of which approximately 275 were for our manufacturing operations in support of revenue growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were lower by 100 basis points as compared to Q3 of last year and largely reflected planned leverage in our enabling functions.\nPro forma other income in Q3 was $58 million compared to $42 million last quarter and $7 million last year. Other income primarily consists of interest income and the increase as compared to last quarter was driven by higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances. Pro forma other income in Q3 of last year also reflected higher than typical foreign exchange losses resulting from remeasurement of the balance sheet as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar.\nCapital expenditures in Q3 were $256 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.5%, consistent with our expectations.\nThird quarter pro forma net income was $524 million or $1.46 per share compared with $429 million or $1.19 per share for Q3 of last year.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $416 million or $1.16 per share for the third quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $324 million or $0.90 per share for the third quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.5 billion compared with $7.1 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Myriam, who will discuss clinical highlights.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you. Now turning to the clinical side for our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.\nIn addition to relaying the results of one of these studies, I'd like to start by describing the status of some important Intuitive research projects underway that support our company's belief in the potential value of da Vinci systems specifically our single-port system for procedures requiring refined access to tight or difficult to reach anatomical areas.\nIn June 2021, Intuitive launched an FDA-approved clinical study focused on complex colorectal procedures, such as low anterior resection or [ white ] colectomy performed using the SP platform. Currently, enrollment is complete with [ 60 ] patients across 9 sites in the U.S. and Korea. And [indiscernible] FDA-approved trials for rapid procedures in pulmonary lobectomy and thymectomy performed using SP completed enrollment in June of this year with 32 subjects enrolled across 6 centers in the U.S.\nWe believe that Intuitive single-port technology will enable thoracic surgeons to perform [ uniportal ] lobectomy, something that may be difficult using a VATS approach. Intuitive intent to submit data from these 2 studies to the FDA after the patient follow-up outlined in the study plan and the [ data ] analysis has been completed.\nNow I'll turn to a notable study published in the [indiscernible] this past August. This study was not sponsored by Intuitive. Dr. [indiscernible] of [ McMaster ] University in Canada published early results from the RAVAL trial in a manuscript titled Robotic Lobectomy is Cost Effective and Provide Comparable Health Utility Scores to Video-assisted Lobectomy.\nThis study describes results from a multicenter, multinational, blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the da Vinci and VATS approach to pulmonary lobectomy. It analyzed 164 subjects, 81 in new robotic-assisted group and 82 in the VATS group. And all robotic-assisted lobectomies were performed with a da Vinci multi-port platform.\nNotably, the health utility score was significantly higher in the da Vinci arm at 7 weeks and 12 weeks post procedure which suggests the quality of life for patients who underwent a da Vinci lobectomy was better than for patients undergoing the VATS procedure.\nInterestingly, and related to quality of life outcomes, the [ offers ] analyzed the incremental cost-effective ratio or ICR for the robotic group relative to VATS and reported the robotic group was associated with a gain of approximately $11,000 per quality adjusted life year.\nIn addition, the median number of lymph nodes examined and sampled were significantly higher in the da Vinci Group. To summarize, the authors conclude that, \"Early results from the RAVAL trials suggest that robotic pulmonary lobectomy is a cost-effective intervention, which is associated with comparable patient-reported health utility scores when compared to VATS lobectomy\".\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss additional procedure highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Myriam. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was 19% year-over-year compared to 20% for the third quarter of 2022 and 22% last quarter. In the U.S., third quarter 2023 procedure growth was 17% year-over-year compared to 18% for the third quarter of 2022 and 19% last quarter. Q3 growth was led by procedure strength within general surgery, with particular strength in cholecystectomy and colon resection.\nOutside of the U.S., third quarter procedure volume grew [indiscernible] compared with 24% for the third quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. OUS growth was led by procedures beyond urology which now make up approximately 50% of total OUS procedures.\nGeneral surgery growth was strong, primarily in colorectal procedures followed by growth in gynecology procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy.\nIn Europe, we experienced strong growth in Germany, the U.K. and Spain. In each of the regions noted, procedure growth was led by general surgery, primarily from colorectal procedures and specifically in Germany and the U.K., hysterectomy procedures also contributed to strong growth.\nIn Asia, growth was led by Japan. More than half of the incremental procedure growth in the country was led by strong growth in general surgery procedures, consisting largely of colorectal and gastrectomy procedures. In China, procedure growth was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Growth was driven primarily in neurology, notably by prostatectomy and kidney procedures.\nIn India, while in the early stage of adoption, saw strong growth in general surgery procedures, namely cholecystectomy and hernia repair and growth in gynecology procedures.\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 20% to 22%. We are now raising the low end from 20% to 21% and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 21% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to health care, a continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S. and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending.\nAt the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes, and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we experienced in Q3. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints.\nTurning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 68.5%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.\nWith respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 14%. We are also refining our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $600 million to $610 million in 2023, lowering the range from our previous estimate of $600 million to $620 million.\nWe are increasing our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $190 million and $200 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of $160 million and $180 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates.\nWith regard to capital expenditures, we are narrowing our estimate to range between $900 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we are also refining our estimate for the 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 23% of pretax income, reducing the previous estimate of the upper end of the range from 24% to 23%.\nThat concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Brian King. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2023 and Form 10-Q filed on April 20, 2023. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.\nToday's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the second quarter with strong procedure and utilization growth and strong capital placements. Our product operations teams continue to build capacity and deliver in a dynamic supply chain environment as customers increasingly rely upon us for routine use.\nOur research and development efforts continued to build momentum in the quarter, including positive development milestones for our Intuitive ecosystem, including systems, instruments, accessories, digital tools and new indications.\nTurning first to procedures. Growth in the quarter was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery and gynecology for benign conditions, particularly in the United States. General surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth was healthy. Global procedure growth was also strong in the quarter, led by a recovery in China and continued strength in Japan, Germany and the U.K.\nIon procedures showed continued strength with 145% growth in Q2 of '23. SP procedure growth was accretive with 40% global growth in the quarter, driven by accelerating growth in the United States.\nOn the capital front, we placed 331 systems in Q2 compared with 279 systems in Q2 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands at 7,900 multiport da Vinci systems, 435 Ion systems and 142 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflected demand for additional capacity in multiport, strong interest in our Ion system and stable demand for SP as we build our SP indications.\nSystem utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 9% globally year-over-year, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. We believe real-world evidence of improvements across the quadruple aim from better patient outcomes to surgeon satisfaction and lower total cost to treat per patient episode underpin this increasing utilization.\nTurning to our finances. Our revenue grew 15% in the quarter. Our capital and operating expenses were within our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. We will continue investing in R&D, manufacturing and commercial operations to serve our global markets at industrial scale. These investments are likely to be lumpy over the next couple of years as significant operations expansions and other projects complete.\nTaking a step back, we have found that the quadruple aim is the right north star for us, focusing on demonstrable improvements to outcomes across specific procedures and patient populations, increasing patient and care team satisfaction and lowering the total cost to treat per patient episode.\nAs electronic medical records have been adopted, we have partnered with our customers to analyze this data, building real-world evidence and big data approaches to measure quadruple aim improvements within countries, regions and health systems. Paired with our ecosystem investments in training services and products and powered by digital tools that can generate actionable intelligence from surgical data, we can help our customers analyze their programs, recommend and support actions to improve performance and lower total costs. This integrated business system is catalyzing our customers' goal of strong [ MIS ] programs by servicing actionable and measurable steps.\nOur approach is scalable for us too, working for our da Vinci platforms and for Ion and opening the door to future opportunities.\nTurning to our ecosystem investments. We're making solid progress extending our offerings to new clinical domains and new regions. For da Vinci multiport, we recently obtained NMPA registration for Xi local production in China. This means our da Vinci Xi will be able to compete for the locally sourced tender subset of the recently released updated national quota.\nOur da Vinci SP team achieved several milestones recently. We completed patient enrollment for our colorectal and [ arthracic IDE ] trials, continued our first phase of launch of SP in Japan and submitted our CE mark dossier for SP in Europe.\nTurning to Ion. Our team installed their first Ion system in the U.K. and initiated first cases. For our digital tools, we have initiated our Phase I launch of CASE Insights, our name for our computational observer. CASE Insights is a tool that works with the da Vinci system and hospital data to build AI models that find correlations between surgical technique, patient populations and surgical outcomes. Our first phase of launch builds on work over the past few years with our clinical research partners to refine objective performance indicators and link them to actionable changes to improve outcomes, shortened training times and improve surgical program efficiency.\nWe think these computational tools can make a significant impact using real-world and real-time data to improve skills and outcomes and to inform future product and automation opportunities. That said, features can be built quickly but long-term validation is arduous. We're a science-driven organization and will work through validation pathways in pursuit of long-term success. We do not expect material revenue from CASE insights for the next several quarters.\nIn closing, our core business has momentum. We see a significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nVP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\nGlobal procedure growth in Q2 of 22% and reflected U.S. procedure growth of 19% and 28% procedure growth outside of the U.S. Procedures in Q2 benefited from higher patient admissions as hospitals, particularly in the U.S. catch up with patients whose diagnosis and/or treatment was delayed during the pandemic.\nConsistent with our comments last quarter, our contributions to procedure growth from surgeons new to the da Vinci platform was strong reflecting both the strength of our training capabilities and an increasing number of graduates of residency and fellowship programs who are trained on da Vinci. Within one of our target procedure areas, bariatric surgery, our growth rate in the U.S. slowed during the quarter. Some customers have indicated that they are seeing increased patient interest in weight loss drugs. It is too early to conclude if the slowing growth is a temporary pause as patients evaluate these new drug therapies or if it's a trend that continues.\nWe believe that during the quarter, da Vinci continued to gain market share in the bariatric surgical market. U.S. procedure growth of 28% reflected strength in China, the U.K., Germany and Japan. Strong procedure growth in China was driven by a continued recovery from more recent COVID-related impacts and a favorable comparison to Q2 last year, which was also impacted by the pandemic.\nConsistent with our comments last quarter, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 35% driven by increases in colorectal, hysterectomy and thoracic procedures.\nTurning to other key metrics. In Q2, the installed base of da Vinci Systems grew 13% to just over 8,000 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew almost 9% year-over-year reflecting an increasing mix of short duration benign procedures in the U.S. and customers prioritizing use of their existing assets given the financial pressures they face.\nWith respect to capital performance, we placed 331 systems in the second quarter ahead of our expectations. Capital strength in the quarter included a higher number of placements to our distributors and a higher number of multi-system deals in the U.S. relative to recent trends, reflecting in part, certain placements accelerated into Q2 from future quarters.\nDespite Q2 system placements being ahead of our expectations, customers, particularly in the U.S. appear to be cautious in their capital spending given ongoing financial pressures. We placed 279 systems in Q2 of last year, which, as a reminder, reflected a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered during the quarter.\nQ2 revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 85% of total revenue as compared to 72% for the full year 2019 and grew 20% over last year, driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements.\nAdditional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 157 systems in the second quarter compared to 150 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 174 systems in Q2 compared with 129 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 15 into China in Q2 of last year.\nDuring the quarter, the China National Health Commission published the 14th 5-year quota of 559 robotic systems. For those systems awarded to our JV under the new quota, we expect a significant majority to be placed in 2024 through 2027. We are seeing increasing participation of local competitors in tender processes under the national quota. In addition, during 2023, we have experienced pricing pressure in China as a result of provincial government policy changes and competition. These dynamics create greater variability in the outlook for our procedure, system placement and revenue performance in China.\nIn Q2, 60 of the 331 systems placed were trading transactions compared to 56 trading transactions in the second quarter of last year. As of the end of Q2, there are approximately 500 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 97 are in the U.S.\nLeasing represented 50% of Q2 placements compared with 42% for both last quarter and last year. In the U.S., 78% of system placements in Q2 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 59% last quarter. The higher rate of operating leases in the U.S. is primarily driven by an increasing customer preference for our usage-based leasing models in part due to capital budget constraints and continuing financial pressures faced by many of our customers.\nIn addition, some customers are choosing leasing structures to preserve flexibility to upgrade to next-generation technology. As a result of these dynamics and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time.\nQ2 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in system SPs was primarily driven by a higher mix of X placements for purchase deals and geographical mix. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $24 million last quarter and $23 million in Q2 of 2022. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,840 compared with approximately $1,780 last quarter and $1,900 last year.\nOn a sequential basis, higher [ INA ] per procedure was driven primarily by the [ INA ] price increase we described last quarter and customer ordering patterns.\nTurning to our Ion platform. In Q2, we placed 59 Ion systems as compared to 41 in Q2 of 2022. Second quarter Ion procedures of approximately 12,700 increased 145% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we placed our first Ion system in the U.K. market and in this early phase of our European launch, we are focused on the collection of clinical data in support of our reimbursement strategy. 12 of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, compared to 10 systems last quarter. SP procedures grew by 40% and average system utilization growth accelerated from last quarter's 12%, increasing by 14% compared to Q2 of last year.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter was 68.5% compared with 67.2% last quarter and 69.2% last year. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to a higher mix of Ion revenue which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system SP.\nAs we described last quarter, improving product costs and manufacturing efficiency is a priority for our teams over the medium term. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased headcount added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, increased prototype expenses and increased expenses associated with customer training in support of procedure growth.\nPro forma operating expenses represented 33% of revenue in Q2 compared to 35% of revenue for the full year 2022, reflecting in part planned leverage in our enabling functions.\nCapital expenditures in Q2 were $178 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter pro forma net income was $507 million or $1.42 per share compared with $415 million or $1.14 per share for Q2 of last year.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.1 billion compared with $6.6 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities, proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Jamie. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 22% year-over-year compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. In the U.S., second quarter 2023 procedure growth was 19% year-over-year compared to 11% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter.\nQ2 growth continued to be driven by strong growth in procedures within general surgery, with particular strength in cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Bariatrics growth was healthy in the quarter but as noted earlier, growth was lower than in prior periods. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew 28% compared with 22% for the second quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. Second quarter 2023 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in general surgery, primarily from strong growth in colorectal procedures, followed by growth in thoracic procedures.\nGrowth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., Germany and Spain. In all the regions noted, procedure growth was driven by colorectal and hysterectomy procedures.\nIn Asia, growth was led by China, where we saw a continuing recovery in procedures that were impacted by COVID and benefiting from a favorable comparison to procedure volume that was impacted in the same quarter a year ago.\nProcedure growth was led by strong growth in urology, namely prostatectomy and kidney procedures. In Japan, growth was led by general surgery with the largest procedure contributions coming from colorectal and gastrectomy procedures. While still at earlier stages of adoption, India and Taiwan, both demonstrated strong growth in gynecology and general surgery procedures.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.\nThis past May, [ Dr. Zhang ] from the second affiliated hospital of [ Gazing ] University in China, published a systematic review in meta-analysis comparing outcomes of robotic right colectomy procedures with outcomes associated with laparoscopic right colectomy. Published in techniques in [ Coloproctology ], this meta analysis evaluated a total of 15,241 patients across 42 studies with over 2,700 subjects in the robotic right colectomy group and over 12,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group and included outcomes associated with the entire population as well as outcomes for both intracorporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis.\nLooking at the population overall, the authors reported among other outcomes, an approximately half day shorter length of hospital stay, 51% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy and a 12% lower risk of complications with a robotic approach. Notably, in the subgroup specifically comparing outcomes for procedures within [ intracaorial ] anastomosis. The robotic right colectomy group was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay by approximately 16 hours and a 65% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy. Within the extracorporeal anastomosis subgroup, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 40% lower risk of overall complications.\nThe authors concluded in part that, \"The safety and efficacy of robotic right colectomy is superior to laparoscopic right colectomy, especially when an [ intrincorprial ] anastomosis has performed\".\nTurning to a clinical study reporting outcomes for robotic-assisted and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, [ Dr. Murai ] from Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, published outcomes comparing lobectomies performed with either approach using the National Cancer database. This study focused on patients with complex etiology, such as non-small cell lung cancer who have received neoadjuvant therapy at [ N1.2 ] disease or had a tumor greater than 5 centimeters and compared 9,500 subjects with over 2,100 in the robotic arm and over 7,000 in the [ bats ] arm.\nNotably, when analyzing rates of conversions to open, the authors reported a 7.7% lower rate of conversion to open in the robotic arm with an approximately 2x higher risk of conversion associated with the [ bats ] group. The authors concluded, \"In summary, our analysis of the National Cancer Database suggests that robotic lobectomy for complex lung resections achieved similar perioperative outcomes and [ R0 ] resections [indiscernible] lobectomy with the exception of a lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy\".\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 18% to 21%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 20% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to health care, continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S. and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending. At the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes, and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we saw in Q2. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints.\nTurning to gross profit. We continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.\nWith respect to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are also updating our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range $600 million to $620 million in 2023, narrowing the range from our previous estimate of $600 million to $630 million.\nWe are increasing our estimate for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $160 million and $180 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of $140 million and $160 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $800 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities.\nWith regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThank you for joining us today. Use of our products grew strongly in the first quarter versus a year ago, helped by positive surgical trends and strong execution by our team. New capital installs were likewise strong as customers built their da Vinci and Ion system capacity to meet demand. Revenue grew 14% on the back of this continued adoption.\nSome manufacturing and supply challenges this quarter negatively impacted our product margins. This is an opportunity for sharper execution going forward. Our R&D and innovation engines are making good progress with the strength in Ion adoption, progress in our digital efforts and indication expansions for Ion and SP. Overall, our core business remains strong with some near-term procedure and product cost dynamics that we'll discuss today.\nStarting with procedures, we saw a surprising strength in the quarter led by general surgery in the United States and procedure growth beyond urology outside the United States. On a procedure basis, cholecystectomy, bariatric surgery and hernia repair led the way.\nAll our major regions performed well. Standouts included India, Spain, U.K., Japan, Germany and Italy. U.S. performance was significantly above trend, and China is recovering from lows in Q4, though not yet meeting our expected 2023 run rate.\nGiven that first quarter of the year exceeded our procedure expectations, we're reviewing underlying drivers. The return of patients to health care providers and diagnostic pipelines post-pandemic continues, with evidence of both an increased patient census and some diagnostic pipelines running above pre-pandemic levels after several years of lag. We also see a commitment by our hospital customers to work through staffing constraints to maintain surgical volume.\nLastly, customers are expressing confidence in our products as a clinically and economically sustainable path forward for minimally invasive surgery. Taken together, we see continued share gain from open surgery and laparoscopy in several procedures and in several countries as evidence accumulates in our favor.\nStrong growth in procedures and a capable product portfolio has supported a healthy capital placement quarter. Worldwide, we placed 312 da Vinci systems and 55 Ion systems in Q1 compared with 311 da Vinci systems and 34 Ion systems in Q1 2022.\nCapital placements were healthy in the United States, our distribution markets, the U.K. and in India in the quarter. Our product portfolio and our teams are competing effectively with the offerings of a growing set of competitors, notably in OUS markets where customers have had more time to evaluate the relative strengths of our offerings.\nProcedures per system per quarter grew 13% during Q1 versus a year ago. Systems are being used more hours per operating day, and customers are increasing the mix of shorter-duration procedures. Both trends are good, long-term indicators for our business. Customers are finding more value in their systems and are moving more of their procedure volume onto our devices compared to other surgical approaches.\nTurning to our finances. Our revenue growth of 14% reflects the strength of our procedures and capital placements, while average selling prices remained stable. Our margins were pressured primarily by charges taken in our stapling line due to a raw material lot non-conformance that necessitated scrapping instruments. We also experienced lower manufacturing yields during the bring-up of new production lines in our high-volume production facilities to support multiport accessory and Ion catheter growth. Customer availability was briefly impacted for stapling but has since recovered, and we're working on bringing customer stocking levels back to their prior levels. For our Ion catheters and our multiport accessories, we're investing in capabilities to increase yield and robustness in the face of rising demand. We have worked through the issues that drove the bulk of these scrap charges in the quarter.\nFinally, in SG&A and R&D, we're spending roughly to plan while continuing to pursue productivity improvements post-pandemic. Jamie and Brian will take you through our finances and forward outlook in more detail shortly.\nOn new products and indications, we've had a productive quarter. We received our CE mark for Ion, and we expect to launch in the U.K. as our first entry into the European region. As we focus on scaling Ion, we initiated our first high-volume production lines in our Mexicali facility, increasing production volume 50% over just the prior quarter.\nIn digital, our simulation subscription installed base grew 36% year-over-year as virtual reality training becomes more deeply embedded in the training pathway. Our intuitive hub installed base grew 41% year-over-year and utilization during da Vinci cases grew 80% year-over-year as customers use our Intuitive Hub computing system to record and analyze procedures more routinely.\nTurning to SP. We received new indications for SP in the United States through a 510(k) clearance in urology, covering simple prostatectomy, removal of a noncancerous prostate for treatment of advanced benign prostate hyperplasia. We also installed our first da Vinci SP system in Japan, and they completed their first set of cases.\nFor 2023, our priorities are as follows. First, we're focused on increased adoption for our priority procedures in countries through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution. Second, we're pursuing expanded indications and launches for our new platforms. Third, we're focused on excellence and continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we're pursuing increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale. You can see from our first quarter results the relevance of these priorities and our urgency in pursuing them.\nI'll now turn the time over to Jamie who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nVP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\nBefore I dive into the details of our Q1 results, I will expand on the 2 areas of note in the quarter, and as Gary highlighted, procedure growth and gross margin.\nGlobal procedure growth in Q1 of 26% came in well above our expectations with notable strength in the U.S. where procedures also grew by 26%. As a reminder, procedures in Q1 of last year reflected an adverse impact from COVID in the early part of the quarter in the U.S. and the latter part of the quarter in Korea and China. We believe that the return of patients to normalized health care routines, including diagnostics, and improved staffing levels have positively impacted this quarter's procedures. However, it is difficult to precisely characterize or estimate the degree or duration of this impact.\nLooking at the monthly trends in the U.S., January and February were particularly strong relative to historical seasonality. However, in March, we saw more normalized growth rates. Outside of the U.S. procedure growth of almost 28% was also ahead of our expectations, with growth outperforming expectations across all our major international markets.\nIn the first quarter, non-urology procedures represented roughly half of our total OUS procedures and grew 35% from quarter 1 of last year. Brian will provide additional commentary and our updated procedure outlook later in the call.\nPro forma gross margin in Q1 was below our expectations at 67.2%, lower than last quarter's 68.2% and last year's 69.8%. Q1 results reflected onetime adverse impacts of approximately 100 basis points relating to manufacturing-related issues and an increase in inventory reserves, as Gary detailed. While we largely resolved these onetime items in the quarter, we see opportunity to strengthen our manufacturing operations and improve product costs. This is a priority for our business unit and operations teams and aligns with our capital investment plans, as we described on last quarter's call.\nTurning to other key metrics. In Q1, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew 12% to almost 7,800 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew 13% year-over-year, significantly above long-term trends, driven by notable strength in procedure volumes in January and February and by an increasing mix of shorter-duration benign procedures in the U.S. While we do not expect this level of utilization growth to continue, we actively support our customers as they increase utilization of their da Vinci systems which, in turn, lowers their per procedure costs.\nWith respect to capital performance, we placed 312 systems in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, with notable strength in OUS markets. Current quarter placements were roughly even with the 311 systems we placed in the first quarter of last year. There were 67 trade-in transactions in the quarter as compared to 108 last year. Excluding trade-in transactions, net new system placements increased 21% over the first quarter of last year. As of the end of Q1, there are approximately 560 Sis remaining in the installed base, of which approximately 110 are in the U.S.\nQ1 revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 14%. On a constant currency basis, first quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 81% of total revenue and grew 21% over last year driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. Within I&A revenue for our advanced technology categories, stapler and energy, revenue grew a combined 26% over Q1 of last year.\nAdditional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. In the U.S., we placed 141 systems in the first quarter, lower than the 186 systems we placed last year, reflecting a decline of 51 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Outside the U.S., we placed 171 systems in Q1 compared with 125 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 101 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 18 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 19 into Japan and 9 into China in Q1 of last year. First quarter system placement performance in Europe included 32 placements in the U.K. driven by timing of the NHS budget period, which closes each year at the end of March. We placed 12 systems in India, a quarterly high for us, which, in part, stems from our recent procedure growth there. In Q1, procedures in India grew 55%, albeit from a relatively small base.\nReviewing the capital performance in the quarter, we do not expect the strength in U.K. and India to repeat in the remainder of the year. Customers, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, continue to be challenged by staffing, inflation, debt servicing costs and other financial pressures. And as a result, we expect customers to continue to be cautious in their overall capital spending.\nLeasing represented 42% of Q1 placements compared with 42% last quarter and 35% last year. We are increasingly seeing customers address system access and capital budget barriers by choosing our usage-based leasing models. The proportion of placements under this structure continue to increase, particularly in the U.S. As a result of this trend and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time.\nQ1 system average selling prices were $1.47 million as compared to $1.43 million last quarter. The sequential increase in system ASPs was primarily driven by a lower mix of trade-ins. We recognized $24 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $16 million in Q1 of 2022.\nda Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,780 compared with approximately $1,820 last quarter and $1,870 last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $40, and ordering patterns in China had a negative impact of approximately $50 per procedure as our channel partners continue to manage their inventory levels in a dynamic environment. On a sequential basis, the primary driver of the decline in I&A per procedure of $40 was customer ordering patterns in the U.S.\nTurning to our Ion platform. In Q1, we placed 55 Ion systems as compared to 34 in Q1 of 2022. First quarter Ion procedures of approximately 10,200 increased 159% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we received CE mark clearance for our Ion platform in Europe where we will initially focus on the U.K. market and on the collection of clinical data in support of our European reimbursement strategy. Regulatory processes for Ion continue to progress in Korea and China. Ten of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, including our first placement in Japan following clearance last quarter. SP procedures grew by 37% and average system utilization increased by 12% compared to Q1 of last year.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. As previously referenced, pro forma gross margin for Q1 was 67.2%. And in addition to the onetime impacts described earlier, pro forma gross margin reflects the impact of higher component and labor costs and, relative to the year-ago period, a stronger U.S. dollar. Gross margin for our Ion platform is currently considerably below our da Vinci business, resulting in an adverse mix impact to gross margin given the higher growth rates of our Ion business. The key area of focus for our Ion and manufacturing teams over the next 18 months is to improve supply stresses, strengthen manufacturing capabilities and lower our product costs.\nI&A prices have remained the same for the life of Xi. However, given the durability of component cost increases throughout the pandemic, we are executing an increase to the list price of da Vinci I&A from approximately 5% over the next couple of months. This increase reflects only a portion of the increased component labor costs reflected in our gross margin. We expect the impact of this decision to be an increase in revenue and operating profit of approximately $100 million in 2023.\nFirst quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 20% year-over-year driven primarily by increased head count added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, higher travel costs and increased expenses associated with customer training. Operating expenses were moderately above our expectations due to higher variable compensation and training costs related to our procedure performance in the quarter. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up 1%, including the annual reset of certain payroll taxes. Head count increased by approximately 330 in Q1, of which roughly half are in support of revenue growth.\nCapital expenditures in Q1 were $197 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity, including automation of certain production lines.\nOur pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.1%, consistent with our expectations. First quarter pro forma net income was $437 million or $1.23 per share compared with $413 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of last year.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $355 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $366 million and also $1 per share for the first quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on strategic investments.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.6 billion compared with $6.7 billion at the end of last year. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures partially offset by cash from operating activities.\nDuring the quarter, we spent $350 million to repurchase 1.5 million of our shares at an average price of $230 per share. From the beginning of 2022 through the end of Q1 this year, we have repurchased 12.6 million shares at an average price of $234 per share and have $1.1 billion remaining under current Board authorization to repurchase our shares.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Jamie. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 26% year-over-year compared to 19% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. In the U.S., first quarter 2023 procedure growth was 26% year-over-year compared to 16% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. Q1 growth continued to be driven by strong growth in procedures within general surgery. Specifically, growth was led by cholecystectomy, bariatrics, hernia repair and other procedures.\nOutside of the U.S., first quarter procedure volume grew 28% compared with 25% for the first quarter of 2022 and 18% last quarter. First quarter 2023 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in general surgery and gynecology categories, primarily from colon resection and hysterectomy. Growth in urology continued to be solid led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy.\nIn Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., Germany, Italy and France. In all the regions noted, procedure growth was driven by strong growth in colorectal and hysterectomy. Urology was also solid, with particular strength in kidney procedures. Outside of those procedures, in Germany, we also saw strong growth in hernia repair. And in France, growth in lung resection was also strong.\nIn Asia, growth beyond urology was also led by general surgery and gynecology procedures. In Japan, growth was led by colon resection, a newly reimbursed procedure in 2022 that provided the most incremental cases this quarter. Growth was also robust in rectal resection and gastrectomy and continued early-stage growth in kidney procedures. In China, procedures started to recover in February from the impact of COVID, exceeding our expectations for the quarter but still below prior averages. Growth in urology was solid, in particular with growth in prostatectomy and kidney procedures.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.\nStarting with the clinical study for benign general surgery, Dr. Courtney Collins from Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center published outcomes comparing robotic versus open retromuscular ventral hernia repairs in older adults using prospectively collected data from the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative, a national hernia-specific registry.\nPublished in the Annals of Surgery, over 1,100 patients over the age of 65 were included in a propensity matched analysis, with 350 patients in the robotic arm and approximately 750 patients in the open arm. This study reported the median length of stay associated with the robotic-assisted approach was 1/4 of the length of stay for patients undergoing an open repair, with a 1-day stay in the robotic-assisted arm and a 4-day stay in the open arm.\nWhile complication rates were similar between both groups, it was notable that median 1-year quality-of-life scores using the HerQLes quality-of-life survey tool trended favorably for patients in the robotic-assisted arm. The authors concluded, in part, that the results suggest that robotic approach may have at least short-term benefits to appropriate older patients undergoing retromuscular ventral hernia repair, including shorter length of stay with relatively low risk of complications, with the important note that surgeon comfort and knowledge of the likely complexity of a repair should always guide operative approach in any patient.\nNow turning to a report published in January of this year. Dr. Sameh Emile from the Cleveland Clinic Florida reported outcomes for robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic resection of T4 rectal cancer in the British Journal of Surgery. This study, leveraging data from the National Cancer Database and after a 1:1 propensity score matching, compared 470 patients undergoing a minimally invasive resection for nonmetastatic T4 rectal cancer, with 235 subjects in each of the laparoscopic and robotic-assisted cohorts.\nNotably, rates of conversions in the robotic-assisted group were approximately half the rate of conversion in the laparoscopic group, with 8.9% in the robotic group versus 17.9% in the laparoscope group. Further analysis demonstrated that risk of conversion to open was 45% lower in the robotic-assisted group when compared to the laparoscopic group. In addition, patients who underwent a robotic-assisted procedure had a 1 day shorter length of stay compared to patients in the laparoscopic arm. The authors concluded, in part, that robotic-assisted resections of T4 rectal cancer were associated with a significantly lower conversion rate and shorter hospital stay than laparoscopic surgery.\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 18% to 21%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic and macroeconomic risks.\nThe low end of the range still assumes continued choppiness with COVID hospitalizations, uncertainty with the timing of the capital quota in China for the remainder of the year, macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending and a moderation in procedures from elevated levels experienced in January and February this year.\nAt the high end of the range, we assume COVID-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout 2023, a capital quota in China is available and macroeconomic challenges do not impact hospital procedure volumes. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic.\nTurning to gross profit. We continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.\nWith respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 9% and 13%. We are increasing our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. The increased operating expense growth reflects higher variable compensation and other costs related to higher procedure growth performance.\nWe are also updating our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $600 million to $630 million in 2023, a decrease from our previous estimate of $610 million to $640 million. We continue to expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $140 million and $160 million in 2023. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $800 million to $1 billion for planned facility construction activities.\nWith regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income.\nThat concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Quarter 4 2022 Earnings Release. (Operator Instructions). And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Brian King, please go ahead.\n\nBrian King\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2022, and Form 10-Q filed on October 21, 2022. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session.\nGary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results. Then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in Q4 and for the full year 2022. Procedure growth for the full year approached pre-pandemic levels, installed base growth was solid, and customers concurrently increased utilization of existing systems. Our investments in product development extended our multiport, single-port and flexible robotics ecosystems through new instrument accessories, digital products and indication expansions. Finally, the fine work of our operations teams and supply partners largely mitigated the supply chain challenges that persisted through the year.\nTurning first to procedures. We saw 18% procedure growth for the quarter and the full year. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States, particularly benign procedures such as bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth also continued. Strong growth beyond urology outside the U.S. was accretive to our global performance. We attribute this diversification to the value of our ecosystems and our strategic investments in organization, clinical trials, data products and market access. Regionally, the United States, Japan, Europe and India stood out in the quarter and year.\nProcedure growth in China was hampered by the COVID wave in Q4 with procedures progressively declining starting in November through the end of '22. Ion procedures showed continued strength with 218% growth in '22 compared with '21, and SP procedures grew 38% over the same period, with the majority of its growth coming from Korea. Global core procedure areas of urology and gynecology moved toward recovery in the year, both exceeding their 3-year compound annual growth rates in '22. On the capital front, we placed 369 systems in Q4 compared with 385 in Q4 2021. For the full year, we placed 1,264 systems compared with 1,347 in '21. Our installed base growth rate was 12% for multiport, 149% for Ion and 22% for SP in 2022.\nOverall, our capital placement trends showed sustained demand for additional capacity in multiport and strong interest in expanding capacity for Ion with several hospitals now operating multiple Ion systems in their programs and variable demand for SP as we continue to pursue our additional indications. System utilization is an important predictor of future demand and utilization grew 5% for multiport in the year and 10% for Ion. Utilization was roughly flat for SP over the year, however, utilization increased by 9% in Q4 measured year-over-year as our organization incorporated learnings.\nTouching on our finances, revenue grew 9% in 2022. Revenue was impacted by the strength of the dollar in the year and the decline of the trade-in population of third-generation multiport systems. Our expenses landed at the higher end of our spend guidance reflecting continued R&D investments that support the growth of our platforms and digital products, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial capabilities and capital amortization driven by expansion of our global footprint.\nStructurally, we have been increasing our own capital expenditures as we continue to build the company to supply the globe at industrial scale. This is an important investment as several procedures using our systems have become the standard of care in several countries. We have been vertically integrating key technologies to develop a more robust supply chain and bring important products to market at attractive price points. These investments include increased ownership of our imaging pipelines, strategic instrument and accessory technologies and software and digital products that allow us to serve our customers.\nThe investments make our business more capital intensive than years past, in support of industrial dependability, a more robust supply chain and lower product costs. I'd also like to take a moment to walk through our platform investments. Intuitive starts with the end in mind. Coordinating our efforts to enable our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim in specific procedures, for example, those in general surgery. We design all our systems to allow for the addition of new functionality over time. For our multiport platform, this design philosophy has enabled us to continuously strengthen our fourth-generation da Vinci Xi by adding new regulatory clearances, a new model with the da Vinci X, new instruments and accessories, new imaging capabilities and new software products.\nThese products include our stapling lot of instruments as well as our advanced energy instruments, which contributed approximately $890 million in revenue in '22 with revenue growth of 18% in the year and are a key enabler of the general surgery growth discussed a minute ago. We added 65 representative clinical procedure indications in the United States to our fourth-generation multiport platform since its launch. Our multiport indications now spans 6 surgical categories and total over 70 procedure indications for multiport platforms in the United States today.\nWe routinely improve our platform operating systems with roughly 10 significant fourth-generation OS releases since launch and dozens of smaller software upgrades. We launched our next-generation Xi visualization, Endoscope Plus, and have been integrating digital products, including virtual reality training Intuitive Hub and the My Intuitive app. We expect to launch additional Gen 4 compatible products and operating system software this year. Concurrently, we invest in new generations of our multiport platform that bring new and significantly enhanced capabilities. For our multiport system development programs, we prioritize as follows: our highest priority is the improvement of core surgical capability targeting improved patient outcomes, often through innovation in robot and instrument precision, imaging and sensing while focusing on dependability and product quality. Next, we designed to improve usability, care team's skill acquisition and analytic power, including digital products for the operating room, personalized learning for care teams and efficiency analysis and services for surgical programs.\nNext, we designed platforms and their ecosystems that can lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. And finally, we designed with the flexibility to add future capability to systems post launch. Given the time required to design and validate new architectures at any given moment, we're typically developing more than 1 system architecture beyond that in the market.\nIn the current global regulatory environment, core technology changes often require human clinical trials and substantial review. These are multiyear investment cycles, and we're making good progress. As we start this year, we do not currently expect a new multiport system launch in 2023.\nTurning to Ion. Adoption has been healthy based on its ability to meet an unmet clinical need in lung biopsy. We're focused on improving the manufacturability, cost and robustness of Ion products to support its rapid growth in the U.S. We have also submitted a regulatory dossier for a review in Europe, Korea and in China's green channel. We expect clearance in Europe in 2023. We don't have a firm forecast on the time for Ion clearance in China at this time given pandemic-related adjustments ongoing in the Chinese health care system.\nIon is also a platform with strong opportunities for future clinical applications. We're conducting advanced development and clinical research to extend Ion into other indications in the lung. While our Ion flexible robotics offers an opportunity to provide value in the body outside the lung, our focus is on completing what we started for pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons.\nOur single-port platform, da Vinci SP, has supported strong adoption in Korea and has recently obtained PMDA clearance with broad indications in Japan. We expect first installs of SP in Japan in the coming months. Next, we plan to submit our dossier on da Vinci SP to our notified body in Europe midyear 2023. So far, customer feedback on the clinical utility for SP has been healthy with strong multi-specialty use of SP in Korea.\nIn the United States, some indications have required prospective clinical trials, and we're currently conducting IDE trials in colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. We're pursuing additional indications for SP beyond these 2, and we'll share more information on these indications in 2023 as the requirements for our regulatory pathway for them are established. We're continuing to invest significant resources in R&D, where the portfolio we have under development positioned to support leadership in existing categories and expansion into new ones. Our capital investments will increase to support supply chain robustness, product cost reduction and global industrial scale.\nOn the SG&A front, we are making some foundational investments, and we'll turn to pursue leverage in enabling functions. Recognizing economic conditions for 2023 are hard to forecast, we're targeting a deceleration of fixed cost growth rate in '23 relative to '22. We expect pro forma operating margins to fluctuate in the next several quarters and then improve over the midterm.\nIn closing, our priorities for 2023 are as follows: first, increased adoption and focused procedures defined by country through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution; second, pursuit of expanded indications and launches for our new platforms; third, excellent performance in the continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses; and finally, pursuit of increased productivity and our functions that benefit from scale.\nI'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\nQ4 and 2022 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 11. I will briefly review full year 2022 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2022 procedures grew by 18% as compared to 2021 or 15% on a 3-year compound annual growth rate basis. During the year, we placed 1,264 systems at customers, down 6% year-over-year, driven by a decline in trading volumes of 165 systems due to the declining population of SIs in the field. Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products represented 79% of total revenue and grew 15% over the prior year. Total revenue of $6.2 billion increased 9% year-over-year and grew approximately 12% on a constant currency basis.\nPro forma operating margin was 35% of revenue and reflected the impact of several headwinds, FX, supply chain challenges and inflation together adversely impacted 2022 pro forma operating margin by approximately 1 percentage point. During the year, we repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock or approximately 11.2 million shares, and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.5 billion.\nTurning to Q4. With respect to capital performance, we placed 369 systems, 4% lower than the 385 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. There were 110 trading transactions in the quarter as compared to 117 last year. 51 of the 110 trading transactions were with OUS customers higher than recent trends primarily driven by customers in Japan and Brazil. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 620 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 134 are in the U.S.\nGiven the continuing decline of older generation systems in the field, we expect trade-in volumes to decline significantly in 2023. Q4 revenue was $1.66 billion, an increase of 7% from last year. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter revenue grew approximately 10%. For full year 2022, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 24% of total revenue. The U.S. dollar has weakened recently, and as a result, on a revenue-weighted basis using current rates, the U.S. dollar is approximately 100 basis points stronger than the average rates realized in 2022. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 181 systems in the fourth quarter, lower than the 235 systems we placed last year, reflecting cautious capital spending by customers given the macroeconomic environment and a decline of 21 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Average system utilization in the U.S. increased by 6%, reaching an all-time high. Outside the U.S. we placed 188 systems in Q4 compared with 150 systems last year.\nCurrent quarter system placements included 70 into Europe, 51 into Japan and 14 into China compared with 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan and 14 into China in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of the end of 2022, there were 34 systems remaining under the current quota in China. There are now 4 local competitors that are registered in China and they're active in tenders under the existing quota. Delays in the granting of a new quota in China will constrain our ability to further grow the installed base and limit capacity for procedure growth. Leasing represented 42% of Q4 placements compared with 37% last quarter and last year. The higher lease mix was primarily driven by the mix of customers in the U.S., who prefer to lease and reflected in part an increase in placements acquired under usage-based arrangements. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time.\nQ4 system average selling prices were $1.43 million as compared to $1.45 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by FX, partially offset by a favorable regional mix and a higher mix of Xi jewel placements. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $26 million in Q4 of 2021. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,820 compared with approximately $1,800 last quarter and $1,940 last year.\nOn a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $50 and customer ordering patterns had a negative impact of approximately $40 per procedure as customers, particularly in the U.S. and China, reduced their inventory levels.\nTurning to our Ion platform. In 2022, we tripled procedures to just over 23,000 and doubled system placements to 192 as compared to 2021. In Q4, we placed 67 Ion systems as compared to 31 in Q4 of 2021. The installed base of Ion systems is now 321 systems, of which 132 are under operating lease arrangements. Fourth quarter Ion procedures of approximately 7,900 increased 169% as compared to last year. Leveraging previous investments we have made in our da Vinci ecosystem during the quarter, we commenced the launch of My Intuitive app for Ion users, providing them real-time access and insights to their Ion usage statistics.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 68.2% compared with 70.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. As a reminder, last quarter's gross margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to increased fixed costs relative to revenue, the stronger U.S. dollar and higher component pricing. The supply chain environment was challenging in Q4 and indicators of supply and inventory health did not improve as compared to last quarter. Higher fixed costs relative to revenue reflect a combination of manufacturing-related inefficiencies given the environment and investments for future growth.\nFourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount, higher travel costs, increased customer training activities and higher R&D-related project costs. Fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, which can support their efforts for the next couple of years and did not repeat in 2022. The pace at which we are increasing headcount continued to moderate in Q4 with net additions of about 330 employees in the quarter compared to a net increase of approximately 530 employees last quarter. More than half of the employees we added in Q4 were production staff in our instrument factory in Mexico to support procedure growth. While we are slowing our hiring pace and pursuing leverage in our enabling functions, we are planning for balanced growth in operating expenses in 2023 given the opportunity to advance our next-generation robotics capabilities and the relatively earlier stage of our investments in Ion, SP and digital.\nIn 2023, we expect a significant increase in expenses related to clinical trials. Brian will provide our outlook for operating expenses later in this call. As we look forward to our growth plans over the next several years, we are planning to make significant capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2022 were $532 million, and we expect 2023 capital expenditures in a range of $800 million to $1 billion, of which approximately 2/3 will be for facilities to expand our manufacturing capacity. Our manufacturing investment plans include advanced proprietary facilities for production of new products and the Ion platform in California and da Vinci systems in Georgia.\nInternationally, we are increasing our product development capacity in Germany, building a new low-cost endoscope manufacturing facility in Bulgaria and establishing manufacturing capacity for domestic Xi production in China. We will also be expanding the footprint of our high-volume, low-cost instrument site in Mexico to support procedure growth across all of our platforms. These investments allow us to consolidate our manufacturing into larger centralized hubs, such as our headquarter campus in Sunnyvale, California and our East Coast hub just outside of Atlanta, while we will co-locate surgeon training, technology development and manufacturing capacity. These are multiyear investments. And as a result, we expect depreciation expense to increase in 2023 and increase more significantly in 2024.\nPro forma other income was $21.8 million for Q4, higher than $7.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses from remeasurement of the balance sheet and higher interest income. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2% lower than prior quarters, primarily as a result of a more favorable geographical earnings mix and a discrete tax benefit of $7 million associated with the foreign tax matter. Fourth quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $439 million or $1.23 per share compared with $473 million or $1.29 per share for the fourth quarter of last year.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the year with cash and investments of $6.7 billion compared with $7.4 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases of $1 billion and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2023.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for the full year 2022 was 18% and increased 15% on a 3-year compound annual growth basis. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 16% growth in the U.S. and 22% growth outside of the U.S. In the U.S., fourth quarter 2022 procedures grew 18% year-over-year compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 18% last quarter. The U.S. procedure growth rate reflected a favorable comparison to the quarter a year ago, given the impact of the Omicron variant in December of last year.\nOn a 3-year compound annual growth basis, U.S. procedure growth was 13%. Outside of the U.S., fourth quarter procedure volume grew approximately 18% year-over-year compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 24% last quarter. On a 3-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 19%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth in the quarter was led by strong growth in U.K., Germany and Italy. In the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in the U.K., we experienced strong early-stage growth in colorectal surgery and continued strong growth in hysterectomy.\nTurning to Asia. Growth outside of China continued to be solid with notable strength in capital and procedure growth in Japan. Procedure growth in Korea was healthy and India and Taiwan continue to experience strong early-stage growth. In Japan, as Jamie noted earlier, 51 systems were placed in the country, the most in a single quarter. Overall procedure growth in Japan for the quarter was led by general surgery with strong early stage growth in colon resection and cystectomy and also in urology with newly reimbursed nephrectomy procedures.\nIn China, midway through the fourth quarter, we observed the decline in procedures. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw a significant decline in procedure volume as hospitals were dealing with increasing COVID cases once the Zero-COVID policy was removed. As a result, China procedures experienced a modest year-over-year decline in Q4.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. While still in the early stages of adoption in the U.S., robotic-assisted bariatric surgery has been one of the fastest-growing procedures in general surgery for Intuitive. In October 2022, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders released major updates to the 1991 National Institute of Health guidelines that recommended lowering the BMI for metabolic and bariatric surgery, or MBS, from 40 to 35, regardless of the presence, absence or severity of comorbidities. These guidelines note that, \"MBS is now preferably performed using minimally invasive surgical approaches, laparoscopic or robotic.\" \"MBS is the most effective evidence-based treatment for obesity across all BMI classes.\"\nIn another bariatric analysis, Dr. Wayne Barley from St. Luke's University Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, recently published a descriptive analysis from the NBA SIP database identifying the proportion of MBS procedures in the U.S. performed between 2015 and 2020. Using a robotic or laparoscopic approach and found up to a threefold difference in the proportion of various robotic-assisted MBS cases per year. We believe our investments in advanced instruments and surgeon training are helping to drive adoption of robotic-assisted surgery in bariatrics. We look forward to continuing to support surgeons and their care teams as they provide high-quality robotic minimally invasive care for an even greater portion of the population under the new guidelines.\nA recent rectal cancer study by Dr. Fang from Fudan University in Shanghai and on behalf of the Real Study Group, published short-term outcomes from a multicenter randomized controlled trial (inaudible). This study impaired robotic-assisted and laparoscopic approaches performed by experienced surgeons for middle and low rectal cancer across 11 hospitals in China, with approximately 580 cases included in each approach.\nWith respect to perioperative outcomes, the rate of patients with a positive circumferential margin was 3.2% lower in the robotic-assisted group as well as a 3.6% higher rate of complete macroscopic resection. Furthermore, patients in the laparoscopic arm experienced a 2.2% higher rate of conversion to open. A 3.3% higher rate of intraoperative complications was also reported in the laparoscopic group. Notably, 5.8% less abdominal perineal resections were performed in the robotic group. Postoperatively, patients in the robotic-assisted arm also had a faster gastrointestinal recovery postoperatively as well as a 1 day shorter length of stay an approximately 7% lower rate of postoperative complications with the (inaudible) grade of 2 or higher.\nIn summary, the authors concluded that short-term outcomes suggests that for middle and low rectal cancer Robotic surgery by experienced surgeons resulted in better quality resection than conventional laparoscopic surgery with less surgical trauma and better postoperative recovery. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. For 2023, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. The low end of the range assumes continued choppiness with COVID hospitalizations and staffing pressure at hospitals globally throughout the year. In addition, it assumes ongoing staffing, significant challenges with COVID in China and uncertainty with the timing of the new capital quota. At the high end of the range, we assume no new significant impact from COVID throughout 2023, and assume continued growth in general surgery in the U.S. and diversified growth beyond urology outside of the U.S.\nThe range does not reflect significant material, supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic. Beyond the uncertainty with COVID in China, we expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2023 as we have experienced before the pandemic, with the first quarter being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity.\nCapital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including national health care policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2022 pro forma gross profit margin was 69.2%. In 2023, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2023 reflects the impact of higher infrastructure investment costs, higher supply chain costs, and a greater mix of new products, in particular, from our Ion platform.\nOur actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, procedure mix and volumes fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the potential impact of competitive pricing. Turning to operating expenses. In 2022, our pro forma operating expenses grew 23%. In 2023, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 9% and 13%. The operating expense growth reflects investments to advance our platform capabilities, digital products, along with continued expansion into markets outside of the U.S. and spending to support regulatory clearances and clinical trials. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $610 million to $640 million in 2023. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $140 million and $160 million in 2023. With regard to income tax, in 2022, our pro forma income tax rate was 21.8%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income.\nThat concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

Welcome to the Intuitive Third Quarter Earnings Release Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Brian King. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian King\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's third quarter earnings conference call.\nWith me today we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2022, and Form 10-Q filed on July 22, 2022. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.\nToday's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today.\nOur business fundamentals strengthened in Q3 with 20% procedure growth in da Vinci procedures compared with Q3 of last year and solid performance in each of our global regions. Our capital placements reflected 13% growth in our installed base to meet procedure demand accompanied by continued increases in utilization per system per year, healthy indicators for our customers and for us. Ion also experienced increases in installs, procedures performed and annualized system utilization. Supply chain challenges while still present, are abating from their pandemic peaks.\nLooking more closely at procedures, 20% growth is up from 14% last quarter and above our 3-year compound annual growth rate of 16% during the pandemic. General surgery, our largest procedure category is growing at the fastest rate of any category fueled by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and other foregut procedures in the United States.\nIn Europe, several countries are growing nicely with diversified use beyond urology. Germany, the U.K. and Ireland, Italy and Spain stood out in the quarter.\nIn Asia, Japanese procedure growth accelerated relative to Q2 and Korean growth remained solid. Procedures in both countries are also diversifying beyond urology. In China, procedure growth was just above our global average, hampered in part by regional rolling lockdowns that continue to impact procedures and utilization.\nTurning to capital. We placed 305 systems in the quarter compared with 336 in Q3 a year ago and 279 last quarter. Strong procedure demand is supporting da Vinci installed base growth of 13% in the quarter. Per system utilization grew 7% in the quarter, up from our 3-year compound annual growth of 5% over the pandemic. Utilization was aided by recovery from a softer U.S. procedure quarter last year as well as customer performance of more types of procedures and higher volume categories and increases in customer efficiency.\nSi trade-ins continued to slow given the decline in remaining trade-in opportunity. Ion placements grew to 50 this quarter, up from 28 last year and 41 last quarter, reflecting continued growth in an early market. Overall, our customers are acquiring systems where there is opportunity for procedure growth.\nOn the investment front, we continue to focus on our platforms in multiport endoluminal, single port and digital through indication and regional regulatory expansions, innovation in products and services that meet customer needs and product quality and cost refinements. We expect our new platforms to approach our historical levels of contribution margin over time. Progress year-to-date has met our expectations.\nWith regard to our expenses this quarter, we moderated headcount growth to focus on deeply integrating those employees who joined us in the past several quarters. Going into 2023, we expect the rate of growth in fixed expenses to slow as we pursue leverage in our enabling functions and sequence some of our forward investments.\nWe've had a solid quarter achieving product and services milestones. We continue to expand access to our multiport products, training and services globally. Standouts in the quarter include record global quarterly new surgeon training completions to first case and accreditation of our technology training pathway by the Royal College of Surgeons in the U.K.\nFor Ion, we submitted our registration application in China, and we obtained German regulatory clinical study approval for ion ablation technology, which starts our clinical journey towards enabling interventions beyond biopsy. Ion procedures grew 211% in the quarter.\nTurning to our single-port platform, da Vinci SP. Procedures grew 46% year-over-year, with particular strength in Korea, where our SP team launched next-generation SP instruments and our Firefly-enabled endoscope. We also received PMDA clearance in the quarter, market SP in Japan across a broad set of clinical indications similar to the indications SP has in Korea.\nIn our digital portfolio, our My Intuitive app and PORTaL are being adopted broadly in regions in which they are released as the go-to digital portal for da Vinci customers. Installs of our in-room computing platform, Intuitive Hub grew 21% over the third quarter last year and software updates to our hub installed base improved usability and enabled telepresence.\nIn summary, our core business strengthened in the quarter as acute pandemic impact softened. We are managing spend growth while investing in core growth opportunities for the future.\nI'll now pass the time over to Jamie to take us through our finances and some persistent macroeconomic issues in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon.\nI will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\nIn Q3, growth in procedures, the installed base of da Vinci systems and average system utilization was healthy. The strength of these key business drivers resulted in a pro forma operating margin of 36% and pro forma EPS of $1.19.\nSimultaneously, we saw headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar, lingering supply chain issues and inflation, which together negatively impacted pro forma operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year. I will take you through these details.\nQ3 procedure growth of 20% reflected an increase in U.S. procedures of 18% and OUS procedure growth of 24%. U.S. procedure growth reflected a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter given the impact of the Delta variant last year. On a 3-year compound annual growth rate basis, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13%.\nIn China, our second largest market during the quarter, procedures continued to recover from the impact of COVID-related lockdowns that we described on last quarter's earnings call. However, we continue to see regional lockdowns occur as COVID cases rise.\nTurning to capital. We placed 305 systems in the third quarter, 9% lower than the 336 systems we placed last year. Third quarter system placements included approximately 15 systems that were delayed at the end of last quarter due to component supply delays.\nThere were 71 trading transactions in the quarter as compared to 136 in Q3 of 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of Si remaining in the installed base. As of the end of Q3, there were approximately 739 Sis remaining in the installed base, of which 191 are in the U.S.\nExcluding trading transactions, global system placements grew 17% from last year. The installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 13% year-over-year, consistent with recent trends. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased almost 7% compared to last year. Using a 3-year compound annual growth rate, third quarter utilization was consistent with historical averages, increasing almost 5%.\nAverage system utilization in the U.S. grew 6% year-over-year, an improvement from the 1% decline in utilization in Q2. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q3 revenue was $1.56 billion, an increase of 11% from the third quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue grew approximately 15%.\nIn the third quarter, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 22% of total revenue. On a revenue-weighted basis, using current exchange rates, net of hedges in place for Q4, the U.S. dollar is approximately 3% stronger than the rates realized in Q3. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: In the U.S., we placed 175 systems in the third quarter, lower than the 227 in Q3 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 66 systems associated with trade-in transactions and a challenging macroeconomic environment. Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the third quarter compared with 109 last year. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 32 into Japan and 14 into China compared with 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan and 17 into China in the third quarter of 2021.\nAs of the end of Q3 2022, there were 40 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which is also available to the 3 domestic competitors that have completed local registration with NMPA. Markets that are served through distributors have represented approximately 10% of system placements so far this year. Our distribution partners purchased product from us in U.S. dollars and sell in their local currencies. While we have not experienced a significant impact so far, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduces distributor margins and may cause delays in capital purchases.\nLeasing represented 37% of Q3 placements compared with 42% last quarter and 41% in the third quarter of 2021. The lower lease mix is a function of customer and regional mix. And while leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time.\nThird quarter system average selling prices were $1.5 million, consistent with last quarter. System ASPs were negatively impacted by a higher trade-in mix and the impact of FX, offset by a higher mix of Xi dual console placements. We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $22 million last quarter and $25 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so.\nInstrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800 compared with approximately $1,900 for both last quarter and last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&A per procedure by approximately $50. The remainder of the year-over-year reduction was primarily a result of customer ordering patterns. During the quarter, our distributors and customers in certain OUS markets reduced their inventory as supply chain predictability moderately improved.\nWe placed 50 Ion systems in the quarter as compared to 28 in the third quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 254 systems, of which 112 are under operating lease arrangements. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 6,400 increased 211% on a year-over-year basis. Ion is in the new MDR regulatory review process in Europe, and during the quarter, we submitted Ion into the regulatory process in China. As a reminder, regulatory review timelines in China are lengthy.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 69.8% compared with 71.3% for the third quarter of 2021 and 69.2% last quarter. Q3 pro forma gross margin included a onetime benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar, manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies as a result of the supply chain environment, higher component pricing and increased fixed costs relative to revenue. Indicators of supply and inventory held modestly improved in the quarter but remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Pro forma operating expenses increased 24% compared with third quarter of 2021, driven by increased headcount, higher R&D-related project costs and higher travel costs.\nGrowth in operating expenses has been primarily in support of our Ion platform, next-generation robotics capabilities, our digital capabilities and expansion of our infrastructure to allow us to effectively scale. We are also seeing higher regulatory costs as a result of increased regulatory requirements globally and expansion of our new platforms into OUS markets.\nAs Gary mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we slowed our hiring pace, adding approximately 530 employees lower than the 700-plus employees we have added per quarter in the last 3 quarters. As we look forward to 2023, we expect our operating expense growth will be lower than the growth for this year. The slowing growth rate of operating expenses reflects the completion of some of our infrastructure and business process improvement investments and planned leverage in our enabling functions.\nAs part of our planning process, we are also conducting a review of our capital expenditure priorities and we'll provide an update as to the outcome of this review on the next call. Within this framework, we will continue to invest in our new platforms, in NSP, next-generation capabilities and our digital ecosystem given the return profiles we see for those investments.\nPro forma other income was $7.2 million for Q3, lower than $10.4 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange losses from remeasurement of the balance sheet resulting from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.4%, in line with our expectations.\nThird quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $429 million or $1.19 per share compared with $435 million and also $1.19 per share for the third quarter of last year.\nCapital expenditures in Q3 were $153 million primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $324 million or $0.90 per share for the third quarter of 2022 compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.4 billion compared with $8.2 billion at the end of Q2. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we completed a $1 billion ASR in addition to the $607 million of shares repurchased in the first half.\nSince the end of 2021, our diluted share count has decreased by approximately 7 million shares or 2% and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $2.5 billion.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Jamie.\nOur overall third quarter 2022 procedure growth was 20% compared to 20% for the third quarter of 2021 and 14% last quarter. The 3-year compound annual growth rate between the third quarter of 2019 and third quarter of 2022 was 16%. In the U.S., third quarter 2022 procedures exceeded our expectations with growth at 18% year-over-year compared to 16% for the third quarter of 2021 and 11% last quarter.\nProcedure growth reflects a positive impact relative to Q3 last year, which was impacted by the Delta variant. On a 3-year compound annual growth basis, U.S. procedure growth was 13%. Third quarter procedure growth continued to be driven by general surgery with strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Trends in malignant procedures, namely colorectal and lobectomy procedures were also strong. Growth in gynecology, our second largest procedure category in the U.S., also experienced double-digit growth while more mature urologic procedures grew in the high single digits.\nOutside of the U.S., third quarter procedure volume grew approximately 24% year-over-year compared to 30% for the third quarter of 2021 and 22% last quarter. On a 3-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 21%.\nTurning to Europe. Procedure growth was led by strong growth in Germany, U.K., Italy and Spain. In all of the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in Germany, we experienced early stage growth in benign hysterectomy and colorectal surgery. In the U.K., growth was led by benign hysterectomy, colorectal and cholecystectomy procedures. While still early stage, year-over-year procedure growth in these non-urology procedures was almost 4x higher than urology.\nTurning to Asia. In Japan, growth in general surgery and gynecology continued to be strong. We experienced robust growth in these categories led by gastrectomy, rectal resection and benign hysterectomy. Further contributing to strong procedure performance was continued early-stage growth in newly reimbursed procedures, namely colon resection and nephrectomy procedures.\nIn China, we continue to see a recovery in the first couple of months of the third quarter as COVID cases began to decline and lockdown restrictions were lifted. Procedure growth was driven by urologic procedures, specifically prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy, along with strong growth in colon resection within general surgery. Later in the quarter, we began to see procedures start to moderate as COVID began to reemerge in various regions and rolling lockdowns were implemented.\nKorea procedure growth was also solid in the third quarter. Growth in procedures continued to be broad-based with strong growth in SP procedures.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.\nEarlier today at the Annual CHEST conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Dr. Eric Folk from Massachusetts General Hospital presented preliminary performance updates from the PRECIsE study. Results were consistent with data released last year and demonstrated encouraging results for diagnostic yield and sensitivity of malignancy for samples obtained through an Ion procedure with a strong safety profile. We anticipate the final data from PRECIsE to be published in the first part of next year.\nContinuing with Ion, a group from the Mayo Clinic in both Rochester, Minnesota and Jacksonville, Florida, led by doctors Alejandra Yu Lee-Mateus, Janani Reisenauer and Sebastian Fernandez-Bussy published a retrospective case series in respirology, comparing the performance of the Ion endoluminal system with the CT guided transthoracic approach for pulmonary lesion biopsy.\nA total of 225 patients were included in this study. 113 who underwent an Ion procedure with a median nodule size of 18 millimeters and 112 who underwent a transthoracic biopsy with a median nodule size of 16 millimeters. Within the Ion group, the overall diagnostic yield and sensitivity for malignancy reported was 87.6% and 82.1%, respectively, which were comparable to the same outcomes from the transthoracic approach.\nImportantly, the rate of complications was significantly lower for the Ion approach with a 13% difference relative to the transthoracic approach. Further analysis demonstrated an approximately 80% reduced chance of pneumothorax associated with the Ion procedure. The authors concluded in part that robotic-assisted approach with Ion can be as accurate as the transthoracic approach for sampling pulmonary nodules with similar or reduced complications and should be considered as a means for nodule biopsy.\nTurning to the surgical side. Dr. Leonardo (inaudible) from the University of Bologna and colleagues published a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic approaches for left colectomy procedures in the International Journal of Colorectal Disease. Data from 11 different articles, including over 52,000 patients were included in this analysis, with over 13,500 in the robotic arm and over 39,000 in the laparoscopic arm and with no difference in preoperative characteristics reported. With regard to perioperative outcomes, a 4% lower conversion to open rate was reported for the robotic-assisted approach compared to the laparoscopic approach.\nFurther analysis demonstrated the risk of conversion to open for the robotic-assisted approach was approximately half the rest of the laparoscopic approach. In addition, the analysis showed a higher risk of postoperative complications after a laparoscopic left colectomy, as well as a lower rate of superficial wound infections for the robotic-assisted approach.\nThe analysis also showed anastomotic leak was 30% less likely with the robotic-assisted approach compared to the lap group. The authors concluded in part that robotic left colectomy requires less conversion to open surgery than the standard laparoscopic approach and more studies are warranted to highlight possible advantages in using the robotic platform for left colectomy.\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 16.5%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 17% to 18%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range still assumes increasing COVID hospitalizations, regional lockdowns and staffing pressure at hospitals for the remainder of the year.\nAt the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout the remainder of 2022, and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we have experienced at the start of the pandemic.\nTurning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5%, expected to be towards the lower end of that range. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 69.5% of net revenue, given the ongoing impact of higher input costs related to supply chain and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on products, regional and trade-in mix, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the impact of new product introductions.\nWith respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 25%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 23%. We are narrowing our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $520 million to $530 million in 2022. We are also updating our estimate for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $40 million and $50 million in 2022, a decrease from our previous estimate of $60 million and $70 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest income on cash that was used to repurchase shares and also the net impact of certain foreign exchange gains and losses.\nOn last quarter's call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $800 million. We are now lowering our estimate for capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions.\nMaggie, I think we'd like to go ahead and lead the Q&A to the..."

Thank you for standing by as today's conference assembled. Welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Quarter 2 2022 earnings release. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations with Intuitive Surgical, Mr. Brian King. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you. So good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2022, and Form 10-Q filed on April 22, 2022. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today.\nOur Q2 results reflect both environmental and Intuitive's specific headwinds accompanied by underlying business strength. Procedures in the quarter grew 14% over last year despite pressure from COVID-driven lockdowns in China, our second largest market. Capital placements slowed from a year ago due to a combination of factors we described last quarter and which I will review shortly. Overall pressure from COVID lockdowns impacted procedures in the quarter modestly while reduced trade-ins and supply chain timing impacted our capital placements more significantly. The leading indicator of the health of our business, procedure demand, remains healthy.\nStarting first with procedures. I am encouraged by 14% growth in the quarter, reflecting strength in U.S. general surgery and solid growth extending beyond urology outside the United States. U.S. procedure growth was led by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and colorectal procedures with continued growth in hernia repair. In OUS markets, procedures grew 22% in the quarter in spite of the COVID lockdown in China.\nOutside the U.S., we are seeing strength in urology now accompanied by diversified growth in other procedures. For example, in Japan, growth was strong in general surgery, including rectal resection. In the U.K. and Ireland, growth was strong in gynecology and general surgery. And in France, gynecology and general surgery experienced solid growth. System utilization in several OUS countries has been increasing in recent quarters as procedure adoption diversifies increasing value for our customers and for Intuitive. This is a result of the investments we made in key country markets starting several years ago.\nTurning to da Vinci capital placements. We placed 279 systems in the quarter, down from 328 in Q2 2021. In the da Vinci business, we see 3 causes for the decline in placements relative to a year ago. As our customers have standardized on Generation 4 da Vinci systems, the installed base of third generation systems has declined, lowering the trade-in population, particularly in the United States.\nNext, supply chain disruption continued in the quarter with semiconductor component delays impacting the timing of system builds, leaving us challenged to match some customer orders at quarter end. Lastly, we've seen hospital capital spending pressure grow in our part of the capital equipment space over the past 2 quarters, incenting customers to seek efficiency gains on existing capital before acquiring new capacity. Component supply constraints remain a risk, and our operating teams are working hard to shelter our customers for most of these pressures.\nCapital placements in more mature markets are a mix of core demand for procedures and trade-in opportunities. The need for high-quality robotic-assisted surgery remains healthy. Incremental capital demand at the customer is a function of system utilization and procedure growth.\nOn the system utilization side, our compound annual growth rate remains at historic levels of 5% over the past 3-year period. System utilization in the U.S. over the past year was slightly down as procedure growth rate over the past year roughly matched the system installed base growth. In contrast, system utilization in many OUS markets, has been rising as procedures diversify. Overall, we prioritize system utilization growth for customers as it increases the value to them of their investments and is aligned with long-term health for Intuitive.\nTurning to our innovation engines and new products and services, we placed 41 Ion systems, up from 20 in Q2 of last year. Given its stage of maturity, Ion capital demand precedes procedure growth as hospitals seek to build initial capability. With the Ion clinical installed base now at 204 systems, Ion utilization has been growing nicely along with encouraging early capital placements.\nWe received 510(k) clearance for our integration of Ion with Siemens Cios Spin cone-beam CT. This combination improves registration and targeting precision for Ion in the lung and is being well received by our customers. We remain focused on strengthening clinical outcomes in lung care, a fantastic customer experience and operational excellence in the Ion program.\nIn our multiport ecosystem, we initiated our first phase U.S. launch of our 8-millimeter stapler designed to work in small anatomical spaces, for example, in thoracic surgery. Early customer feedback has been encouraging. In China, we're preparing to launch our SureForm 45- and 60-millimeter staplers and our latest endoscope, Endoscope Plus. All 3 will continue to support growth in general surgery and thoracic procedures.\nFor da Vinci SP, we have expanded the number of colorectal IDE sites to help accelerate accrual and we submitted another regulatory package for SP imaging and accessories in Japan as we work on the necessary clearances to support an SP launch in the country. For our digital tools, Intuitive Hub installs grew nicely again in the quarter, and we're focused on ensuring outstanding customer experiences with data capture and media management, along with increasing utilization over time.\nOn spending, we are committed to our innovation programs because we believe the forward opportunity for our products and services are important to our customers and to the company. We have some natural shock absorbers that decreased some of our variable spending as a result of the slowdown in da Vinci capital placements. We are also planning for decelerating spend growth after we complete some infrastructure projects we need to support the company's expansion. Given our confidence in the future of our business, we have also returned cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks in the quarter.\nI'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\nQ2 procedure growth of 14% reflected an increase in U.S. procedures of 11% and OUS procedure growth of 22%. As a reminder, procedures in the U.S. in the second quarter of last year included a recovery of procedures that were delayed as a result of the significant impact of the Omicron variants. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in the call.\nWe placed 279 systems in the second quarter as compared to 328 systems in the second quarter of 2021 and 311 systems last quarter. Q2 system placements were 15% lower than the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to a significant decline in trade-in transactions. There were 56 trade-in transactions in the quarter as compared to 125 in Q2 of 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of SIs remaining in the installed base.\nThe supply chain environment continues to be challenging. And during the quarter, we experienced delays in the supply of certain semiconductor components that caused manufacturing output da Vinci systems to be later in the quarter than historical norms. As a result, a number of systems that we would have expected to place in the latter part of June experienced minor delays and were shipped and installed in July.\nWe indicated on last quarter's call that we had experienced a softening in the U.S. capital pipeline. That softness persisted in Q2. Financial pressures have increased on hospitals, given higher inflation, increasing interest rates, supply chain challenges and continued staffing shortages. Some of the larger IDNs have indicated that as a consequence of the financial pressures they face, they are lowering their capital investment plans and tightening operational budgets.\nWe expect that demand for capital, particularly in the U.S., will be impacted while macro conditions remain challenging. Where a particular hospital requires additional da Vinci capacity, given growth in their programs, we will leverage our flexible acquisition models to meet the financial objectives of our customers.\nGiven the system placements in Q2, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 13% year-over-year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 1% compared to last year. Using a 3-year compound annual growth rate, second quarter utilization grew almost 5%, which is in line with historical averages.\nIn more mature markets like the U.S., capital demand is sensitive to procedure growth, and therefore, we monitor changes in system utilization closely. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q2 revenue was $1.52 billion, an increase of 4% from the second quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue grew approximately 6% over last year. It is worth highlighting that recurring revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $1.24 billion, representing 81% of total revenue.\nAdditional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 150 systems in the second quarter, lower than the 213 in Q2 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 59 systems associated with trade-in transactions, a softer demand environment and the delay of some system placements into July. The remaining installed base of Si Systems in the U.S. is approximately 230 systems.\nOutside the U.S., we placed 129 systems in the second quarter compared with 115 in the second quarter of 2021. Current quarter system placements included 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 15 into China, compared with 63 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 19 into China in the second quarter of 2021. As of the end of Q2 2022, there were 48 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which is also available to competitors that have received local regulatory clearance.\nGlobally, trade-in transactions represented 20% of placements in the quarter compared to 38% for full year 2021 and 48% for full year 2020. As we have previously indicated, given the lower number of older generation systems in the field, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to last year.\nLeasing represented 42% of Q2 placements compared with 35% last quarter and 33% in the second quarter of 2021. The higher lease mix primarily reflected an increase in the proportion of OUS customers that lease the system in the quarter versus purchased, driven in particular by customers in Europe. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time.\nSecond quarter system average selling prices were $1.50 million, slightly lower than the $1.54 million last quarter. Although system ASPs were roughly flat, lower trading volumes benefit Q2 ASP offset by an unfavorable impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and a higher mix of lower price X systems, primarily driven by customers in Europe.\nWe recognized $22 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $16 million last quarter and $26 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,900 per procedure compared with $1,870 last quarter and $1,940 in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q2 of 2021 associated with the launch of our extended use instruments program and an unfavorable FX impact from the stronger U.S. dollar.\nThe sequential increase reflects a higher proportion of stapling and advanced energy revenue. Revenue for these categories combined grew 22% as compared to the second quarter of last year. We placed 41 Ion systems in the quarter as compared to 20 Ion placements in the second quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 204 systems, of which 90 are under operating lease arrangements.\nSecond quarter Ion procedures of approximately 5,200 increased 251% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Ion is in the new MDR regulatory review process in Europe and our efforts to pursue a submission in China continue to make progress. Five of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, resulting in an installed base of 111. Second quarter SP procedures grew approximately 28% year-over-year.\nOne of the areas of potential clinical differentiation for SP is in narrow access surgery, for example, in transoral robotic surgical or TORS procedures. For malignant TORS procedures, based on the last 4 quarters, we estimate SP market share in the U.S. to be just under 20%. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 69.2% compared with 71.7% for the second quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. Pro forma gross margin was lower primarily as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, higher logistics costs, increased component pricing and increased fixed costs relative to revenue as we invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to serve our long-term needs.\nPro forma operating expenses increased 23% compared with the second quarter of 2021. The increase in second quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an increase in headcount, higher R&D-related project costs and higher travel costs, including the impact of inflation. Given the early stages of our newer platforms, Ion and SP and our digital ecosystem, we expect to continue to invest in R&D, given the return profile of these investments. Spending in SG&A will be more closely linked to our procedure and revenue performance, and we will continue to pursue plans to invest in infrastructure and business process automation to ensure we can efficiently and effectively scale.\nPro forma operating margin for Q2 was 35% as compared to 40% for the full year 2021. As compared to the second quarter of last year, the net impact of FX, inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the supply chain environment is a reduction in operating margin of approximately 2%. Our pro forma tax rate -- effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, in line with our expectations.\nSecond quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $415 million or $1.14 per share compared with $475 million or $1.30 per share for the second quarter of 2021. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $131 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint, increased manufacturing capacity and automation of certain production lines.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022 compared with GAAP net income of $517 million or $1.42 per share for the second quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.2 billion compared with $8.4 billion at the end of Q1. The sequential reduction in cash and investments primarily reflected share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent and are as follows: first, to organically invest in the business, given the significant opportunities we see to develop differentiated technology and drive adoption of our products. Second, to acquire external technology that creates value for our customers and/or accelerate development time lines or acquisitions that accelerate our growth. Third, we return excess cash to shareholders and look to do so efficiently.\nIn Q2, we repurchased 2.2 million of our shares at an average price of $224 per share for a total expenditure of $500 million. Concurrent with today's earnings release, our Board of Directors have improved an increase to the share repurchase authorization to $3.5 billion.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Jamie. Our overall second quarter 2022 procedure growth was 14% compared to 68% for the second quarter of 2021, which we believe benefited from a number of procedures which had previously been deferred due to COVID-19. The 3-year compound annual growth rate was 16% between the second quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2022. In the U.S., second quarter 2022 procedure growth was 11% year-over-year compared to 77% for the second quarter of 2021 and 16% last quarter. On a 3-year compound annual growth basis, U.S. procedure growth was 14%.\nQ2 procedure growth continued to be driven by general surgery, with particular strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and colorectal, while hernia and foregut were also strong contributors. Growth in mature urology and gynecology procedures also continue but at a moderate pace in the low single digits. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew approximately 22% compared with 51% for the second quarter of 2021 and 25% last quarter. Despite COVID-related restrictions in China, on a 3-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 20%.\nTurning to Europe. Procedure growth was led by strong growth in Italy, U.K. and Germany. In all 3 regions noted, procedure growth was strong in general surgery and gynecology. In Italy, growth in these procedures outside of urology was led by general surgery, specifically in colorectal and HPV procedures. In Germany, growth in these categories was led by early stage growth in colorectal surgery and benign hysterectomy. Year-over-year procedure growth in these non-neurology procedures was almost 3x higher than urology. While in the U.K., benign hysterectomy and colorectal resection experienced strong early-stage growth.\nIn Asia, we experienced strong growth in Japan, while in China, procedures remain below expectations as government restrictions continued due to COVID infections that persisted throughout most of the quarter. In Japan, growth in general surgery and gynecology continued to be strong with robust growth, specifically in benign hysterectomy, rectal resection and gastrectomy. In addition, prostatectomy continued with solid double-digit growth, reflecting a recovery when compared to the prior year, which was constrained by COVID. Further contributing to procedure strength was early growth in the adoption of newly reimbursed procedures namely colon resection and nephrectomy procedures.\nIn China, second quarter procedure growth continued to be negatively impacted by regional lockdowns due to ongoing COVID infections that affected many large cities throughout most of the quarter. Despite the restrictions, China experienced modest year-over-year growth and began to show signs of a return to normal run rates in June.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Earlier this year, Doctors Sarah Diaz and Robert Cleary from St. Joseph Mercy Hospital Ann Arbor, along with Doctors Yongjin Lee and Amir Bastawrous from the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, Washington and in collaboration with Intuitive, published a real-world body of evidence comparing health care utilization outcomes and payer/patient expenditures associated with open and minimally invasive colectomy for benign disease. Notably, this analysis also included a comparison of laparoscopic and da Vinci approaches.\nUtilizing the IBM MarketScan commercial claims and encounter database, this study included over 10,000 adult patients who between January 2013 and December 2018 underwent an elective inpatient colectomy for a benign condition with over 2,500 patients in the open group and over 6,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group and over 1,000 patients in the da Vinci Group. Through an inverse propensity treatment weighted analysis, the minimally invasive approach demonstrated a lower total health care expenditure across all time frames analyzed from the surgical procedure through 365 days post procedure, with lower average total expenditures ranging from $2,300 to $8,100.\nWith regards to resource utilization, the minimally invasive approach demonstrated an approximately 2-day lower length of stay with these patients less likely to be readmitted, visit the emergency department or visit the outpatient department within 365 days from the procedure. The reduction in health care use among minimally invasive patients translated to an additional savings over $5,700 and over 2 fewer days missed from work for health care visits.\nWithin the MIS category when comparing laparoscopic and da Vinci approaches, da Vinci had a 70% lower risk of conversion to open with over a half day shorter length of stay and patients were less likely to have an outpatient hospital visit within 1 year of the procedure. Of note, patients who had a conversion to open had a longer length of stay, higher hospital payments and were more likely to have a readmission for hospital visit within 1 year of the procedure. The reduction in conversion is translated to an additional savings of approximately $4,800 and 1.5 fewer days of missed work due to health care visits.\nThe authors concluded in part that minimally invasive colectomy is associated with lower mean health care expenditures and less mean health care resource utilization compared to the open approach for benign disease, with a shorter mean length of stay and conversion to open rate observed with the da Vinci approach.\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 14% to 16.5%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range assumes increasing COVID hospitalization and staffing pressure at hospitals for the remainder of the year. At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world continue to decline throughout the remainder of 2022, and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic.\nWhile procedure growth so far in the first half of 2022 has been healthy, the capital pipeline in the U.S. has been softer than in prior periods, mainly due to a lower number of Si Systems in the installed base available for trade-in and macro-related headwinds creating pressure on the hospital capital spending. Capital placements in more mature markets are a function of procedure demand that is moderated by system utilization growth and trade-in opportunities.\nWhile trade-in opportunities have declined, the core demand for procedures continues to be healthy and system utilization has been increasing. With a 3-year compound annual growth rate in procedures of 16% from Q2 of 2019 to Q2 of 2022 and installed base growth of 11% over the same period, utilization of installed systems has continued to increase through the pandemic and first half of 2022. This is increasing the value derived from the existing installed base for our customers and for us. As we look ahead, we expect these capital dynamics to continue for the foreseeable future.\nTurning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5%. We are now refining our estimate of pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70% of net revenue. Given the ongoing impact of higher input costs related to supply chain and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, we would expect to be towards the lower end of that range. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trading mix, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the impact of new product introductions.\nWith respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 27%. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 25%. We are refining our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between $520 million to $540 million in 2022. We are also refining our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $60 million and $70 million in 2022, an increase from our previous estimate of $50 million and $60 million. The increase primarily reflects the continued rise in interest rates.\nOn last quarter's call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $900 million. We are now refining estimated capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income.\nThat concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brian King, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian King;Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to Intuitive's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, CFO.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2022. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.\nToday's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today.\nIn the first quarter, procedure demand for our products was healthy, recovering where COVID receded. Drivers of procedure performance included general surgery in the U.S. and non-urology procedures outside of the U.S., which are our areas of focus. Regardless of the healthy procedure demand, we were challenged by environmental stresses, including regional waves of COVID, staffing pressure at hospitals, component and raw material availability and logistic delays. While it's difficult to forecast how long these headwinds will persist, our teams are working hard to meet the challenge.\nIn the quarter, da Vinci procedures grew 19% compared to the first quarter 2021. The use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States grew nicely, led by bariatric procedures, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and rectal surgery. Lobectomy growth was also healthy. Outside the United States, the U.K., China, Japan, Germany and Italy grew above our quarterly average growth rate, but I will note that some countries saw the beginnings of COVID slowdowns later in the quarter, in particular China and Korea.\nInternational use of da Vinci is diversifying beyond urology in several countries with growth in oncologic procedures in thoracic surgery, gynecology and general surgery. In Japan, MHLW increased reimbursement for robotically assisted gastrectomy and added another 8 procedures to reimbursement coverage in April, bringing the total number of covered da Vinci procedure types to over 25 in Japan. In our flexible robotics program, Ion procedures grew approximately 350% in Q1 compared with Q1 2021, reflecting continued strength in adoption and utilization of the platform.\nTurning to capital. Our team installed 311 da Vinci systems in the quarter compared with 298 systems in Q1 2021, bringing our total clinical installed base to 6,920 da Vinci systems. Placements varied by region with the U.K. standing out with a strong placement quarter. Capital placements have been historically lumpy and after several quarters of capital strength, we're seeing some near-term softening of our capital placement pipeline in the U.S. Contributing factors may include a pull-forward of Q1 2022 demand into Q4 2021 due to customer budget utilization at year-end, a reduction in the number of third-generation da Vinci systems available for trade-ins and an overall tightening of hospital finances.\nWith a 3-year CAGR in procedures of 15% from Q1 of '19 to Q1 of '22 and installed base growth of 11% over the same period, utilization of installed systems continue to climb through the pandemic and in the first quarter. This is increasing the value derived from the existing installed base for our customers and for us. Over the midterm, capital demand in mature robotic-assisted surgery segments is a function of procedure demand moderated by utilization growth. Jamie will give regional capital trends and Brian will give a more detailed procedure review later in the call.\nAs we exit the first quarter, we continue to invest in global expansion, innovation initiatives and our business infrastructure. Our spending in the quarter was roughly in line with our target. In instruments and accessories, we received Chinese NMPA clearance for our 45-millimeter and 60-millimeter SureForm staplers, our Vessel Sealer Extend and our Endoscope Plus. These products support the utility of our Xi systems for several procedures, particularly general and thoracic surgeries.\nTurning to Ion. We submitted our EU medical device regulation application for the platform to allow the entry of Ion into Europe. Our teams are also building production capacity and making improvements to customer workflow, planning software and reprocessing efficiency.\nIn digital products, the My Intuitive app community tripled year-over-year. It is now available in the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Ireland and Switzerland with launches set for Italy, Spain and India in Q2. Building on our Orpheus technology, our teams in Israel and the U.S. have created Intuitive Hub, a unified hardware and software solution for the operating room. Intuitive Hub enables OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and collaborate virtually using existing workflows and Intuitive systems.\nIn the quarter, we launched an upgraded interface to da Vinci systems that allows for automated video capture with integrated procedure annotation for key events, creating convenient video storage and review for da Vinci cases. Customer feedback for this integration has been encouraging. Across the installed base, the number of procedures in which Intuitive Hub was used grew approximately 60% year-over-year.\nTo our goal of adding Iris anatomical models, we're in conversations with FDA on how best to characterize some of its core AI technology, which will require a resubmission of our 510(k) for the next set of segmented organ models. Finally, the installed base of our virtual reality training simulator, SimNow, grew 33% in the quarter compared with a year ago.\nFor our single port program, da Vinci SP, we began the launch of our next-generation SP endoscope, which includes our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging technology and has 65% longer life. We also launched our next-generation core SP instruments that can apply higher forces during surgery and are more durable. Feedback on both has been encouraging.\nIn Japan, we submitted our da Vinci SP for clearance to PMDA seeking broad indications. We continue to pursue additional indications for SP in the U.S., which is important for broader adoption, with an ongoing IDE trial in colorectal surgery and an approved IDE for thoracic surgery. COVID and some site-specific delays have slowed our progress in our colorectal trial. We're working hard to expand the number of participating sites to accelerate its completion.\nStepping back, for 2022, our top priority is to support, supply and train our customers as they navigate a challenging environment. We are also focused on helping general surgeons in the United States adopt our technologies and diversifying our business outside the United States beyond urology and in executing on our new platforms and digital tools.\nI'll now turn the time over to Jamie Samath, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\nOverall, Q1 results reflected approximately 19% procedure growth as compared to the first quarter of 2021 and system placements of 311 systems, resulting in an expansion of the installed base of da Vinci systems of approximately 13%. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q1 revenue increased by 15% year-over-year.\nKey business metrics for the first quarter of 2022 were as follows. Within the 19% procedure growth, procedures in the U.S. increased 16% and OUS procedures grew by 25%. Procedures in the U.S. were impacted in January by the significant number of hospitalizations related to the Omicron variant. As rates of COVID-related hospitalizations declined in February and March, da Vinci procedures recovered quickly. On a 3-year compound annual growth rate basis, first quarter procedures grew approximately 15%.\nFirst quarter system placements of 311 increased 4% from the 298 systems placed last year. The number of systems placed in conjunction with a trade-in of an older generation system declined by 18% from the first quarter of 2021. That decline was entirely driven by the U.S. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 6% compared to last year. Using a 3-year CAGR, first quarter utilization grew 4%.\nDuring the quarter, the supply chain environment continued to be challenging and remains dynamic. In Q1, we continued to experience constraints in our ability to meet customer demand. And as a result, on-time delivery performance to our customers was lower than we have experienced so far during the pandemic.\nIn Europe, recently, we have experienced some geographically limited delays in fulfilling orders for some da Vinci instruments and accessories. These delays were due to a combination of the global supply chain and logistics issues, including our freight forwarder's unanticipated shutdown of its computer system. While these constraints did not have a material impact to our Q1 financial results, risks associated with potential disruption to our manufacturing operations and our ability to supply certain products to our customers remain significant. During the quarter, we also experienced higher logistics costs and manufacturing inefficiencies that impacted our gross margin.\nU.S. procedure growth of 16% over Q1 of 2021 reflected continued relative strength in bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., reflecting in part the significant adverse impact of COVID in Q1 of 2021. Procedure growth in the U.K. also reflected strong early-stage growth in hysterectomy, colorectal and thoracic procedures. Procedure growth in Germany and Italy was also strong, while procedure growth in France was adversely impacted by COVID-mitigation measures in the first part of the quarter.\nOverall procedure growth in Asia was solid with growth across a broad set of procedure categories. Q1 procedures in China and Korea were slightly lower than our expectations given the impact of the Omicron variant later in the quarter. Procedure growth in Japan was strong, reflecting some recovery in urologic procedures and strong growth in rectal, hysterectomy and thoracic, key procedures that were granted da Vinci reimbursement in April of 2020.\nThe impact of the Delta variant in Q3 of last year and the impact of the Omicron variant in this past quarter highlight the continued risk of future COVID waves and the associated significant risks to the number of da Vinci procedures that may be performed. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call.\nAs Gary indicated, during the quarter, we experienced a softening in our U.S. capital pipeline, which we expect to impact system placements in the near term. In the U.S., we placed 186 systems in the first quarter, lower than 190 in Q1 of 2021, reflecting a decline of 28 systems associated with trade-in transactions, partially offset by increased placements to greenfield customers. The remaining installed base of Si systems in the U.S. is approximately 268 systems.\nOutside the U.S., we placed 125 systems in the first quarter compared with 108 in the first quarter of 2021. Current quota system placements included 78 into Europe, 19 into Japan and 9 into China compared with 59 into Europe, 8 into Japan and 23 into China in the first quarter of 2021. We placed 30 systems in the U.K. in Q1 driven in part by the timing of government budget cycles. We do not expect to place similar levels of systems in the remainder of 2022 in the U.K.\nCapital performance in Japan was driven primarily by greenfield accounts and some existing customers adding capacity in anticipation of the 8 additional procedure reimbursements taking effect on April 1. System placements in China were moderately impacted by longer logistic cycle times as a result of lockdowns in response to increased COVID cases. As of the end of Q1 2022, there were 55 systems remaining under the current quota in China, which may also be available to competitors that have received local regulatory clearance.\nGlobally, trade-in transactions represented 35% of placements in the quarter compared to 38% for the full year of 2021 and 48% for the full year 2020. Given the lower number of older-generation systems in the field, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021.\nHospitals continue to experience financial and operational pressures as a result of staffing shortages, the supply chain environment and resulting inflation. Since the start of the pandemic in 2020, the impact of COVID has placed a significant burden on hospitals. The financial pressures our customers have faced have been partially mitigated by government funding, such as the approximately $178 billion of CARES Act and other relief made available to hospitals in the U.S.\nThe rising interest rate environment increases debt servicing costs and may make access to new debt more challenging. To the extent that hospitals continue to face financial pressures, reductions in government funding and higher interest rates, hospital capital spending may be adversely impacted. In addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure.\nAdditional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total first quarter revenue was $1.49 billion, an increase of 15% from last year. Leasing represented 35% of Q1 placements compared with 37% last year, last quarter rather. The slightly lower first quarter lease mix primarily reflected the mix of customers who prefer to purchase systems. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time.\nFirst quarter system average selling prices were $1.54 million, higher than the $1.45 million last quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by a lower mix of bulk buy transactions with large customers and a favorable product mix, in particular a higher proportion of Xi dual system placements in the quarter.\nWe recognized $16 million of lease buyout revenue in Q1 compared with $26 million last quarter and $19 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so.\nInstrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,870 per procedure compared with $1,940 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2021 and down 4% from the $1,950 realized in the first quarter of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q1 of 2021 associated with the launch of our extended use instruments program in the U.S. and Europe and an unfavorable FX impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential decline primarily reflects lower stocking orders associated with lower system placements, hospital ordering patterns and a small unfavorable impact from FX.\nWe placed 34 Ion systems in the quarter as compared to 14 Ion placements in the first quarter of last year. The installed base of Ion systems is now 163 systems, of which 70 are under operating lease arrangements. First quarter Ion procedures of just over 3,900 are up over 4x compared to the first quarter of 2021. Seven of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, including 3 systems placed at customers in Korea. Our installed base of SP systems is now 106.\nFirst quarter SP procedures grew approximately 36% year-over-year with approximately 50% growth in transoral procedures, a small but high-value segment. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea.\nMoving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 was 69.8% compared with 71.8% for the first quarter 2021 and 70.1% last quarter. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last quarter, primarily as a result of higher logistics costs and increased fixed costs relative to revenue as we invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to serve our long-term needs. While net inventory grew approximately $66 million quarter-over-quarter, there are still a number of components and products that are below our targeted levels.\nPro forma operating expenses increased 26% compared with the first quarter of 2021. The increase in first quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an increase in headcount, increased variable compensation and higher customer-facing costs, customer training, travel costs and marketing programs. As of the end of Q1, we had just over 10,500 employees, an increase of 26% from the first quarter of 2021 or an increase of 20% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Of the approximately 2,100 employees we have added over the last year, approximately 900 are manufacturing employees.\nCapital expenditures in Q1 were $95 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint, increase manufacturing capacity and automation of certain production lines.\nOur pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.3%, slightly above our expectations primarily due to certain discrete tax items. Our pro forma tax rate was above the 22.2% for 2021, primarily due to a previous change in U.S. tax law that became effective on January 1, 2022. Our first quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $413 million or $1.13 per share compared with $427 million or $1.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $366 million or $1 per share for the first quarter of 2022 compared with GAAP net income of $426 million or $1.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.4 billion compared with $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. The sequential reduction in cash and investments in the first quarter primarily reflected share repurchases, capital expenditures and unrealized losses on interest-bearing investments classified as available for sale, partially offset by cash from operating activities and proceeds from employee stock plans. During the quarter, we repurchased 398,000 shares at an average price of $268 per share for a total expenditure of $107 million.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2022.\n\nBrian King;Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jamie.\nOur overall first quarter 2022 procedure growth was 19% compared to 16% for the first quarter of 2021. The 3-year compound annual growth rate was 15% between the first quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2022 procedure growth benefited by 140 basis points from 1 additional workday in the quarter.\nIn the U.S., first quarter 2022 procedure growth was 16% year-over-year compared to 14% for the first quarter of 2021 and 16% last quarter. On a 3-year compound annual growth basis, U.S. procedure growth was 13%. In the U.S., first quarter growth was again driven by growth in procedures within general surgery. Bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair were the largest contributors to procedure growth, while growth in foregut and rectal resection were also strong contributors.\nOutside of the U.S., first quarter procedure volume grew approximately 25% compared with 23% for the first quarter of 2021 and 28% last quarter. On a 3-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 20%. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., Italy and Germany, partially reflecting the disruption caused by COVID in the first quarter of 2021. In the U.K., procedure growth was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories, supported by early-stage growth in hysterectomy, colorectal and thoracic procedures. Procedure growth in Germany and Italy was also driven by procedures outside of urology with growth driven by colorectal, hysterectomy and thoracic procedures.\nCapital placements were also strong in the U.K. with the placement of 30 systems, the highest number of systems placed in the U.K. in a single quarter, driven in part by government funding and the trade-ins of older-generation systems. In Japan, growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic continued to be strong with robust growth specifically in benign hysterectomy, gastrectomy and lobectomy. In addition, urologic procedures, specifically prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy, both experienced solid double-digit growth, reflecting a recovery when compared to the prior year, which was constrained by COVID.\nIn China and Korea, first quarter procedure growth was solid but slightly below expectations as we saw a resurgence in March of COVID infections, regional lockdowns and hospitalizations, which negatively impacted procedure volumes. In China, growth in urology was solid, in particular with growth in prostatectomy, nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy. We continue to see broad-based growth in general surgery, thoracic and gynecology as well. As we enter the second quarter this year, we are seeing the negative impact on procedure volume as a result of continued regional lockdowns.\nNow turning to Ion, our robotic-assisted endoluminal platform focused today on minimally invasive lung biopsy procedures. First quarter 2022 Ion procedures totaled just over 3,900 in Q1 2022, an approximately 350% increase over the prior year and 34% over the prior quarter. Ion system placements were also strong, ending Q1 '22 with 163 installed systems, growing approximately 225% over the prior year.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.\nDuring the quarter, Dr. Paresh Shah, along with colleagues from the Robert I. Grossman School of Medicine at New York University and in collaboration with Intuitive, published a real-world body of evidence assessing open conversion rates during minimally invasive surgery using laparoscopic/thoracoscopic or da Vinci robotic surgery across 10 common procedures for benign or malignant conditions. Utilizing the Premier Healthcare Database, this study included over 275,000 adult patients who, between January 2013 and September 2015, underwent a minimally invasive procedure, including hysterectomy, sigmoidectomy, right colectomy, ventral or inguinal hernia repair, partial nephrectomy, lobectomy or low anterior resection.\nOverall, a 5% conversion to open rate for the MIS approach was observed across all procedures with a range of 1% to 24%. Converted to open patients were associated with a 1.8-day longer length of stay, 1.7x greater risk of readmission within 30 days of the procedure and a significantly higher in-hospital or perioperative 30-day total cost, adding approximately $2,900 to the in-hospital cost and $3,400 to the total 30-day cost. The researchers also compared differences in conversions between the laparoscopic/thoracoscopic and da Vinci cohorts. After performing propensity score matching, conversion rates for da Vinci procedures were significantly lower than LAP or VATS across all procedures. The volume-weighted conversion rate for da Vinci was approximately 2.8%, corresponding to a total relative conversion reduction for all study procedures of 58.5% compared to the laparoscopic or the thoracoscopic procedures.\nThe researchers concluded in part, \"From the standpoint of population health or a hospital system, these high-level data indicated that a cumulative effect of conversions can be a significant burden. And that reduction of conversion has major benefits and leads to increased value for the patient, the hospital and society at large. The use of robotic-assisted surgery is associated with a significant decrease in the conversion rate for all 10 operations studied, and a multidisciplinary robotic program encompassing several specialties could result in significantly decreased conversion rates with an improved ability to deliver successful minimally invasive surgery to its patients.\"\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecast full year 2022 procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2022 procedure growth of 12% to 16%. This range continues to reflect the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of the range assumes ongoing COVID and staffing pressure at hospitals and assume some continued choppiness with COVID throughout the year. At the high end of the range, we assume COVID-19-related hospitalizations around the world decline throughout the remainder of 2022, and there are no additional significant impacts from further resurgences. As noted last quarter, the range does not reflect significant supply chain disruptions.\nThe steep increase in infections and subsequent recovery in the quarter from the Omicron variant in the U.S. and the trend in procedure volumes we have seen exiting the quarter in China highlight the risk to the number of procedures that may be performed. In the second quarter of 2022, our year-over-year procedure growth rate will likely be lower than recent quarters as Q2 2021 results reflected a strong recovery in procedures as COVID began to subside.\nTurning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2022 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69.5% and 70.5%. We are now slightly expanding the range of our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 69% and 70.5% of net revenue. The lower end of the range was updated to reflect the impact on input costs related to supply chain, inflation and some impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.\nWith respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 27%. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 23% and 27%. We continue to expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $510 million and $550 million in 2022. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $50 million and $60 million in 2022.\nOn last quarter's call, we forecast 2022 capital expenditures within a range of $700 million to $1 billion. We are now refining estimated capital expenditures for 2022 to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million based primarily on the current timing of planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income.\nThat concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brian King, Head of Investor Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you. So good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Jamie Samath, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 10, 2021, and Form 10-Q filed on October 20, 2021.\nOur SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page. Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.\nToday's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our fourth quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights; Jamie will provide a review of our financial results; and I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our financial outlook for 2022. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today. 2021 required agility as we drove through significant headwinds to support customers and manage our supply chain. Our teams performed well, helping customers return to surgery when COVID allowed them and maintaining the integrity of our supply chain and workforce.\nGiven our recent press release updating procedures, capital placements and revenues, I'll be brief in describing our full year 2021 results and spend a little more time outlining our plans for 2022 and beyond. Putting 2021 in context, demand for our robotically-assisted interventions has been resilient during COVID. While these interventions get delayed during COVID peaks, the return is COVID wanes, and that is encouraging. Pandemic stresses on health care systems emphasize the need for the kind of high-quality, minimally invasive interventions or products enable.\nMIS procedures allow greater use of ambulatory surgery, free up resources and ORs relative to other approaches and often enable faster patient return to home and overall recovery.\nIn 2021, da Vinci procedures grew 28% compared to full year 2020, reflecting a partial recovery in surgery after the first wave of the pandemic. Over the 2-year period, 2020 and 2021, the compound annual growth rate in procedures was 14%. Capital installs were healthy in 2021, with our team placing 1,347 da Vinci and 93 Ion systems in the year, driving da Vinci placement growth of 44% over 2020 and at a CAGR of 10% over the past 2 years. With a 2-year CAGR in procedures of 14% and installed base growth of 10% over the same period, utilization of installed systems continue to climb through the pandemic. We think this is good for our customers and good for us. Jamie will give regional capital trends and Brian will give detailed procedure dynamics later in the call.\nThe past 2 years have stressed more than health systems. Our ability to attract, develop and retain outstanding staff remains a key focus for us. Our team has performed well, supporting our customers and each other. In the year, we added approximately 1,700 employees to our team with net headcount growth of approximately 180 in R&D, 920 in operations and 340 in our commercial force. Of the 1,700 net additions, 700 were outside of the United States.\nLooking out over the next decade, we believe that the method we have developed to identify clinical need, then design a technology-enabled ecosystem for improving the quadruple aim, then deliver and train customers on this ecosystem, can positively impact a broad set of minimally invasive interventions. The opportunity and challenge for Intuitive is to evolve our ecosystem to support our customers and ourselves at scale and to choose procedural opportunities and platform architectures that made sense.\nTurning to investments in the midterm. Our priority for use of our capital is to reinvest in the business, to develop new opportunities that improve the quadruple aim and to strengthen our operating capabilities at global scale. We are focused on driving a vital set of initiatives, and I'd like to describe the dynamics for you in a little more detail.\nIn multiport, we believe our Gen 4 architecture is outstanding and we've been adding capability to this product line since launch, including significant expansion and upgrades to energy and stapling product lines, improved endoscopic imaging, the introduction of da Vinci X, the introduction of Extended Use Instruments, training technologies and finally, the introduction of new and upgraded connectivity and data management tools. Given the precision, robustness and overall performance of our Generation 4 robotics architecture, we will continue to innovate on this platform, bringing additional value to those customers who have standardized on Generation 4 fleets.\nWe are also investing in new core capabilities for our multiport systems, both Generation 4 and beyond that we'll describe as they get closer to market. You should expect continued innovation from us here.\nTurning to Ion. Our first indication addresses a large unmet need in lung cancer biopsy and our focus is fully enabling our production capability and customer ecosystem for this indication. There is strong demand for lung biopsy, and we are working to expand manufacturing capacity of all processes for greater quality and lower costs at scale and run trials and address regulatory requirements that enable global expansion. Over time, we plan for total Ion program profitability to approach that of our corporate average as we execute against our volume, design and process improvement goals. We are pursuing additional applications for Ion, and we'll describe them as we get closer to market.\nFor our single-port system, da Vinci SP has the opportunity to change the standard of care in 2 different types of soft tissue surgery: those that require the extraction of tissue that can be done through a small single port and those procedures that benefit from narrow entry into the body as a whole. Where Ion, at its current stage of launch, has a single indication that represents a large patient population, SP's opportunity is the aggregation of several midsized indications.\nFor example, SPUs and transoral robotic surgery is growing steadily in the U.S. To broaden SP's applicability in the U.S. and other markets, we are undertaking clinical trials to support regulatory review. We believe that SP will serve several additional surgical specialties, which will allow our customers and us to leverage capital investments in the program. Like Ion, we plan for SP platform profitability to approach that of historical platforms over time, and we're encouraged by recent progress.\nOur customer digital efforts now represent roughly 5% of our total operating expenses and drive the business in 4 ways. First, the use of data and digital tools by customers to analyze their operations helps improve outcomes, reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction and retention. Second, digital and internal investments can decrease our cost to serving our customer. Third, some of our digital tools generate revenue themselves and finally, use of data and analytics internally can help our teams make better decisions. Because digital and data tools span our platforms and are used externally and internally, we do not account for them using the same financial models as our platforms, nor do we break them out as stand-alone financial engines. That said, we do evaluate digital and data projects against internal strategic and return analysis.\nOver the past 5 years, the annual number of instruments we produce has grown roughly 200% and the annual number of systems we produce has more than doubled. The number of customer professionals trained annually has nearly doubled, and our engineering staff has nearly tripled. Our product volume growth has also allowed us to in-source some of our high-volume accessories while investing in automation. This has a threefold benefit: improving supply chain robustness, improving manufacturing quality and lowering unit costs.\nAs our training, R&D and manufacturing efforts move to scale, we're investing in infrastructure, factory builds, training center expansion and automation. These infrastructure investments are lumpy, and our current growth cycle requires building capacity. These projects have been planned over the past couple of years and will start amortizing first moderately in 2022 and more substantially in 2023 and '24, then normalizing over the next few years.\nFor example, over the next 4 years, we'll be growing and consolidating facilities for operations, R&D and customer training space in Atlanta; doubling our Mexicali manufacturing footprint; doubling our R&D design space and operations space as our California headquarters; and finally, consolidating and growing our commercial training operations and R&D space in Germany.\nIn summary, we'll build on our Generation 4 capabilities in multiport while innovating in clinical utility for multiport surgery broadly. We'll continue to bring our flexible endoscopy platform Ion to scale and drive capacity, quality and cost improvements while seeking to broaden access to new markets. In SP, we expect to expand indications in regional markets while driving manufacturing quality and scale. We will invest in regional training, R&D and manufacturing centers globally to support the growth of the business and pursue opportunities for operating leverage given volume, some of which we'll share with customers to catalyze elastic markets. Finally, we will continue to advance our digital efforts to enable fast, accurate and actionable decisions with our customers and for our company.\nLastly, for 2022, particularly, we're focused on the following: first, outstanding customer support in the face of continued pandemic disruption; second, execution of our robotic and digital platform expansion in pursuit of new indications and new markets; third, general surgery growth in the United States; and finally, diversified growth outside the U.S. beyond urology.\nAs we turn to our financial report, I'd like to formally thank Marshall Mohr, our outgoing CFO and new Head of Global Business Services, for his outstanding stewardship over the past 15 years, and turn the time over to our incoming CFO, Jamie Samath, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.\n\nJamie E. Samath\n\nCFO, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. Reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\nQ4 and 2021 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 12. Before I dive into our Q4 results, let me start with a summary of our full year 2021 performance. Given the significant impact of COVID, we believe it's appropriate to review our 2021 results on both a year-over-year and a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis.\nProcedures increased by 28% as compared to 2020 and increased by approximately 14% using a 2-year CAGR. We placed 1,347 systems of customers during the year, an increase of 44% as compared to 2020 and up 10% using a 2-year CAGR. As a result of this procedure and system placement performance, 2021 revenue increased by 31% year-over-year and increased by 13% using a 2-year CAGR.\nKey business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows: fourth quarter procedures increased approximately 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased approximately 13% using a 2-year CAGR. During the quarter, procedures continued to recover in October and November from the impact of the Delta variant in Q3. However, in December, procedures were adversely impacted by the increase in hospitalizations in the U.S. and parts of Europe as the Omicron variant spread rapidly. This trend has worsened so far into January.\nFourth quarter system placements of 385 increased 18% from the 326 systems placed last year. As a result, net of trade-ins and retirements, we expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 12%. On a 2-year CAGR, our installed base is up 10%. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system increased approximately 7% compared to last year, and increased approximately 3% using a 2-year CAGR.\nDuring the quarter, the supply chain environment became more challenging and remains highly dynamic. Our supply chain teams continue to work tirelessly with our supply chain partners to fulfill customer demand. In Q4, we experienced minor constraints in our ability to meet customer demand. For example, we had some limitations on supply of skill simulators. While these constraints were relatively minor and were immaterial to our overall Q4 financial results, they highlight the risk of potential significant disruption to our manufacturing operations due to the current supply chain challenges.\nU.S. procedures grew approximately 16% over Q4 2020 with relative strength in bariatrics, cholecysectomy and hernia repair. The December impact of the current wave of COVID on U.S. procedures varied by region, with a greater impact in the Northeast and Midwest. Benign procedures such as benign hysterectomy experienced a more significant impact in December, reflecting the deferrability of certain elective surgeries. In Europe, the impact on COVID on procedures in December was most notable in France and Italy.\nDespite the fact that hospitals are generally better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in the U.S. and parts of Europe have challenged hospital resources and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures.\nIn the U.S., high COVID-related hospitalization rates have been exacerbated by staffing shortages. According to data reported by the Department of Health and Human Services, the proportion of hospitals reporting a critical staffing shortage doubled between July and December. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have and will also negatively impact da Vinci procedures.\nQ4 procedures in Asia were not significantly impacted by a resurgence in COVID, and we saw strong procedure growth across multiple specialties in China, Korea and Japan. While it is difficult to predict how long the current wave of COVID will last or the extent to which it will impact additional geographies, we expect that da Vinci procedures will be significantly adversely impacted in Q1. Brian will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call.\nOverall system placement results in Q4 were solid with U.S. placements of 235, up 20% from 196 in Q4 of 2020. System placements at greenfield customers were strong, up approximately 45% as compared to Q4 of 2020, driven by U.S. IDNs and new customers in OUS markets. Outside the U.S., we placed 150 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 130 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Current quarter system placements included 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan and 14 into China, compared with 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China in the fourth quarter of 2020. Capital strength in Japan was driven primarily by new customers in the private sector.\nAs of the end of 2021, there were 63 systems remaining under the current quarter in China, which may be accessible to competitors should they receive local regulatory clearance. Globally, trade and transactions represented 30% of placements in the quarter, down from 40% last quarter and 49% for 2020. The remaining installed base of SI systems in the U.S. is approximately 343 systems.\nWe expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID, including supply chain constraints and staffing shortages, are challenging and could impact hospital capital spending. In addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressure.\nAdditional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total fourth quarter revenue was $1.55 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. Leasing represented 37% of Q4 placements compared with 41% last quarter and flat to Q4 of 2020. The lower leasing mix in Q4 relative to last quarter reflected higher multisystem placements with a couple of IDNs who prefer to purchase systems. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will continue to increase over time.\nFourth quarter system average selling prices were $1.45 million, similar to $1.43 million last year and lower than $1.57 million last quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of bulk by transactions with large customers. We recognized $26 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $25 million last quarter and $14 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so.\nInstrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,940 per procedure compared with $1,900 per procedure in the third quarter of 2021 and down 6% from $2,060 realized in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the benefit of stocking orders in Q4 of 2020 and associated with the launch of our Extended Use Instruments program in the U.S. and Europe. The sequential increase primarily reflects continued growth of our advanced instrument portfolio.\nAs we highlighted recently, revenue for our advanced instrument portfolio has grown over a 5-year period at a compound annual growth rate of 35%, and we are starting to see early and accelerating adoption in OUS markets. Ten of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, including 3 systems placed at customers in Korea. Our installed base of SP systems is now 99.\nDuring the quarter, we further developed our SP ecosystem, receiving 510(k) clearance for our Firefly Imaging Technology. We also received 510(k) clearance for enhancements to our SP instruments, including an extension of lives to 6 of our 8 instruments. Growth of the SP platform will continue to be gated by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the U.S. and Korea.\nWe placed 31 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 129 systems. Looking at the 93 Ion systems placed in 2021, 54% of those systems were placed under operating lease arrangements. For reference, the list price of our Ion system is $600,000 with ASPs generally a little below that level. As a reminder, Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts.\nThe entirety of our Ion installed base is with an existing da Vinci customers, the majority of which have large pulmonary and thoracic departments. Our Ion platform is also installed the majority of accounts that have an IP fellowship program. We continue to be encouraged by customer feedback and look forward to the completion of our next major milestone, the full results from the PRECIsE study, which is expected in the second half of 2022.\nMoving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 70.1% compared with 69.7% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 71.3% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last quarter primarily as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics costs associated with the supply chain environment, lower system ASPs and a higher mix of systems revenue.\nPro forma operating expenses increased 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2021 included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $25 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in fourth quarter operating expenses from a year ago reflected an increase in headcount, increased variable compensation and higher travel costs.\nWe finished 2021 with almost 9,800 employees, an increase of 21% from the end of 2020. We believe the opportunity in robotic-assisted interventions to be significant and are planning to increase our investments significantly in 2022. We are at the early stages of our newer platforms, SP and Ion, and we will continue to invest in our digital and data capabilities. Brian will provide operating expense guidance later in this call.\nAs Gary described, we are also investing in our infrastructure to support our growth objectives and facilitate our ability to scale. In 2022, we expect a significant increase in capital expenditures in the range of $700 million to $1 billion of capital investment for the year. A significant portion of this investment involves construction of facilities to provide incremental space for growth, to consolidate operations to enhance efficiency and to replace lease spaces with own spaces. These capital investments also expand our OUS footprint in support of opportunities for growth in key international markets, where da Vinci procedures are in earlier stages of adoption. These are multiyear investments.\nOur pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.5% lower than our expectation, primarily due to a favorable U.S./OUS income mix. We expect that our pro forma tax rate will increase in 2022 and due to a previous change in U.S. tax law that became effective on January 1, 2022. Brian will provide details later in this call.\nOur fourth quarter 2021 pro forma net income was $477 million or $1.30 per share compared with $434 million or $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020.\nI will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $365 million or $1.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and IP charges, acquisition-related items and legal settlements.\nWe ended the year with cash and investments of $8.6 billion compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter primarily reflected cash generated from operations. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2022.\n\nBrian King\n\nThank you, Jamie.\nOverall procedure growth for the full year 2021 was approximately 28% as compared to 1% in 2020 and increased 14% using a 2-year compound annual growth rate. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 27% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth in OUS markets.\nIn the U.S., fourth quarter growth was driven by growth in procedures within general surgery. Bariatrics, cholecystectomy and hernia repair were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Fourth quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 28% compared with 11% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 30% last quarter. In 2021, we non-urology specialties approached half of all OUS procedures and grew faster than urologic procedures. More specifically, at a region and country level, in China, Q4 procedures also had broad-based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. General surgery, thoracic and gynecology procedures grew faster than urology and combined, made up more than total urology procedures in the fourth quarter.\nIn Japan, the Vinci prostatectomy has emerged as standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer. We've also gained significant market share in other urologic procedures, including partial nephrectomy and cystectomy. The robust growth that we continue to see in Japan is now attributable to growth in general surgery, thoracic and gynecology procedures that were granted reimbursement status subsequent to urologic procedures. In Europe, procedure performance varied by country, but in procedures outside of urology, growth was driven by colorectal, hysterectomy for cancer and thoracic procedures.\nNow turning to the clinical side of our business. I'll highlight 2 recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.\nDuring the quarter, researchers from the University Hospital of Southern Jutland and the University of Southern Denmark published results from a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted and laparoscopic colon surgery for patients with cancer. This analysis included 20 studies from 2005 to 2020, describing comparing outcomes from over 13,000 subjects with over 1,500 robotic-assisted procedures and over 12,000 laparoscopic procedures.\nBetween the 2 groups, a significant difference favoring the robotic-assisted approach demonstrated a 46% lower risk of anastomotic leakage -- sorry, in addition, robotic-assisted colon surgery showed a 69% lower risk of conversion to open when compared to the laparoscopic approach, while also demonstrating a 15% reduction in the overall complication rate favoring the robotic-assisted approach and a 7-hour reduction in time to regular diet.\nInterestingly, a subgroup analysis was performed analyzing right-sided hemicolectomies, noting the prevalence of this procedure in the study is analyzed. And with over 850 subjects in the robotic-assisted group and over 3,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group, the robotic-assisted approach was similarly favored with regards to anastomotic leakage, rate of conversion to open and length of stay.\nThe authors concluded in part, \"robotic-assisted colon surgery showed advantages in colon cancer surgery regarding surgical efficacy and morbidity compared to laparoscopic colon surgery.\" In November of last year, Christopher Cedar from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, published propensity adjusted analysis comparing robotic-assisted and thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection in obese patients. Leveraging data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons general thoracic database, Epithora-French National Database and McMaster University thoracic surgical database, over 8,000 subjects were identified for analysis with over 2,100 robotic-assisted subjects and over 5,900 VATS subjects included.\nAfter propensity score adjustments of the populations, the VATS patient showed a 15% rate of conversion to open compared to only 3% in the robotic cohort, which corresponded to risk of conversion 5x higher for the VATS approach. In addition, the robotic-assisted group demonstrated a shorter mean length of stay of approximately 0.7 days, 1% lower risk of respiratory failure and were more likely to be to start home after the procedure.\nOf note, this analysis is the first propensity-adjusted analysis comparing VATS and robotic-assisted anatomic lung resection in obese patients as well as the first to pull contemporary international patient level data. The authors concluded in part, \"Overall, these data suggest that obese patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer undergoing minimally invasive anatomic lung resection with VATS, have a higher rate of conversion to thoracotomy when compared to patients undergoing anatomic loan resection with robotic-assisted surgery.\"\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for 2022. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2021 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 28% year-over-year and 14% at a 2-year compound annual growth rate to roughly 1,594,000 procedures performed worldwide.\nDuring 2022, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. This range reflects the uncertainty associated with the course of the pandemic. The low end of this range assumes ongoing COVID pressure and hospital staffing shortages, while the high end assumes no significant new surges after the current wave. In addition, this range does not contemplate any material supply chain disruptions throughout the year.\nWe expect 2022 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedure growth in OUS markets where we are at earlier stages of adoption. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2022 as we have experienced in previous years prior to COVID, with Q1 being seasonally -- the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. We expect Omicron to have a significant adverse impact on procedures in the first quarter.\nWith respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including U.S. health care policy, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors.\nWithin this framework, we'd expect 2022 capital placement seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter, but could also be impacted by hospital staff shortages and the allocation of resources to managing current care.\nDuring Q3 and Q4, 40% and 30%, respectively, of systems placements involve trade-ins of older systems to our da Vinci Xi. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the volume of trade-ins to be significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021.\nTurning to gross profit. Our full year 2021 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.2%. In 2022, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69.5% and 70.5% of net revenue. The slightly lower gross profit margin anticipated in 2022 reflects higher fixed costs from investments to drive growth of the business, strengthen our operating capabilities and also reflects the impact of higher supply chain costs. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions.\nTurning to operating expenses. In 2021, our pro forma operating expenses grew 19%. In 2022, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 21% and 27%. The operating expense growth reflects increased investment in R&D for our new product platforms, expanding OUS capabilities and the return of other spending that was previously restricted by COVID.\nWe expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $510 million to $550 million in 2022 compared to $452 million in 2021. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $45 million and $55 million in 2022.\nWith regard to income tax, in 2021, our pro forma income tax rate was 22.2%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2022 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income, with the increase primarily due to a change in U.S. tax treatment of certain expenditures that was enacted in 2017, but became effective on January 1, 2022.\nLastly, we'd like to highlight that our Annual Sustainability Report will be available after this call on our Investor Relations website. In the latest report, we provide an overview of the current state of our sustainability strategy, areas of focus, key actions taken over the past year to develop sustainable solutions that meet our customer needs in new ways and our results achieved to date.\nThat concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

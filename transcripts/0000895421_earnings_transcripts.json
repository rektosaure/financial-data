Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call.\nOn behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.\nToday's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick.\n\nEdward N. Pick\n\nCo-President, Head of Institutional Securities Group & Co-Head of Corporate Strategy, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, Morgan Stanley generated record top and bottom line performance with revenues of $18.2 billion and EPS of $2.80. Robust returns on tangible of 23.5% reflect the operating leverage of the integrated firm. The capital markets flywheel is taking hold as the administration seeks to execute on its 3-pronged strategy to reshape the economy, with Fed rate cuts likely to continue into next year. Across public and private markets, institutional and retail clients are engaged, seeking trusted advice and global access from investment bankers, financial advisers and market specialists.\nFrom the first quarter of 2024, a top priority for the team has continued to be the reaffirmation of Morgan Stanley's strategy to raise, manage and allocate capital. And over time, to execute on a higher plane when favorable capital markets environments permit. Our business model is activity based. And while we cannot control the broader economic and market backdrop, the heart of the Morgan Stanley investment thesis remains our delivering earnings and returns durability, alongside continued dividend growth through periods of uncertainty.\nThis focus on maintaining earnings durability and driving earnings growth is governed by execution rigor inside the lanes of the priorities outlined in our annual strategy deck. The readout of sequential EPS results during this period underscores ownership of earnings growth and durability against different economic backdrops, $2.02, $1.82, $1.88, $2.22, $2.60, $2.13, and now $2.80.\nMorgan Stanley is well positioned in each of our businesses, and is demonstrating consistent execution. Total client assets across Wealth and Investment Management are up $1.3 trillion over the last year, and have reached $8.9 trillion. In Wealth, our scale and client reach continue to drive performance. Reported margins were a full 30%. We added $81 billion of net new assets and $42 billion in fee-based flows in the quarter.\nInvestment Management continues to scale capabilities with sustained leadership from Parametric. Across all 3 regions, our Institutional Securities business delivered outstanding results. Our equities business affirmed its #1 position with a standout quarter. A rebound in the investment banking environment reopened the door to strategic M&A and renewed financing activity. The equity underwriting result was also industry-leading this quarter, which speaks to the power of our integrated investment bank.\nWith respect to the bank regulatory capital framework, regulators are moving toward a more balanced approach, executing on their prudential oversight responsibilities and more leveling the competitive playing field, where the largest, best-capitalized financial institutions can once again act as a primary engine to drive sustainable economic growth. Morgan Stanley specifically appreciates the Fed's recent reconsideration of our CCAR results, and we look forward to ongoing dialogue and transparency. Our excess CET1 capital stands at over 300 basis points.\nPeriods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty were to be expected. As we transition from the post-pandemic period, we called the end of the end of history to a period we now could call the continuation of history, a period in which the push and pull of industrial policy, national identity and technological innovation will continue to be front of mind for our clients and stakeholders.\nMorgan Stanley will continue to capture opportunities around the world through cycles, staying close to our clients as they raise, manage and allocate capital. We are actively investing in the Integrated Firm across Wealth and Investment Management, Institutional Securities and across our bank and infrastructure units. We are deploying capital and expanding capabilities through the wealth funnel and enhancing the global distribution of our asset management offerings.\nAs macro uncertainty and enormous opportunity uncomfortably coexist, our 2025 year-to-date results demonstrate both the capability and the capacity to deliver earnings durability and generate operating leverage against shifting economic and geopolitical backdrops.\nMorgan Stanley's strategy remains consistent. Our durable earnings and capital strength are clear. The quarter's performance across Wealth and Investment Management, alongside the strength across Institutional Securities in all 3 regions underscores the proposition of the Integrated Firm. We are focused on generating strong returns for our shareholders and have real degrees of flexibility to pursue growth opportunities across our core businesses. We are committed to advancing through $10 trillion in total client assets and on to the next phase of Morgan Stanley's growth trajectory.\nAs the firm celebrates its 90th anniversary, we're as ever focused on executing first-class business in a first-class way across the integrated firm for our clients, our shareholders and our colleagues.\nSharon will now take us through the quarter in greater detail.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, and good morning. The Firm delivered exceptional results in the third quarter, underscoring the power of our global Integrated Firm and the scale of $8.9 trillion in total client assets. Performance was very strong across the businesses and regions, driving record revenues. [ CVA ] of $2.80 and an ROTCE of 23.5%. The year-to-date efficiency ratio, 69%.\nThe Firm continues to demonstrate operating leverage while maintaining focus on longer-term investments. Our investment in Workplace, E*TRADE and our Investment Banking franchise are yielding results. Our early AI use cases, some live and some in pilot, are showing progress. These include the DevGen.AI tool, which enhances developer efficiency by modernizing code. [ Parable ], an interactive tool that quickly analyzes and summarizes data, and LeadIQ, our AI-powered lead distribution platform, focusing on matching workplace and self-directed relationships and facilitating engagement with our financial advisers. Together, these use cases are laying the foundation to drive productivity across the firm.\nNow to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were standout at $8.5 billion, driving powerful operating leverage. While the Americas led to year-over-year growth, clients were active around the world. We are continuing to see attractive returns from steadily investing across the integrated investment bank. Themes around emerging technologies and renewed investor appetite in Asia contributed to the results.\nInvestment banking activity has meaningfully improved after several years of muted volumes. Capital markets reopened and supported underwriting issuance across both debt and equity products. Specifically, market receptivity for IPOs encouraged both sponsor and founder-led companies to come to market. This, combined with strong credit metrics, set the stage for renewed strategic activity. Investment banking revenues increased to $2.1 billion, marking one of the strongest quarters in recent years. The year-over-year improvement was driven by broad-based strength, with underwriting results up over 50%.\nAdvisory revenues increased year-over-year to $684 million, driven by higher completed activity. Equity underwriting revenues increased 80% year-over-year to $652 million, driven by IPO activity and further supported by strength across equity products and sectors. Activity picked up materially in September on the back of record-breaking post-Labor Day issuance in the Americas.\nFixed income underwriting revenues were $772 million, driven by higher non-investment grade and investment-grade loan issuance. As the M&A market shows signs of recovery, event lending commitments -- event-related lending commitments met receptive markets. Results were supported by higher flow activity as clients took advantage of refinancing opportunities.\nSecular themes and pent-up demand have supported an increase in activity across the integrated investment bank. Clients are increasingly turning to Morgan Stanley to navigate complexity, monetize opportunities and deploy capital decisively.\nIn the quarter, robust pipelines translated into announcements and credit markets were resilient and open, conducive to activity. We continue to selectively hire bankers and product specialists as the Integrated Firm culture is attracting opportunities to deepen the coverage footprint.\nOur leading equities franchise generated $4.1 billion in revenue, propelled by broad-based performance across products and regions. Prime brokerage revenues drove results as average client balances and financing revenues reached new records. Cash results were strong, reflecting active client engagement and an increase in global market volumes compared to the prior year. Derivative results were up year-over-year, driven by higher activity and regional strength in EMEA.\nFixed income revenues were $2.2 billion. The business showed consistency, driven by strong client engagement across credit and commodities, partially offset by lower results in foreign exchange. Micro results increased year-over-year. Performance was driven by strength in securitized products, benefiting from robust securitization activity and historical growth and durable lending balances.\nMacro revenue declined versus the prior year. Volatility decreased in foreign exchange markets across developed market currencies, leading to reduced client activity and trading opportunities.\nResults in commodities finished the quarter with strength, increasing year-over-year, driven by our North American Power and Gas business, which included structured transactions during the period.\nIn the quarter, ISG provisions were modest at $1 million, as a sequential improvement in the macroeconomic forecast was offset by portfolio growth in individual assessments. Net charge-offs totaled $46 million, primarily driven by commercial real estate loans that had largely been provisioned for in prior quarters.\nTurning to Wealth Management. Our franchise is growing with sustained momentum, reinforcing our industry-leading position. A record $7 trillion in total client assets, record revenues of over $8 billion and continued operating leverage drove margins to 30%. Another quarter of strong net new assets and robust fee-based flows illustrate the power of the funnel and the scale of our client base, which spans over 20 million relationships. Assets that originated from Workplace continue to migrate into our adviser-led channel as a result of the consistent investments we have made into our differentiated platform.\nWe are not standing still. In the third quarter, we continued to invest, deepening our competitive moats in areas like our expanded collaboration with Carta in private markets and in digital assets through announced partnerships with Zerohash. We continue to innovate, reinforcing our leadership in the industry and enhancing our ability to service our clients with unique capabilities.\nMoving to our business metrics. Record revenues were $8.2 billion. The business continues to demonstrate operating leverage, with the reported margin expanding to 30.3%. DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 100 basis points this quarter. Asset management revenues were a record at $4.8 billion. Fee-based flows were exceptionally strong, exceeding $40 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Transactional revenues were $1.3 billion, and excluding the impact of DCP, we're up 22% year-over-year.\nThroughout the quarter, retail clients were engaged across products and self-directed activity was particularly strong. We launched Pro -- excuse me, we launched Power E*TRADE Pro, which is a reflection of our investments to enhance our platform. These investments have helped support E*TRADE's transactional revenue, which is highly accretive to our margin.\nBank lending balances rose $5 billion sequentially to $174 billion, reflecting our multiyear investments to meet the full portfolio needs of our growing client base. In the quarter, we deepened our client penetration with lending solutions, inclusive of securities-based lending and mortgages.\nSequentially, total end period deposits grew to $398 billion and net interest income increased to $2 billion. The growth in NII was driven by the impact of our market environment and the cumulative loan growth. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to see a modest sequential gain in NII. Of course, the rate environment, trajectory of loan growth and deposit mix will all come into play.\nFinally, in the third quarter, we delivered net new assets of $81 billion, a testament to the depth and breadth of our diversified platform. All 3 channels contributed to our asset growth. The reopening of the IPO market also supported results. Further evidence that our Workplace channel serves as a powerful asset acquisition tool. This quarter, the business demonstrated exactly what it is built to do. With over 20 million relationships and $7 trillion in total client assets, our scale and connectivity sets us apart, positioning us to deliver.\nTurning to Investment Management. The business continues to perform well. We are seeing momentum for secular demand in our highly sought-after Parametric solutions and expanding our global reach in fixed income. Our investments have supported our growth to a record $1.8 trillion in total AUM, and further position the business for the opportunities ahead.\nLong-term net inflows were $16.5 billion in the quarter. Over half these inflows were driven by Parametric and further supported by ongoing strength in fixed income. Parametric inflows were inclusive of a large partnership with a third-party investment adviser, seeking greater tax efficiency for its clients.\nLiquidity and overlay services had inflows of $24.8 billion, driven by demand for our liquidity strategies. Revenues of $1.7 billion increased 13% compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by higher asset management and related fees on the back of higher average AUM. Performance-based income and other revenues were $117 million, supported by gains in infrastructure, private equity and real estate.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets grew to $1.4 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased sequentially to $536 billion as we actively supported clients. Exposures rose intra-quarter on greater levels of activity and reduced into quarter end as we syndicated risk. Our standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15.2%. We opportunistically bought back $1.1 billion of common stock in the quarter. Our quarterly tax rate was 23.6%, excluding $50 million of net discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect our fourth quarter tax rate will be approximately 24%.\nThe Firm is operating with momentum across all segments. We enter the fourth quarter from a position of strength, with a combined $8.9 trillion in total client assets, an engaged client base, healthy pipelines and global reach. We remain focused on continuing to invest in our business as we look ahead.\nAnd with that, we will now open the line up to questions.",

On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded during today's presentation. We will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us. The second quarter unfolded with two distinct halves. The first half began with uncertainty and market volatility associated with the U.S. trade policy, and the second half ended with increasing engagement and a steady rebound in capital markets. For the quarter, the firm delivered $16.8 billion in revenue, $2.13 in EPS, and an 18.2% return on tangible, completing a very strong first half of 2025, $34.5 billion in revenue, $4.73 in EPS, and a 20.6% return on tangible with six sequential quarters of durable earnings, $2.02, $1.82, $1.88, $22.2, $2.60, and $2.13. Morgan Stanley results have a cadence that reflects consistently higher levels of performance as we execute our strategy through different market and macro backdrops. The results speak to the power of our integrated firm and the alignment of the firm's leadership team. With the expectation of a more constructive regulatory backdrop.\nWe are intensely focused on generating returns on incremental capital deployment and investing for growth across the integrated firm. Globally, total client assets across wealth and investment management climbed to over $8.2 trillion, reflecting our scale and gaining ground toward our target to exceed $10 trillion in wealth. An excellent quarter. Profit before tax reached a record $2.2 billion on margins of 28%+, net new assets of $59 billion were strong despite higher seasonal tax payments, and fee-based flows of $43 billion demonstrate the value of advice amidst a complex environment and support durable growth of recurring fee-based revenues. Ongoing investments in our world-class platform, including investments to support our advisors, a build-out of E*TRADE capabilities, and the expansion of our essential workplace channel serve as an engine for future growth in investment management.\nOur leading industry-leading Parametric platform as well as strong fixed income strategies have successfully positioned this business to achieve consistent long-term inflows, generating a positive $11 billion in the second quarter. Our institutional franchise delivered revenues of $7.6 billion supported by our leading equities markets business that reached $3.7 billion top line despite a slowdown in strategic and capital markets activity for half of the quarter. Our multi-year investments in our client franchise and global footprint are yielding results. A resumption of investment banking activity in June highlighted the client's turn to Morgan Stanley as market windows reopen and serve as momentum heading into second half of 2025. Boardrooms appear more accepting of ongoing uncertainty broadly, and we are leaning into our strategy to help clients navigate bouts of volatility.\nWhile we're still in the earlier stages of the investment banking recovery, the outstanding performance in equity underwriting this quarter is a positive leading indicator. Further, while there is clearly more work to do, we are beginning to see bank regulatory reform progress. The new SLR proposal and potential for CCAR reform suggest the regulatory body continues to constructively reevaluate the total capital framework. With a CET1 ratio of 15%, we are 200 basis points plus above our forward capital requirement which affords us ongoing flexibility to deploy capital. We now have a $1 per share dividend. Incremental capital deployment will range from supporting clients, growing our businesses opportunistically, buying back stock, and evaluating inorganic opportunities where there is clear strategic alignment, all through the lens of generating strong and durable returns for our shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain constructive on the market environment.\nOur strategy to raise, manage, and allocate capital for clients across the wealth and institutional universe is working. Amidst continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we are intensely focused on continuing to deliver outstanding durable results for clients and returns for shareholders. Sharon will now take us through the quarter in greater detail. Over to you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning. In the second quarter, the firm produced revenues of $16.8 billion. Our EPS was $2.13 and our ROTCE was 18.2%. The market backdrop varied materially over the course of the quarter, impacting investor sentiment and prompting clients to seek advice and reposition portfolios in response to evolving trends and themes. Amid this backdrop, our business performed very well. We benefited from our multi-year investments to drive organic growth in wealth and investment management and to support our global footprint across the integrated investment bank. Deepening partnerships across the integrated firm positioned us well to capture momentum in the quarter. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 70%. Efficiency gains remain a product of continued prioritization of our controllable spend and savings from prior space exits, self-funding investments, and driving increased productivity by leveraging technology to support the firm's strategy.\nImproved efficiency also comes despite higher execution-related costs on the back of elevated volumes. Broadly now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues were $7.6 billion, supported by our equity and fixed income markets franchises, and, regionally, by period-over-period strength in Asia and EMEA. Results benefited from our ongoing investments in talent, global footprint, and technology, enabling us to capture activity levels and meet clients' need for advice. The underlying businesses' performance varied throughout the quarter. Our markets business captured client flow opportunities early on when activity levels were elevated. Investment banking paused for April and the first half of May, but activity recovered alongside rising asset levels. A rebound in performance of IPOs that had been priced earlier in the year supported prospective issuers to successfully come to market, further establishing investor and corporate confidence. As a result, the integrated investment bank ended the quarter with strength.\nInvestment banking revenues were $1.5 billion. Equity underwriting gained momentum following multiple years of subdued activity, and its rebound partially offset the year-over-year declines in debt underwriting, and advisory. Regionally, strength out of Asia Pacific was supported by a healthy mix of activity across equity products. Advisory revenues were $508 million, reflecting lower completed activity. Equity underwriting revenues of $500 million improved meaningfully versus the prior year, driven by broad-based strength across products. Despite a slowdown in April and much of May, convertibles, follow-ons, and IPO issuance all accelerated towards the end of the quarter as global issuers and investors gained confidence amid a market rebound. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $532 million. Results declined versus the strong comparative period primarily due to lower non-investment-grade issuance.\nThe M&A backlog continues to build across regions, with a thematic focus on growth supported by health care and technology, with a similar focus on growth companies. Our IPO pipeline is balanced between the Americas and Asia, and issuers are poised to launch subject to open markets. We have been investing in strategic hires and corporate lending to expand and deepen our coverage footprint, and our results and recent announcements prove ongoing progress as we continue to support clients who are increasingly accepting of uncertainty and in greater need for advice. We are well positioned to capture share as investment banking activity accelerates. Turning to equity, our franchise continues to deliver robust results with revenues of $3.7 billion, reflecting growth across products and regions. Volatility around changing trends and the eventual rebound in markets required client to reposition, which drove heightened engagement globally.\nPrime brokerage revenues were especially strong, achieving a record average. Client balances rose to all-time highs, driving the strength of the financing revenues. Cash results increased versus last year on higher volumes across regions, with strength in EMEA. Derivative results rose versus the previous year as the market. Excuse me, as the business actively supported clients, particularly around tariff-related market events. During the period, fixed income revenues were $2.2 billion, driven by the strength in macro products. Macro results increased versus the prior year. The business benefited from an increase in client hedging, trending foreign exchange markets, shifting interest rate expectations, and wider bid-offer spreads, particularly early in the quarter. Micro results were solid. Strength in secured lending revenues, which continue to grow on the back of higher balances, were partially offset by heightened volatility and widening credit spreads at the beginning of the quarter.\nCommodity results primarily reflected lower revenues in power and gas and fewer structured trades compared to the previous period. Other revenues were $202 million. The comparison period benefited from higher net interest income and fees on corporate loans. Turning to ISG lending and provisions in the quarter, ISG lending provisions were $168 million driven by portfolio growth and a moderately weaker macroeconomic outlook. Net charge-offs were $19 million primarily related to several commercial real estate loans which were largely provisioned for in previous quarters. Turning to wealth management, the business delivered on key metrics, strong net new assets, exceptional fee-based flows, and healthy lending growth reinforced our differentiated wealth management franchise. Revenues were $7.8 billion inclusive of $292 million of DCP and the margin continued to expand showcasing the inherent operating leverage of our scaled platform.\nResults reflect our investments focused on growth and our strong track record to help clients understand the value of advice. Moving to our business results in the second quarter, pre-tax profit was a record at $2.2 billion, and the pre-tax margin was 28.3%. DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 70 basis points. Higher margin shows strength of our asset growth achieved by our investment-led strategy. The underlying business progressed towards our long-term goal of 30%. Asset management revenues were $4.4 billion, up 11% versus the prior year, driven by higher market levels and the cumulative impact of consistently robust fee-based flows. In the quarter, fee-based flows were very strong at $43 billion, marking a record excluding previous asset acquisitions.\nClients continue to shift assets from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts, and we continue to invest in overall education, technology, and product innovation to benefit clients and support ongoing asset migration. Fee-based assets now stand at $2.5 trillion. Net new assets in the quarter of $59 billion were inclusive of a $22 billion headwind from tax outflows and reflect growth across channel. Advisor-led flows were particularly strong originating from new advisors who are attracted to the strength of the workplace as well as assets that originated from workplace.\nTransactional revenues were $1.3 billion, and excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 17% versus the last year. Retail engagement was especially strong in April as clients responded to elevated market demand. Volatility and activity persisted with momentum. At the end of the quarter, bank lending balances increased sequentially to $169 billion, predominantly driven by growth in securities-based lending. Steady growth in lending shows our progress in deepening client relationships by offering portfolio solutions addressing both sides of the client's balance sheets. Household lending penetration grew across our advisor-led channel with greater engagement from advisors and clients. Total deposits increased $383 billion, and net interest income of $1.9 billion was flat. Sequentially, these results reinforce continued stability in sweep balances. Throughout the quarter, clients steadily deployed cash into the market, indicating confidence in the forward look.\nAs we look ahead to the third quarter, we would expect NII to remain around recent levels, subject to changes in the policy rate along with $6.5 trillion of client assets. Our second quarter performance demonstrates that our strategy is working, benefiting from years of sustained investment and consistent execution. Our scale positions us to continue to innovate and invest in a secularly growing market. Today we have 20 million individual relationships across our three channels, and the opportunity to deliver incremental advice and solutions across channels, and our platform remains ahead of us. Turning to investment management, the business delivered strong results with revenues of $1.6 billion, increasing 12% year-over-year. Total AUM reached a record at $1.7 trillion. Our franchise generated positive long term net flows of $11 billion, bringing year to date inflows to $16 billion.\nStrong organic growth is the product of leveraging our global distribution with a particular emphasis in fixed income. We are also continuing to see strong demand for parametric customized portfolios, especially among our wealth management client base. Asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, driven by higher average AUM across asset class classes. Performance-based income and other revenues were $118 million, largely driven by gains in infrastructure funds. Liquidity and overlay services had outflows of $27.3 billion, reflecting institutional outflows partially related to deployment into markets and corporate CapEx. Overall, we are seeing the benefits of our investments and continued focus on global distribution capabilities. By leveraging the integrated firm, we are focused on our ability to generate sustainable growth in long-term flows and fee-based revenues. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets increased $54 billion from the prior quarter to $1.4 trillion.\nOur standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15%. Standardized RWAs increased sequentially to $523 billion as we actively supported our clients. Our stress test results reflect the durability of our business model and show consistent improvement in our results over the past five years. We announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075, bringing our quarterly dividend per share to $1. Our quarterly tax rate was 22.7%, reflecting our global mix and level of earnings. We expect a tax rate of approximately 24% in the second half of this year. Consistent with our initial guidance, the second quarter results were strong. As we look ahead, we are entering the third quarter with momentum. Investment banking pipelines are healthy, dialogues are active, and markets have proven resilient, and wealth and investment management will continue to gather assets with total client assets now reaching $8.2 trillion.\nWith that, we will now open the line up to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are now ready to take in questions. To get in the queue, you may press star and the number one on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star and the number two on your touch-tone telephone. You are allowed to ask one question and one follow-up and then we'll move to the next person in the queue. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\nWe'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Ebrahim.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Bank Research, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Good morning, Ted. I had a question. I think in your prepared comments you mentioned incremental return on capital, and as we think about whether this franchise can. You obviously have your targets out there. But when we think about this in the context of changes on the regulatory backdrop, the work you've done to integrate this franchise globally across businesses, how should we think about the incremental return on the capital? Could this be an even more profitable bank than what we have seen so far? Would love your thoughts around both in terms of what this franchise is capable of and what the regulatory environment may mean for future profitability.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, I think that is the number one question. So it's great to have you open the call with that because it's what we're much focused on, what the franchise can afford, and what the environment can afford incrementally via regulatory reform and animal spirits synchronizing around the world. Those are both clearly tailwinds. The business model as we sit here is generating earnings growth and incremental excess capital, which continues to grow our flexibility. We are as we speak deploying additional capital into the core businesses. So the organic development is happening and will continue to happen where we think there's operating leverage with smart risk architected deployment around clients. Core examples of that would be in investment banking. We've got a world class sales force coverage universe that we continue to add to. We are deepening the footprint with corporates and clients through additional credit extension.\nThere is clearly more to do there around our relationship and engagement. So investment banking is right at the top of the list along with wealth as we go into the next stage of the cycle. Second is wealth itself. I've called that out on the last number of calls with Sharon. There's more to do with these 20 million relationships that are growing every day, and in workplace around broadening our lending capabilities in a prudent way. You see the tick up year-over-year, that is going to continue to happen as we supply clients with additional breadth and depth of product.\nAnd then the third area that we are much focused on is the markets business, specifically financing businesses that are durable, where we are well known to the client and vice versa, where we can act as a leader in places like prime brokerage and secured lending. So investment banking writ large, wealth management writ large, and markets writ large. That covers a lot of the business where we can clearly put additional capital to work. That is a process that has begun, and it continues to intensify as we generate incremental capital with each passing quarter. Inside of that, there are inorganic opportunities that come by along the transom. And we are looking at them of course, but the bar is super high. We have a record of integration that is a good one. But we have humility around what it takes to make integrations work.\nSo the bar with the management team is a high one. We look at those integrations, those potential tuck-ins in the context of what the core strategy affords. Are they acquisitions that actually are near the bull's eye or better on the bull's eye and would actually help grow the core strategy across wealth and investment management, and the investment bank such that we can continue to grow capacity that way. You're hearing Ibrahim, both organic and inorganic. The specific answer to your question on the organic opportunity is that the first half affords an example of the operating leverage that the firm is able to demonstrate where the environment has been murky. When the environment stabilizes a bit, we are one prong through the three-prong administration effort.\nWe would expect areas like the M&A business and underwriting business to pick up, and that will continue to afford us additional operating leverage. So we are contributing to that. The dividend is number one and will continue to be paramount. The cadence in the increase of dividend, dating back to when it was scrip all the way to now $1 a share and a 2.8% yield at current prices, is one that we will continue to put at the top of the list for its durability and something that our core investors have come to expect as a key signpost of the core strategy itself. And then finally the buyback. We are at a $4 billion pace per annum. That is obviously a lever that we will use tactically and accordingly.\nSo that is some detail, but clearly you're hearing that we're giving this quite a bit of thought because, as you rightly point out, we printed 15% CET1. We are at 13%, with clear indications that you see from the most recent that the numbers are going in our direction on the back of continued regulatory reform. So that kind of buffer. We should be thinking about this and taking steps. And we are as we speak.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Bank Research, Bank of America\n\nThat was very comprehensive. One quick follow up, I think both Sharon and you implied there's a higher tolerance across boardrooms for the macro volatility. We are seeing some pickup in rhetoric around tariffs. Do you think this is different than what we saw in March and April where there's a huge hit to corporate sentiment around deal activity that is unlikely or less likely to happen on a go forward? Thank you.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMy sense in recent weeks is that if the, just to use the word cadence again, if the cadence of tariff policy execution is such that it is viewed to be sort of within broadly expected parameters, and obviously part of the negotiation is for the administration to optimize results, but if there's a sense that it is within sort of bands of outcome, and that the negotiation will take a certain amount of time as appropriate, but it's sort of quantifiable, that is clearly going to be a catalyst for further clearing of uncertainty. What is interesting in the last month has been that the strategic activity has really started to pick up, and in fact the strongest sponsors of the group, because as you know, sponsor activity has consolidated to the winners. They are also actually quite aggressive on the acquisition front.\nSo we are seeing real interest on the buy side from both corporates and from strategics. And clearly the fact that an IPO market on the back end is working means that the value chain seems to be in pretty good shape. So I think that if we continue along into the fall with what we saw in the last month, it should be a quite strong second half going to 2026.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning Dan.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Good morning, Ted. Wanted to follow up on your previous comments. Just around inorganic, sounds like these would be more tuck-in or complementary type of deals if they were to happen. But if you could talk to maybe financial or strategic.\nFactors that would take you over the threshold to get to completing a transaction that would be helpful.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nIt has to fit squarely within the strategy to raise, manage, and allocate capital for clients. We have a record of integration, but we are not looking to make acquisitions just for the sake of it. The opportunity set within Morgan Stanley proper is extraordinary. As you look across wealth management, the entire funnel is showing growth up and down even at this stage of uncertainty. We're seeing inflows and growth and investment management across multiple pieces. We're just getting going on the growth of Parametric in investment management and the full opportunity that underlies E*TRADE and wealth management. The investment banking franchise is a world-class franchise that after more than a dozen years of financial repression is now actually able to go out and do its thing. This has been a franchise that we have nurtured as a global business.\nWe're one of only a very small number, as you know, that are running global businesses. And the ability to execute complex cross-border strategic transactions is now right in front of us. So the organic opportunity set is enormous. If there are tuck-ins which we see many come through that can actually add to the operating leverage to the plant without actually distracting us from the opportunity set in front of us, sure we're looking at them, but the name of the game is to just continue to prosecute against the strategy deck that you saw. We are marching our way durably. Obviously, asset prices can move around, but $10 trillion, we're on our way. You see the margins in wealth; they're now in the high 20s. You see that the efficiency ratio for the first half was 70%.\nYou see that we're durably very judiciously growing share across the investment bank. That is what we set out to do, and we intend to just stick to our knitting and get that right and generate real returns and incremental capital for our shareholders.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat, that's helpful. And then Sharon, can you expand upon your comments around NNA? You highlighted new advisor strength, but maybe talk about flows more broadly and then also just the characterization of the recruiting backdrop today for new advisors joining the platform.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. Why don't we take it step by step? So just recruiting generally, I'll take it from the bottom. There's obviously a great platform. We have recruits that are interested in what we've been investing in. So that's been great to see. We talked about it in the last call. I think for NNA, which is really wonderful, is to see that we have strength in all three channels, and it's not just one channel. From the advisor-led side, we do have recruiting, but we also have flows coming in from workplace. So I've given these numbers before, but you start from a workplace perspective, and we have new flows that generate from workplace that are going into the advisor-led channel, and then those are actually also becoming fee-based flows.\nSo we're seeing that increase of the net new assets are really coming in originating from the workplace. And then we have the new flows that transfer have both the existing flows, but 70% of the flows that come from workplace that originate from workplace is actually net new assets to the firm. So that's an incredible number when you think about the net new assets and how they're generating from what we intended to see in the investments in workplace. We were looking at just a step back, not just on NNA, just so that you do have these numbers. And we used to say we had about $16 billion per year that were originating from workplace. This year we're running ahead of those numbers. It just shows you the strength of all of the channels.\nSo advisor-led is coming both from existing advisors, as well as recruits, and the origination of workplace, and then self-directed. We should talk a little bit about E*TRADE. We're seeing really great flows from the self-directed channel, year-over-year improvement there, that comes from investments in marketing and business development. We've put in new tools like E*TRADE Pro. You're seeing all of that marketing pay off across the channels. I think that understanding that this is all happening against the backdrop of a tax season is encouraging. Then the fee-based flows, which you didn't ask about but I'll just touch on, are very, very strong. Just underscoring how well the funnel is working.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Devin Ryan with Citizens Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Devin.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nDirector of Financial Technology Research, Citizens Bank\n\nGreat. Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon. I have a question on stablecoins and kind of the broader theme of tokenization. Obviously, stablecoin legislation likely to pass, probably in short order. Here, you have market structure legislation that's probably not too far behind. So, just love to hear about how you're thinking about the opportunity for Morgan Stanley. Is this something that you think could be big, or is it just kind of an evolution of market structure? And then, are there any specific areas that you're focused on as we get more regulatory clarity?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes, sure. I'm happy to take that. As you would expect, we're actively discussing it. We're looking both at the landscape and the uses, and the potential uses for our own client base. But it really is a little early to tell, especially for the businesses that we run versus businesses that you might see from competitors on how stablecoin would necessarily play in. But we're very, very close to the landscape. We're understanding this as well as the evolution across all technological advancements: AI, crypto, you name it. All of them sort of have an ecosystem that we're very focused on.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nDirector of Financial Technology Research, Citizens Bank\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. And then just to follow up on the trading environment, obviously second quarter, there's a lot going on between tariffs and geopolitical, so it's a bit hard to gauge how much maybe activity was elevated relative to repositioning for institutions compared to maybe a more normal second quarter. So just love to hear about how the market backdrop is evolving. Sharon, I heard comments about markets have been resilient in the third quarter thus far, so I'm not sure if that was a reference to trading, but just a little bit of flavor around the market backdrop. And then if you can weave in as well just some of the efforts you are taking to kind of improve market share, obviously doing more on prime brokerage as well. So love to just kind of weave that in as well for the question. Thank you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure.\nWhy don't I take again, I'll take the bottom question first. Just in terms of improvement of market share, we have been actively investing in the franchise, and that global nature is one that you can see bearing out in the results. I called out specifically even in equities this quarter, a record coming from EMEA. There have been previous quarters. We've talked a lot about Asia. And when we talk about Asia, you know, you speak about it as one region, but there are multiple countries that are involved in that. And the relationships that we have with MUFG, what we're doing in India, Greater China, all of that becomes relevant. And that is what we think of when we talk about moats around the business.\nJust where we continue to invest and see a lot of improvements in results and an ability to gain durable share in terms of client repositioning and momentum. It was not just specific to the institutional business. The retail business was extremely strong as well. I spoke about it on the April call about seeing resilience from retail engagement and a continuation of a buy the dip mentality, even through the tariffs. You'll probably remember that. And so that continued throughout the course of the quarter. It wasn't specific just to April. You saw inflows to markets from sweeps, et cetera, across the entire course of the quarter. And I even mentioned it in the liquidity flows. When you think about liquidity and IM and where those outflows went, they went into market, they went into CapEx exposure.\nSo the repositioning and the rebalancing is on the institutional side throughout the course of the quarter across the equities businesses, across the retail businesses, and across the IM business. We're there to capture all of that?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes. What I would add to that is in the case of equities, we've talked for many years about what it takes to run a global, fully laid out equities business. The old nine boxes where you have prime brokerage, derivatives, and importantly cash, and then the three regions and the cost to run that business, just dollars in the ground to turn on the lights every year. Those costs, as you know, have only gone up. And so not surprisingly, the top of the competitive heap is able to inure operating leverage and above market returns, and the rest have to slug it out just to sort of make the nut.\nWhat is remarkable about this year, or worthy of calling out, and Sharon made reference to it, is this quarter. In Europe, we had a record quarter in equities in the first half. We've had a quite extraordinary half in Asia, which is obviously Hong Kong and Tokyo led. So it's not just about the electronification of the product and the span of.\nThe product palette, but it's also the ability to run the business globally. I'd also just touch on fixed income. Not so many years ago we were talking about trying to get to $1 billion a quarter. Now fixed income has quietly put up $2 billion a quarter through every imaginable kind of environment for a whole bunch of quarters. So part of the strategy here is to not only generate operating leverage, but to impute durability in the results that actually are in line with how we want the strategy to be presented around clients. The last piece to this, which is absolutely critical, is this idea of the integrated firm where as appropriate, we are knitting clients across the platform, across the world together, whether it's in getting them access to capital, to ideas, financing strategy, the whole thing.\nAnd that is most dependent on a culture at the very top of the house, where the capital, to the earlier question, that is deployed and the resourcing that we add on is good for the franchise as a whole, as opposed to nurturing just one particular division. And that is obviously something that is years in the making, and we think will prove to be a real competitive advantage as we flex some of that incremental capital.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning, Glenn. Good morning.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nJust to follow up on that, Ted, I appreciate all the comments you made to the first question.\nI was curious a little bit about why asset management's not included in that potential deployment of capital, being that you're already great and hopefully getting greater in wealth management. Same kind of comment across banking and trading. I felt like from total dollars of capital, you could probably do the most help in terms of the asset management franchise and maybe just put that in the wrapper of how you think about balancing capital deployment and making sure asset and wealth are still the big primary identities of driving the stock and the, and the returns, you know, so that's basically a balancing the mix of businesses, if you will.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, it's actually a good pickup there. That wasn't, that wasn't intentional. In fact, the investment management numbers this quarter, as you know, were really quite outstanding with $11 billion of inflows. And then the continued growth of Parametric, I think it's fair to say that the opportunities across investment management, which is your question, Glenn, on sort of a standalone basis, given the fragmentation of the industry and given how some folks are doing a lot better than others, there are many, many acquisition opportunities in the asset management space. As you are well aware, we are being very careful about that to the extent we can add.\nAn Eaton Vance.\nBefore people have figured out what Parametric is all about, or we can make an acquisition of Solium before people understand that that is the linchpin to workplace. If we can add E*TRADE as filling out the funnel. I think part of the thinking is to not only imagine what the asset is worth in and of itself, but what the platform effect to the core strategy is from being inside the wealth funnel or being inside the investment management universe. And I think you know well that investment management rollups have had very mixed experience. So to the extent that we can bring in a strategy or bring in a business that fits with Morgan Stanley culture, that fits with our client perspective, and can afford us incremental operating leverage, well, sure, that would absolutely check a whole bunch of boxes.\nIt could give us incremental margin, clearly additional AUM. But I am much focused, Glenn, on folks hearing that. First and foremost, we're really focused on what is in front of us in our operating and management committee and leadership meetings around the firm every day because there is a ton of demand for incremental capital, incremental resources that is coming straight from clients, through our people to us. So the nurturing of what we have in the core strategy of raise, manage, and allocate capital to clients affords us a heck of a lot of runway. But you're right, there are investment management strategies and opportunities. Some of them are very clear, and some of them may be more hidden gems like a Solium, which I thought was ingenious, that can be brought in to actually help transform where the firm is going to go with clients.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nI appreciate that. Sharon, if I could ask a quick follow up on your comment around NII, around steady and the current rate backdrop. There's like five or so rate cuts expected through now, through the end of next year. I mean, you have offsets. Your business probably does well if rates are going down. But can you talk about NII in a forward curve setting or however else we should think about the balancing of lower rates?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. I won't give specific guidance, as you probably expect, Glenn, as it relates to next year. But I will highlight too that as you use the word offsets, yes, generally speaking, in a lower rate environment we see inflows, right, of sweeps. So I think that there are places that you can certainly better understand where we are today and we look ahead. I've stated that we're in a similar range largely because we haven't really seen sweeps move and you're in a position where there are stable rates. But what you will also gain over time is the increase in from lending balances, which is why I've paid.\nYou know, I spent a lot of time talking about that in the prepared remarks because in my mind that's an incredible forward-looking indicator for just the strength of the business and how we've seen an increase in household penetration from a lending perspective. So more and more, both advisors and users are thinking about our lending product on the wealth management side as it will play out specifically from an interest rate perspective. And sweeps, those will be likely factors that will be driven by the policy rate. But yes, generally speaking, when rates do go down, we generally see sweeps balances broadly go up.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. I just want to ask about.\nA trend of more lending through the capital markets division.\nIn other words.\nTed, you talked about the moment of wow on your last presentation that was memorable to me. I think one wow to me is just the extent that banks used to lend directly to the commercial customers, and now they're lending more to non-bank financial firms than directly lending to those traditional commercial customers. My question is how do you see that trend, where it's been, where it's going, and how much lending do you do through your capital markets business as a percentage of the whole? It's all kind of jumbled together, and those of us on the outside have a tough time quantifying that.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's an interesting one, Mike. I do think you're touching on.\nWe have to see how the regulatory environment plays out. I think we sort of sense that, you know, the 15-year dam is breaking, and that reform is in the offing. We've seen indications of that in SLR, as you know, and recent strong results from the group.\nIn this recent CCAR exam, I do think that some of the share that we ceded as an industry group at the top, the big banks writ large, the, you know, the six of us, that in part was a function of, you know, regulatory limitation broadly, and that regulatory limitation may well be normalizing. That will not so much dollar for dollar take share back from the private lending group because I think the private credit product has found its place. It is institutionalized, as you know, it's at $2 trillion and growing.\nI think the ability for the highly capitalized global investment banks, especially if they have something special along with it, in our case, as you know, world-class wealth and investment management businesses, will be able to get back after that core share around corporate product in the mid-cap space with corporate derivatives to unsecured but high-quality borrowers where perhaps we've been competed out to be more soup to nuts on acquisitions and complex events. There will still be a role for others to continue to flourish in the boutique space. The winners will continue to be winners, and there will be clearly a role for the sponsor community to do its thing. I think the, I don't want to say the balkanization of some of our core activities inside of the securities business and corporate investment bank amongst the big group.\nI think you may begin to see, and you've indicated this, the tide may begin to shift where we can begin to again play a more central role in governing the stewardship of the corporate and sponsor capital markets, acting as financier, as structure, and of course as appropriate as the distribution and allocation engineering. I think we've got, of course, that back end in a special way. I think the front end has been splintered because there have been limitations that have been brought to the group. There's so much they can do. I think it is clear, and this ties to the earlier answer with respect to organic or inorganic. Any kind of normalization of the regulatory environment is going to afford the largest and most well-capitalized and global firms a lot of running room to prosecute core lending product with sophisticated clients.\nThe largest, most sophisticated, highest net worth individuals are walking institutions. We have folks that are in the ecosystem who act as competitors, clients, frenemies, but they can also get incremental capacity from us. Our intention, I think, would be to be competing for additional depth with those key top ecosystem players where we do not have to worry as much about hitting.\nA limit that is sort of preordained from notional limits that were prescribed a decade plus ago. I think it's an evolving process. We want to do that prudently. We are well aware of bouts of volatility, we're aware of sort of risk architecture. So we're in no rush to do that, which is why we are so focused on the cadence of earnings. There's a sense of consistency in who we're lending to, how we're growing the product, how we're delivering on deposits. It's all part of sort of the broader mosaic of getting to 20% returns on tangible on an ongoing basis.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, that was very helpful, thank you.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Erika,\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning.\nJust two follow up questions. First for you, Ted, on all the inorganic opportunity. When investors see your returns, they say, oh, how does an optimized teaming business continue to optimize itself? I heard you talk about inorganic. I was wondering where deposits would play into your priority. I know that you have less than 10% of trading assets in the bank sub, and some of your peers have 30%-60%. I'm wondering where that would fall on your priority list.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI'll give Sharon this one. Go ahead.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. Erica, I think it's a really great point, and I think it's something we've been very focused on. As you know, and I know you've written a lot about the usage of the bank. The bank is clearly a priority for us. We put it into the strategic objectives purposefully to really talk about the fact that we see more potential growth as we think about eligibility. You obviously do need both sides of that balance sheet for us in terms of deposits. We have grown and continue to grow and diversify our deposit base, which will allow us to support ongoing growth of eligible assets that we could put on the bank. This is a strategic objective. I think that it is something that we see real potential for as we move forward.\nIt will take time to really make sure that we do it the right way with the right infrastructure. What you've certainly seen is that over the course of the last 10 years we've put a lot of investment into the bank product, into what we have to make ourselves a real bank that has the ability to service both sides of that balance sheet.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nLet me take the first half of your question, which is on the back of what Sharon just said.\nThere shouldn't be a conflation around.\nHaving a strategy that is clear, consistent, and well understood, and a sense that we have no more runway on that strategy. The runway on that strategy is just effectively a byproduct of addressing enormous TAMs with large barriers to entry. On the one hand, you have a $6 trillion world-class wealth management business, but the current TAM is at least $60 trillion. We are the leader, but we only have 10% share. In the investment bank, we are a global leader. We have 15% share. Both of those businesses, as you know, are secular growers. In the investment management business, we are working away to grow our real assets business, our private credit businesses, our liquidity businesses. Those businesses now, on an organic basis, have the kind of runway where a very good argument could be made across.\nI give you examples in all three divisions, and inside of infrastructure as well, where the best answer may be to just hew to the core strategy of raise, manage, and allocate capital by continuing to invest in those businesses, to grow them through the power of AI, but also through the extension of credit, and to work closer with clients. It may also be the case, though, that inorganic opportunities come across the transom that give us incremental perspective or breadth. The bar is quite high, not because we're not sure what we want to do next, but in fact because we do know what we want to do next. The best use of capital is probably to continue to hammer away inside of the business, given that the level of excess capital that we hold is incrementally growing at this point in the cycle.\nIf something comes through that is additive to the capability that we already have, we're going to go and do that. The IM example referencing back to Glenn's question is an appropriate one, where we have pockets of build that are going to pay off for five, 10 years with durable streams where we may not need to go inorganic. We may be able to just hew to the organic, but the inorganic opportunity being folded inside of the organic build is the likely way we are going to go.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Welcome to Morgan Stanley's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call on behalf of Morgan Stanley. I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded during today's presentation. We will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us. The firm delivered a very strong quarter with $17.7 billion in revenue, $2.60 in EPS, and a 23% return on tangible common equity. Added $94 billion of net new assets, bringing the firm total to $7.7 trillion. Equities had a record $4 billion+ quarter, which led to strong results across institutional securities. Morgan Stanley delivered returns while supporting clients, buying back stock opportunistically, and building $2 billion of capital. Over the last five quarters, we've grown our equity capital base by about 10% with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%. Our excess capital position and financial strength give us ongoing flexibility in support of clients and shareholders. It is important that we put up five clean quarters. Our focus on clients combined with discipline around capital, risk, headcount, and investment have generated sequential earnings of $2.02, $1.82, $1.88, $2.22, and.\nNow $2.60. This was against a backdrop that was generally favorable, but one that hasn't yet seen the tailwind of the long-awaited M&A and IPO capital market cycle. Delivering an average of 20% returns on tangible over the last five quarters is continued affirmation of our financial goals.\nWe've been talking for the last three years about the end of the end of history, which is to say the end of an extended period of political and economic alignment toward globalization. History now resumes, and with that comes an adjustment period where the outlook is necessarily less predictable. The stock, bond, and currency markets are exhibiting the kind of overnight and intraday volatility that reflect rapidly changing probability assessments of different policy outcomes. Economists are telling us the risk of recession has materially increased, but the consensus today is softer, not negative growth. Inflation, meanwhile, continues to swing between declining and sticky, but here too, the forward path of prices along the supply chain to producers and consumers is unclear.\nThe simple truth today is that we do not yet know where trade policy will settle, nor do we know what the actual transmission effects will be on the real economy. As the year progresses, markets will calibrate further clarity on trade policy against the tax and deregulatory pillars of the agenda as the US endeavors to rebalance the fiscal equation and assert the national interest.\nGiven this unpredictability, some clients are deferring strategic activity while others are proceeding. Importantly, core segments of our client universe are continuing to engage. Barring the worst case risk off scenario, trade and geopolitical uncertainty will be priced into the markets over time, and the raising, managing, and allocating of capital, the lifeblood of our business, will continue. As corporates and investors cannot and will not ignore their trade, energy, and technology priorities in volatile periods, windows to deploy and reallocate capital open and close and open again. It is in such moments that clients most value Morgan Stanley's global reach and depth, our insights and advice, our capital markets access, and our execution capabilities.\nThe Morgan Stanley of today is in a very good place. It is worth noting that we just delivered a top line and bottom line record quarter. While we are rightly focused on near-term uncertainties and disruptions in the markets, our approach is to prudently plan for the longer-term horizon. Our strategy to raise, manage, and allocate capital for clients is crisp, and it is clear we have an experienced and stable management team and a deep bench of talent that is focused on that which we can control. We have financial strength and durability. We have a culture of rigor, humility, and partnership across our integrated firm.\nWith a demonstrated track record of execution and now five strong quarters in, I am confident that Morgan Stanley will navigate this moment of history as it's resuming with focus and intensity, and that the firm will continue to scale client wallet and drive long-term operating results.\nWith that I'll turn it over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in more detail.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning.\nThe firm produced record revenues of $17.7 billion, an EPS of $2.6 with a strong ROTCE of 23%. The results demonstrate the power of advice and supporting clients as the intermediary of capital across products and geographies, particularly during periods of uncertainty.\nWith a long-standing global footprint, we.\nAre uniquely positioned to serve clients as they navigate global market events and quickly evolving macro dynamics. The Q1 efficiency ratio was 68%. Strong revenues and a continued focus on creating capacity to invest in longer-term initiatives contributed to results. Improved efficiency comes despite $144 million of severance charges, which were related to performance management and the alignment of our business needs now to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered a record quarter with revenues of $9 billion, up 28% versus the prior year. The breadth of our capabilities and our geographic reach, particularly in our equity franchise and in Asia, drove exceptional performance.\nGlobal activity among financial sponsors increased, supporting a steady recovery in investment banking from trough levels. Market catalysts such as shifting dynamics in AI, uncertainty around global monetary policy, and US trade debates created bouts of volatility during the quarter leading to high levels of client activity and engagement. Against this backdrop, Morgan Stanley advised and supported clients as they rebalanced risk. Consistent with our strengths and our business model, investment banking revenues were $1.6 billion for the quarter. Strength in fixed income underwriting offset results in equity underwriting.\nAdvisory revenues of $563 million reflected higher completed deals across regions. Activity during this period was supported by a pickup in financial sponsor engagement and growth in mid-sized deal announcements. Equity underwriting revenues were $319 million. Equity markets were largely open, but activity was muted as issuers and investors evaluated the evolving landscape, particularly in the Americas.\nFixed income underwriting delivered revenues of $677 million. The result was very strong with non-investment-grade loan issuance driving outperformance. Strong investor demand and tight credit spreads supported active issuance, providing opportunities for our business to capture share during the quarter, with tariff announcements and subsequent market volatility. Excuse me. While tariff announcements and subsequent market volatility has disrupted near-term deal activity, our pipelines have not meaningfully changed since the beginning of the year and remain robust. Therefore, while the timing of the deal execution remains sensitive to market conditions, there remains demand for strategic advice and capital raising. Turning to equity, revenues were robust, increasing 45% from the prior year to a record $4.1 billion. The quarter reflects strength across our client franchise, a broad and deep global footprint, prudent risk management, and returns on our multi-year investments across products contributed to results.\nGlobally. We helped clients remain agile amid shifting market themes. Prime brokerage continued to report strong results. Clients remain engaged and invested. Our cash business benefited from volumes increasing across regions. Derivatives revenues were meaningfully up versus the prior year. The result reflects higher client activity amid a more volatile trading environment. Fixed income revenues were $2.6 billion, improving versus the prior year. An increase in flow trading activity offset fewer structured opportunities. Macro revenues increased versus the prior year. The business navigated higher market volatility well, particularly in foreign exchange where client activity increased across products relative to last year. Micro revenue declined slightly as tighter credit spreads limited secondary market opportunities versus the comparative period. This was partially offset by higher loan balances and an increase in securitization activity.\nOther revenues increased to $692 million primarily driven by realized gains on the sale of corporate loans held for sale. Turning to ISG lending and provisions in the quarter, ISG provisions were $91 million. This reflected portfolio growth alongside a more cautious outlook in response to the volatile macro backdrop. In the first quarter, net charge-offs were approximately $23 million primarily related to commercial real estate loans in the office sector which were largely already provisioned for. Turning to wealth. The business delivered very strong results in the quarter across metrics. Revenues of $7.3 billion, reported margin of 27%, $94 billion in net new assets, and consistently strong fee-based flows of $30 billion. Retail clients remain engaged. Strong transactional activity, increased unsolicited trading, and ongoing migration into fee-based accounts demonstrate client participation and the demand for advice amid heightened volatility.\nClient asset levels across the franchise remained strong at $6 trillion of assets. Fee-based assets were largely unchanged compared to the end of the year at $2.3 trillion, highlighting the diversified nature of the advisor-led fee-based account flows.\nPre-tax profits was $2 billion and the reported PBT margin was 26.6%. The margin was negatively impacted by 174 basis points related to DCP and severance-related costs. Net new assets for the quarter were strong at $94 billion, representing a 6% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. The result was supported by broad-based strength across channels inclusive of elevated flows related to advisor-led clients, stock plan vesting events, positive recruiting trends, and self-directed clients. Asset management revenues were $4.4 billion up 15% year-over-year reflecting higher market levels and the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. Fee-based flows remain strong at $30 billion. Two dynamics continue to play through our results. First, fee-based flows in the quarter were again supported by assets migrating from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts.\nSecond, assets migrating to the Advisor-led channel that originated from the Workplace channel. As these relationships grow with an incremental $20 billion this quarter, adding to the roughly $300 billion accumulated from Workplace since we expanded our channel in 2020, transactional revenues were $873 million, and excluding the impact of DCP were up 13% versus the prior year. The first quarter's results were supported by higher levels of client activity, evidenced by strong daily average trades that have continued to rise despite recent uncertainty. Bank lending balances increased $3 billion quarter-over-quarter to $163 billion, driven by balanced demand across products. During the quarter, we saw a pickup in securities-based lending balances likely to satisfy upcoming tax obligations.\nTotal deposits of $375 billion were up quarter-over-quarter as demand for our savings offering was partially offset by the modest decline in sweep balances. Within sweeps, we saw clients consistently deploy cash into markets during each month of the first quarter. Overall deposit movements in the quarter were generally in line with seasonality and our expectations. Net interest income was up modestly quarter-over-quarter to $1.9 billion. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect a seasonal decline in sweeps related to tax payments, which would result in a modest decline in NII. However, over the course of the recent two weeks, we have seen a notable increase in sweep balances exceeding our internal forecasts. While this is likely associated with recent market uncertainty, it could have offsetting impacts to the NII in the second quarter.\nShould this continue for the second quarter, deposit mix will remain the key driver of NII. Our wealth franchise sets the industry standard where both clients and advisors recognize the power of our platform. Clients continue to entrust us with more of their assets, reinforcing the value they place on advice. Advisor recruitment remains strong, reflecting our reputation as an exceptional place where financial advisors can grow their businesses. Looking towards the year ahead, uncertainty has increased the value of advice and our diversified capabilities. We are confident that our business will deliver durable results throughout various market environments. Moving to Investment Management, reported revenues were $1.6 billion, increasing 16% versus the prior year. Results reflected higher asset management and related fees driven by higher average AUM. Total AUM ended at $1.6 trillion. Long-term net inflows were $5.4 billion in the quarter.\nThe inflows were driven primarily by Parametric and fixed income and were supported by our efforts to expand distribution of these products within alternatives and solutions. Parametric continues to grow as demand for customized direct indexing and tax-advantaged solutions remains a key source of retail client engagement. Liquidity and overlay services had outflows of $19 billion. These outflows were consistent with seasonal trends but were more moderate than we had previously expected. Performance-based income and other revenues were $151 million, supported by gains in several infrastructure investments. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.3 trillion during the period. We accreted $1.9 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and continued to deliver to our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Buying back $1 billion of common stock during the quarter.\nStandardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter, consistent with seasonal trends and active support of our clients. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of 15.3%, underscoring our strong capital position. Our Q1 tax rate was 21%. The lower rate was supported by share based award conversions which largely take place in the Q1.\nThis quarter's results underscore the strong and consistent performance we strive to deliver in active markets. As a trusted advisor to our broad global client base, we continue to benefit from the strength of our integrated firm. Our client-driven model combined with strong capital and liquidity positions us to support clients as they navigate the uncertain landscape. With that, I will open the line up to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are now ready to take in questions. To get in the queue, you may press star and the number one on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star and the number two on your touchtone telephone. You are allowed to ask one question and one follow up and then we'll move to the next person in the queue. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\nWe'll take our first question from Steven Chubok with Wolfe Research.\n\nStephen Chubok\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning Steve.\n\nStephen Chubok\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nMorning. So, Ted, I wanted to start off with one on the equities trading outlook. Just given your experience overseeing the business, you know the recent strength has been pretty extraordinary, and the updates from you and a peer suggest the trading's actually been pretty orderly amid the recent volatility. I was hoping you could just speak to the factors that might support continued durability of the recent strength and some of the variables you're monitoring that could potentially derail some of the recent momentum as well.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSteve, love your question. Great quarter. Client activity across the nine boxes, all three products, all three regions, everything clicked. We've made the investments in clients, in technology, across high touch and electronic cash, across prime brokerage, and in both the flow and derivative products and across each major region. Those are the nine boxes, the cash business as you know, the prime brokerage business, and the derivatives business in each of the three regions.\nAnd they all clicked. I feel really good about the business and its leadership under Alan Thomas and Gokul Laroia. They've done a hell of a job. It is fundamentally activity based. The bear case would be weaker economy, weaker sentiment, that is the animal spirits going to hibernation. That would be consistent with lower prices, negative manager performance, and that brings lower transaction levels, lower leverage levels, lower new issue activity.\nBut that's not where we are. Markets are off, but clients remain much engaged, high volumes in every region. We have big market share in Asia, as you know, high two-way market views as we're living through over the last number of days, and new issue market that may pause but is still in the pipeline. So the upshot is that $4 billion is a very big number, but the run rate has been higher than what we'd seen a couple years ago. And it makes sense as we continue to consolidate share; we're clearly continuing to take share with the right technology, the right mix of client business, and the right focus on returns around the world. So it's a winner, and insofar as we don't go risk-off, it'll continue to be a winner. And I'm super proud of the team.\n\nStephen Chubok\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for that perspective, Ted, and maybe for my follow-up for Sharon just on the NNA outlook. So the flows were certainly more durable than we and others had anticipated. The market deterioration admittedly was a bit more back-end loaded, and it has accelerated into April. So I was hoping you could speak to the durability of the NNA strength just given some of the negative marks we've seen in both fixed income and equities. And you noted cash has been much more resilient in April. But I was hoping you could also speak to what you're seeing across lending and margin, particularly margin, which is more equity or beta sensitive.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. So let me start first by the NNA because I think the story there is actually really encouraging when you look under the hood. As you know, we have three channels. We have Workplace, we have self directed.\nWe have advisor-led last year.\nIf you compare it a year ago, and I know it was a strong first quarter last year, but we talked about individualized flows in the first quarter.\nOf last year, we didn't discuss that.\nHere because it was a much more broad-based. We had year-over-year growth in each of those three segments. So stock plan was an increase on the self-directed side. We have been investing, and you can see it even in our expense numbers on our marketing and our investment in our self-directed platform. There has been an increase in the assets that we are seeing in that platform, which is encouraging on the back of those investments. And on the advisor-led side, it's multiple clients in multiple different sectors that you're actually seeing those flows come in, and we're also seeing flows from the recruiting side. So all of that in my mind is quite encouraging that we're seeing the benefits of the investments that we've been making into that platform over multiple years, including even the most recent last year.\nAs it relates specifically to the cash.\nAnd the stocks that you mentioned. In terms of the SBLs, I was encouraged by the SBL lending lines that we saw in the growth over the course of the first quarter. If you look back over the course of the last two years or so, there's been more muted growth, especially going into taxes. Historically we had seen individuals using their BDP specifically for paying those taxes or money market cash. The fact that we've seen an increase in SBL, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks ahead of tax season, I think is encouraging that we have reached, at least from a transactional lever, what could be an equilibrium and in periods of say a risk off, etc., you might actually begin to see increases in those balances, which I noticed that we had seen higher than expected levels over the course of these last two weeks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Christian.\n\nOperator\n\nChristian, your line is now open.\n\nChristian Bolu\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOops, sorry about that.\nI was on mute. Can you hear me? Okay, now.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWe got you.\nWe weren't at all offended. We were just wondering how big the question's gonna be. Man.\n\nChristian Bolu\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nYeah, I was talking to myself for a while there. Sorry.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI know what that's like.\n\nChristian Bolu\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nSo to follow up on Steven's question around maybe more broadly on trading, just exceptional results here. Clearly the markets are very volatile, and that volatility has stepped up in April. So maybe talk about how you're managing risk, and then are you taking down exposures or are you still playing offense? And then any sort of color on prime brokerage balances in April and what you're seeing from hedge fund clients?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, broadly.\nThe first quarter.\nFlows into the second quarter. There is a lot of client interaction and the animal spirits are still there, insofar as folks are trying to not get caught offside. So there's natural volatility that we're seeing, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, in every space and within equity. So the basic market making function, which is the bread and butter of the cash business, both voice and electronic, continues to be very strong. You're speaking to the prime brokerage business there; we continue to be a leader. And sure, if clients begin to go negative or they need to delever, well, by definition lower balances are the result, which results over time in lower P&L. But you know, much of the client base, Christian, as you know.\nMost folks are closer to the zero barrier than they are a number that is well off of that. So they have a lot to play for, and given the swings and given the intellectual capital that exists with the asset management community, they're going to look to continue to engage. There's plenty of stock dispersion that manifests itself in the derivatives markets, as you know, lots of way to play, lots of ways to play across asset macro. So that brings together our equities and fixed income folks to put together structured product. So there's lots of reason to think that the equities business and the markets business generally will continue to be active.\nThe question over time will be, at what point does the uncertainty result in a knockout of the new issue business, and volumes will slow on the back of just a continued sense of uncertainty, and you see then gap year markets and lower volumes. But we're not seeing that. There is plenty of market making going on. You know, the first quarter of course is typically a seasonal winner across the street because clients need to initially allocate, but they continue to allocate. So I'm feeling good about that broadly, and I think our own experience has been one where things have been orderly. We've been working with.\nClients nonstop, and for all of the concerns about what could come down the road in the real economy, the market making and the ability to transact to clients as they up and down their leverage levels has been, has been very orderly. So engagement is key here, and engagement continues.\n\nChristian Bolu\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nVery helpful. Maybe a question on Asia and kudos to the team for doing a good job on building out strength across regions, particularly in Asia. And, I'm guessing all of that is Japan and the MUFG partnership. But bigger picture, if, if we are deglobalizing and there is a decoupling of US from Asia broadly, how do you think about the prospects of your international business?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nBullish.\nThe power of a global business is to. I hate the cliché, sort of HBR cliché here, but you know, think global, act local. And I think that has application in our Asia business broadly across the investment management, high net worth wealth businesses, which have had a great, great run here in Hong Kong. But then importantly the institutional securities business, which is actually about 15% of our firm revenues this past quarter and was up 35% year-over-year. So real strength. We have something special, Christian, with our friends and partners in Tokyo. We will have our next board meeting in Tokyo. In fact, a business summit with the leadership in Japan. So we intend on continuing to expand that extraordinary partnership with MUFG.\nThat is a multi-decade play, we hope, both in the institutional context and in the wealth context. We have a significant business in India that is a place where we have the better part of 12,000 people. We will continue to build our capability both as an infrastructure matter, but also as a securities matter. Then, Greater China, we have 2,500 people out of Hong Kong, out of the 17,500 people that we have in Asia. So taking a step back, we have 80,000 people at the firm, 17,500 of them are in Asia. So this is existential to what we do. 2,500 of those people are in Hong Kong. We're not a big corporate lender onshore in China, but we interact via Hong Kong actively.\nWe continue to be a leader both in the investment banking business and in the markets business in recent quarters, clearly in equities where clients want to get access to the mainland and to that second largest economy and stock market and liquidity center in the world. We continue to be a point of market access and interaction. We pay attention to it, Christian, as you can imagine, actively, but day and night because things constantly move around. But we're feeling really good about our continued engagement with the client base, locally based, but also on a global basis. And I think when we look back at this period, 10 years, 15 years from now, when you and I are having this chat.\nWe will see a Morgan Stanley that indeed has a significant international business. I could spend five minutes talking about our business in Europe. I will simply say that we've continued to invest both in the UK and on the continent. We are a determined player to be part of the next global order, both in the wealth and investment management business, but really in the global institutional securities business. As you know, Christian, one of the realities of financial repression was that the cost of running a global investment bank was pretty tough to make the return on capital nut very tough. So, to have gotten here now with the kind of bankers and markets folks and infrastructure through all of the panoply of regulation throughout Europe and internationally to get to this point now where we can slowly take share to durably take share.\nYou saw that we put into the firm-wide goals to durably increase share across the investment bank. That is not a quarter or even year phenomenon. That is a multi-year phenomenon where we think that there will be, of course, national championships, but there will be several global winners that are able to transact in the businesses where we do real well, which is trusted advisor on M&A, trades on underwritings, and then importantly market making, and then flow through to net worth where it exists principally in the US. So I am really quite bullish on our international business, and we will navigate the next number of months and quarters.\nWith care. The determination as a long-term matter is not only undaunted, but we will push forward.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey Ebrahim.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. I guess maybe Ted, so maybe it's just me, but you sound fairly constructive given what we've come through over the last month, your comments on both on the trading side and how clients have behaved and what we've seen in wealth. It doesn't seem to be the case that we've seen a marked deterioration in the last week or the last couple of weeks relative to super strength earlier in the quarter. Is that a fair assessment? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it goes to the fact that if that's the case, the business is a lot more resilient than investors probably give credit for. So just want to make sure we are thinking about it in the right way. You mentioned things about like if folks go into hibernation, etc. I'm surprised that they haven't already.\nSo, just want to make sure, so far, given all what we've seen in the market, you've not really felt any negative adverse impacts operating or on the wealth side?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell.\nFundamentally the banking pipeline hasn't changed.\nSome clients are naturally going to pause, they've hit the pause button, and others are a go. There is, as you know, you spend time looking at sponsor and corporate activity. There are financial sponsors buying and selling as we speak, Honeywell, Warburg Pincus, you know, Bayer, Clearlake, Dun & Bradstreet. So there are sponsors buying and selling assets. So they will continue to play, as well, corporates. It's just going to have to be against the reality of this uncertainty. If the uncertainty can be navigated and priced into the market, there is progress on these complicated issues, then folks, I imagine will respond to that and factor it in as part of their execution risk formula.\nNow, clearly, if we go risk off, which is to say things really become so unpredictable that you don't know where a stock price is going to be within 10% or 20%, you don't know where an FX cross is going to be within 5% or 10%, and so on with interest rates. Well, I mean, by definition then activity will stop. I mean, that is just the definition of risk off, as you know. But insofar as there is still, we are early here and we're talking about the rearchitecting of industrial policy in the context of America's place in the world and where it wants to be decades from now. That is weighty stuff, but it may well be that that takes some time for some of the bilateral negotiations.\nBut in other contexts, actually some deals are put on the table, in which case people are going to want to move forward because it is our view that the underwriting and M&A pipeline street-wide, by the way, it's not a Morgan Stanley phenomenon. This is the leadership of that product area is ready to go. And if windows open, whether those windows are open over a weekend or for a week or in fact for quarters or there's a sense that in fact there's relief because we get through this period and we get towards the next two pillars, tax and dereg. I can see clients continuing to move and we will continue to prosecute business. So that's the long answer. The short answer is in the opening of the quarter, we have not seen a slowdown.\nIs it bumpier for some clients? Of course it is. And we have to see how they respond to that over the course of the weeks and months to come. But we are, we are still, we'll call it cautiously optimistic that we won't go into recession and we will just keep going.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful color, thank you. Maybe Sharon, for you, there's obviously a lot of discussion around changes to the SLR ratio. Just remind us, how impactful could that be for how you manage the balance sheet and just how you manage the business? Is it a needle move, or standalone, or how do you think about that?\nThank you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, so I think that it's hard to. I wouldn't take SLR only in isolation. I will answer your question directly first, but I will give you a little bit more holistic answer, which is SLR has been over various quarters our binding constraint. And so certainly if there's SLR reform, then we will move into a CET1 constrained world, and that provides us with additional opportunities as you think about capital deployment. That being said, it depends on what SLR reform you see, right? Whether or not it's simply just to allow certain.\nThings like treasuries into the denominator, how you think about that, or whether there's a more wholesale understanding that SLR should not be, it should certainly be just a backstop and not a binding constraint for an institution. What we feel is probably more important than SLR specifically is just to look at the entire capital regime. So when you think about the interplay between G-SIB, between SLR, and between the various CET1 metrics, i.e., the type of reform one should look at because they actually don't play necessarily that well together, given that there have been incremental changes simply to one metric versus the other.\nFrom our perspective, one should be.\nLooking at everything holistically. But yes, obviously we do welcome regulatory reform and we welcome reform to the SLR ratio.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSLR becomes part of the mechanism, potentially, for some of the relief here broadly, may or may not happen. But to Sharon's point, I think what we are interested in here and as an industry is SLR reform in the context of the panoply of regulation that we have sort of endured, whether it's G-SIB, CCAR, LCR, Basel III Endgame, the entire panoply of acronyms.\nThe SLR reform might be part of the cocktail in the short term, but really we would look for reform broadly, and we're much prepared for that. And again, Ebrahim, just to sort of put an emphasis on this, we can't make a call on where the markets are going to be a week from now. I mean, that would be absurd for us to know that. So in a sense there is increased uncertainty. So any strategic transaction is by definition going to get a harder look. What I'm trying to underscore here though is that.\nLargely what we're seeing is some folks still going, but the others pausing. They're not deleting, they're pausing. So yes, that could result in some of the IPO stack moving out a quarter or two. It could be that some M&A activity moves out a stack or two. But this is not a question of people rethinking their priorities around technology, energy, competitive dynamics within their industry. So that is why we continue to push forward on this theme that we are going to be in an investment banking cycle and the fact that the markets business continues to be as active as it is is a pretty good ballast against that within ISG.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Dan.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Question on just the advisor business and the market backdrop like this with the last few weeks in terms of volatility. What does that mean for recruitment and retention trends? And also, does that change the appetite for fee-based flows as you think about going forward and your goals around increasing that metric?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, people are coming toward the platform. Jed Finn and Vince Lumia's lights are blinking, as in their phone lights, nonstop. Folks want to come onto this platform.\nAnd that is in part because the funnel works. We're investing in E*TRADE. The self-directed channel is very busy. Sharon, at length, has talked about, as have I, the Workplace product where we added another $20 billion. You see the progress in fee-based flows, but ultimately when you get to the top of the funnel it is about the financial advisor. And the financial advisor is seeing the integrated firm for what it is, which is we can offer unique access to intellectual capital, world-class technology.\nCompensation that is viewed to be fair and motivating, and the entire thing works. So what's happening is we are selective about it, but it is fair to say that Jed and Vince are getting a lot of inbound inquiry, and we would expect that to continue.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Then just as a follow-up, sticking with wealth. The opportunity for alternatives in the wealth channel is clearly a focus for the large alternative managers. Can you talk about your own proprietary alternative products that you might be able to sell within this channel? Or is that something you could think about inorganically wanting to get bigger in in terms of your own proprietary products?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. I'd note for the wealth management.\nPlatform, we have over $200 billion of private alternatives. It's about if you take that into perspective in terms of what the qualified assets are, we have about 5% of the qualified assets in our system are in those private alternatives. Now that compares to your point where our GIC, where we have our global investment committee, the recommendation is closer to 15% for those qualified investors. So there certainly is opportunity there. We're working on products from our perspective as well as obviously others are doing it. But we are looking also at places to help fill these gaps and to help you provide a more democratized offering.\nSo it's certainly a focus.\nIt's something that you'll see come through. We think that there's great opportunity there for us and more broadly just for those alternatives across the platform to go to our retail client base.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning, Glenn.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGood morning.\nSo we've all applauded all the great trading which is actually awesome. I'm very curious. When you guys are going through the pretty good draconian stress tests, the stress test will always spit out pretty bad answers for what any big investment bank does on the trading side. You're doing literally the opposite of that right now. So I'm curious when you look at the composition of those tests and then you look at the reality of how you perform, and I know it's not like every day and you can't predict the future, but like, I'm curious on what's different about the setup, how you might suggest tweaking it because I know every June when we go through the results, they're way different than reality.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo in terms of the underlying stress test, you're obviously going to pick different portions of the what that environment would be. What we do versus what the Fed does for our own individual stress test will be different. We will test ourselves on where we think that we would have the most vulnerabilities. I think that the challenges that when you look at the underlying test is really the uncertainty and the build on build of both previous years and the.\nFact that you're, if you think about.\nThe way, and we've said this in the past publicly, if you think about the way that these test results come out, you're giving something more along the lines of in June, and you're moving forward to having to execute them in October. There's also very limited amounts where, when you think about the test from an industry perspective that looks at each of how the individual companies do. So it's a blanket exam rather than, when we look at our own stress test, it's modeled to our businesses and things that necessarily make sense for us and what our clients do and what we see. So I think that the Fed has obviously said that they're interested in providing us with those models. It's challenging for me to say how would I change their models without seeing their models.\nBut what I think as an industry we agree on is that the models themselves are done from a very holistic perspective, and something as simple as the way that expenses are allocated. Right. It's not just, I wouldn't look at it just from the perspective. Okay. What you're doing differently from a trading perspective, Glenn, but it's really about the architecture of both the sense of what you think of the GMS stress, and then how you think of it over nine quarters afterwards. So there's many layers to your question where I think yes, in a period of stress you can have different environments, but there's a blanket envelope that the Fed is giving us that I think needs to be really looked at more in detail and more rigor in what's actually done from an industry perspective or an underlying company perspective.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nBut you're right, Glenn, we've gained share while still observing everything Sharon just described, and buffers on top of that. So it's a lot of work for folks on the ground because of course part of the Morgan Stanley durability story is one where we have excess capital, financial strength, and liquidity. So that has been the headline in boldface letters, and folks in every business are well aware of that and the risk-adjusted capital that needs to be applied across businesses and across clients. And nonetheless folks have gained share. So for me and for Sharon, for the team, what is important here is this idea of durably gaining shares.\nGiven the high cost of running these businesses, you should be able to achieve operating leverage when the environments are strong and when the environments are choppier, that you at least can make your cost of capital. That should be the bid ask, and that is the way we're continuing to think about the markets business and now doing so with excess capital, you know, by any measure.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you for all that. I have a much more answerable question for a follow up, and it relates to just lending in general. Like, what did you take the reserve on? I know it's small. Is that as of 31 March or is that as of kind of now and then? What did you sell to realize gain and other revenue? Just curious on those moving parts.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure.\nJust from the provisions perspective, it's as of 31 March, where basically for us, when you're looking at the metric, the quantitative metric that's most important from us from a CECL perspective is GDP. We do disclose that at the end of Q4, we had GDP of 1.9 as the expectation for the end of 2025, and that moved down to 1.5. So that's included in terms of what we've taken. Obviously, should there be changes, there will be changes. As you move forward from a provisions perspective in Q2, you then asked about other and how you think about the movement in those held for sale names. Obviously, we do have a number of names. We run a portfolio business, and we were focused very much on velocity. We've talked a lot about window driven environments. We had a window driven environment in.\nPeriods of Q1.\nWe were able to move and take advantage of things for syndication, and what we did is we basically cleared a lot of our chunkier positions, and you'll see that flow through that other line item.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhat that means of course is that we, all things being equal, have now capacity in the event book.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nHi Ted.\nQuick question.\nYou guys obviously have your fingers on the pulse of the markets very well, and there's been some discussions around in the fixed income trading area with Treasuries, this so-called basis trade, that there's some stresses out there. Do you guys have any sense of stress or are there any stresses going on in the market today, and where are you keeping extra attention in case the stresses do pop up?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell.\nThere were higher volumes earlier in the week, and we saw some derisking. That was followed by some strong auctions as of this morning anyway, when we were getting on this call. Markets continue to function, and like all markets, we're engaged with clients, but clearly we're moving from.\nOne instrument to another and we're going to be keeping an eye on that. But for our own part with respect to engagement with clients, it's been orderly, and again the strong auctions speak to that and we're going to keep a close eye out. But for us.\nIt's been orderly and clients have engaged.\nIn a way that has not created any sense of something broader. But.\nThat will continue to play out. But for us.\nIt's been regular way, some de-risking, higher volumes, but all things being equal, functioning markets.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nVery good. And Sharon, you obviously talked about the wealth management business in your prepared remarks, and you've got the Workplace channel as well as the self-directed, and the traditional Morgan Stanley full service channel. In these markets that we're in, where they're very volatile and choppy, are those three channels which is the one that you think will do best, and which is the one that might slow down in activity?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's a great question. What I can say so far is that based on what we've seen over the course of the last five years, right? It depends on the environment and what you're actually going through. We've seen clearly COVID was different when you think about self-directed. The Workplace channel is one where one could say you might see some of a decrease necessary in granting of stocks. That is what could happen. So if you want to take kind of that approach of where is the vulnerability, maybe that is one where the actual vesting or the grants of the various stocks might be there. You might not have IPO events. However, on the other side of that self-directed is one where we see record levels of activities in various days.\nWe've seen increased client engagement in self-directed and we've also really seen an increased client engagement on the advisor-led side. I highlighted what's known as unsolicited trades. So rather than an advisor necessarily calling an individual, we've seen those numbers really rise over the course of Q1. So that just shows you that there's a lot of engagement on both sides. The volumes from that advisor side over the last two weeks have been up 50% to 100 larger than over the volumes for the last 30 trading days. Remember all the stuff we used to talk about with next best action, et cetera, where advisors were sending next best actions to their individual retail clients? We've seen many more responses to that than we have historically over the course of these last two weeks.\nWhat to me that highlights is really the value of the advice and the questions. And then from a self-directed side, the fact that our technology has been able to handle this level of volumes without interruption allows a client who's self-directed to come back, continue to come back to the platform itself. So that's why I highlight those two channels, Workplace, a little bit less in our control. So I cannot exactly tell you what a Workplace channel would do in terms of granting new stock, et cetera.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning Devin.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nDirector of Financial Technology Research, Citizens JMP",
    "content2": "Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon. A question on expenses would be great to just get a bit of background on the recent initiative that drove some of the severance in the quarter. I know not a huge number, but just what you accomplished there, and then just more broadly thoughts on opportunities to drive more efficiency at the firm in different revenue environments, and just whether this current uncertainty will slow any investments or drive any change in kind of the expense growth plans overall.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWe had a reduction of 3% of our headcount ex-FAs in Q1. As you know, that was coming out of a rigorous year-end performance review, assessment, and process. We have ongoing investments in automation, AI, and assessing where we want our people for the next 5 years, 10 years. But clearly the environment is such that we'll be reviewing the overall workforce regularly as we always do. And when there's some uncertainty, you have to be doing that. But to be clear.\nWe like where we are right now and where talent can fit into the firm. We continue to bring people on board in the places where we intend on growing. So the expense mentality is around rigor and discipline. It is not necessarily about less. It's about the right allocation of human capital.\nIn the context of where the world is going.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nDirector of Financial Technology Research, Citizens JMP\n\nGot it. Thanks, Ted. And then just on the investment banking conversation, great to hear about the pipelines. Uncertainty has been a challenge. The other thing though, valuations are down a lot, right? The S&P is down mid-teens. A lot of these growth stocks are down 30%, 40%. So I'm just curious, for the new issue market or the M&A market to really turn back on, do you think we need to see kind of a V recovery in asset prices because that's where people's expectations are anchored, or do you think this is just much more about just some stability and people are going to try to execute on things? Once we get that, it's not just about valuations bouncing back to where we.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nStability will be more important than valuation. Most of these transactions are of comparative value, and so waiting for stocks to hit all-time highs again, that probably is not the right strategy. It's a question of what your longer-term priorities are with respect to things that matter to you. In the C-suite around supply chain, energy, technology, and sizing against the sector. So too with the IPO calendar, there were folks that came right as that window briefly shut. The window ought to reopen and potentially reopen for periods of time. That will allow for a lot of the new Pareto companies to come through. So I think it's more a sense of the uncertainty getting sort of getting.\nBarriered and having a sense that it's not totally risk off versus pure valuation. Which is why I'm saying pause versus delete.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, Ted. Pause, not delete. That's my key question.\nYou know, you sounded more upbeat than I'd say the average manager. I'm just trying to, what, maybe what you're seeing or what you've seen historically or what gives you a little bit more optimism than some others. On the Q4 call, you know, you said mergers backlog the best in seven years. You said the DCM is kind of a domino effect, activity in the CFO level, and sponsors are going to harvest, and the pipelines are still the same you said today, so I guess you could still paint a positive story. But I think the real question is, first of all, if that's accurate. I'm still reflecting your views, but at some point it's.\nThe question is, is that one month, two months? If we're in the next earnings call, we're still discussing what's going to happen with tariffs. Is it kind of, you know, do you have to think about right-sizing, and do we think about maybe this capital markets recovery, especially merger recovery, maybe not happening? At what point does the uncertainty go on for so long as to kill off the recovery?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat is the question. That is the question.\nThe raison d'être of.\nThe deals that are in the pipeline is a strong one because folks were interrupted obviously by the years of the pandemic and the uncertainty around interest rates. Now, of course, there is this. The question, Mike, is, you know, what are we talking about with respect to the macro environment? Are we talking about the rearchitecting of industrial policy in the context of America's place today and where it wants to be decades from now? Is it about getting our fiscal house in order?\nAnd how that interplays with tax and deregulation to come? So broader context, we're talking about writing our own imbalances and then redefining what's in America's long-term national interest. Those are weighty issues, complex, that is, intricate, complicated, that is unclear. So to your point, it could be that when one thinks about.\nHow big that adjustment is, that it will require enough time that the pause effectively becomes a relook, and the books get put away. But I think it's still relatively early in how this.\nNew framework.\nHas been formulated. We are finding, Mike, that we are still very much engaged with clients. Yes, we're asking more questions as they are. We're listening to a wider spectrum of possibilities. Yes, it's fair to say we're going to have higher structural volatility for a while. So what is the client strategy? What are the risks and what are their alternatives? What are the tactical options? You know, when you think about what we deliver, which is trusted advice, access to markets, a global perspective. It is the case that markets can be accessed over weekends, overnight, and can be done through semi-public, semi-private markets. There is an entire democratization or financialization of investors, buyers and sellers that allow for deals to happen in all but markets that have been shut down.\nSo it is the case truly that three or four months from now, if the markets have gotten even more complicated around these weighty issues, that the adjustment period looks like it will be a longer one, that it's more of a deal someday kind of thing. But I am of the view that we are still on pause. We don't know whether the economy is going to contract. We don't know what the rate of inflation will be when the transmission effects come through. You saw that today's PPI was in fact a miss on the negative side. So we are staying super close to clients, corporate and financial sponsors, and in our markets business, and then in our wealth business, high levels of interaction, activity such that we believe that the pause will be frustrating at times, as it is for all of us, Mike.\nThat deals take longer to print. But in the context of clarity around the other two pillars, too, tax and dereg, it may be that that is enough for our client base, especially at the top of the advice pyramid, to say, you know what, I can actually quantify what that higher structural volatility is about, whether it's in equity prices or in foreign exchange or in interest rates. And indeed, we will go forward. And the answer to your question, and it is an important one for a firm like this, is one that will be one that I think we'll have more clarity on.\nWhen we see how the economy is reacting to all of the discussions and issues on the table that I've described.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right, thank you for that answer.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

Please continue to stand by as we will be going live shortly. Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer: this call is being recorded.\nDuring today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release, Financial Supplement, and Strategic Update, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.\nPlease refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the Earnings Release and Strategic Update. Within the Strategic Update, certain reported information has been adjusted. As noted, these adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance.\nThe reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the Earnings Release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. First, we would like to acknowledge our colleagues, clients, shareholders, friends, and family in Los Angeles. Our hearts go out to all those impacted and dealing with the horrific devastation from the wildfires. We're grateful to all the firefighters and first responders. We are thinking of you.\nOver the last several years we've been faced with two central themes. One, the end of financial repression, namely the passing of the era of ultra low interest rates and the reemergence of inflation, and two the end of the end of history with the resumption of geopolitical uncertainty.\nThese paradigm shifts, juxtaposed against renewed investor and corporate confidence, present opportunities to support clients with exceptional advice and market access. Morgan Stanley is well positioned to execute against these opportunities. The firm's consistent execution is demonstrated by the cadence of top line and bottom line in 2024.\nRevenues across the four quarters of $15.1 billion, $15.0 billion, $15.4 billion, and $16.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.02, $1.82, $1.88 and $2.22. The fourth quarter was a top line record with the highest earnings per share in over 15 years, capping off one of Morgan Stanley's strongest years. For the full year, the firm delivered a return on tangible of 19% and earnings per share of $7.95, making significant progress toward our long-term goals.\nThe results reflect consistent, durable earnings across the firm, evidencing that Morgan Stanley can deliver during this period of continued macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty as we do every January. Let's begin with our 2025 strategic update entitled Four Pillars of Morgan Stanley: The Integrated Firm. The slides can be found on our website.\nOn slide three, we introduce the four pillars of Morgan Stanley that support our integrated firm, strategy, culture, financial strength, and growth. Strategy is about consistently serving our clients and raising, managing, and allocating capital. Culture is about rigor, humility, and partnership.\nFinancial strength is about strong capital and liquidity alongside durable earnings, and growth is about smart strategic investments across the firm, which generate new opportunities to capture client share. The investment thesis for Morgan Stanley rests on our ability to deliver the integrated firm supported by these four pillars. Slide four.\nFirst, to reiterate Morgan Stanley's clear strategy to raise, manage, and allocate capital for corporations, individuals, asset managers, and asset owners around the world. In the past year, our engagement advice across the full range of institutional and individual clients drove results. Slide five. Morgan Stanley culture is defined by rigorous humility and partnership.\nThe leadership group on the operating and management committees have an average tenure at the firm of more than 20 years, many of them across business segments and regions. More broadly, our leadership body of 2,312 Managing Directors, 173 of whom we recently promoted to the partnership, have been with Morgan Stanley for an average of 15 years. 30% of our Managing Directors have been at the firm for two decades.\nOur partnership is defined by Morgan Stanley leaders who embody this homegrown culture, joined by acquisition and lateral talent who bring an incremental skill set to the platform. Morgan Stanley's culture of first-class business in a first-class way forged over many years of trial and success is a competitive advantage and will contribute to the success of the integrated firm.\nSlide six highlights our position of financial strength, the third pillar of the integrated firm, and is the output of a clearly defined strategy and a tightly knit culture. Our consistently strong capital position over recent years is a standout. In 2024 we accreted over $5.5 billion of CET1 while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.\nWe will continue to prudently grow the dividend, continue to invest in each of our three businesses and across our infrastructure, and continue to opportunistically repurchase the stock. In 2024, we effectively deployed capital to support clients and translated that into earnings growth. High capital levels protect us in challenging climates and sustain us for long-term growth. Slide seven brings us to the fourth pillar of the strategy, revenue and earnings growth.\nEarnings expansion in 2024 reflects a return on multi-year investment to support clients. We will continue to invest heavily across the firm in our talent, our clients, in E*TRADE, and in Parametric, in our bank, across resiliency in technology and infrastructure, and in the development of the integrated firm. In the past year, expense growth was tempered by our focus on rolling off initial integration spend and taking opportunities to consolidate our real estate footprint.\nInvestments for growth will continue to be supported by ongoing disciplined prioritization of our expense base. Slide eight, the last six years show a step function change in the firm's growth across our businesses. In the Wealth and Investment Management segments, combined revenues have grown from $20 billion to $34 billion, and total client assets have nearly tripled to $7.9 trillion.\nThis growth has been achieved both by way of acquisition and through organic execution. You will also note that Institutional Securities wallet share has grown by nearly 100 basis points. These results reflect not only constructive markets, but also a sharpened focus on key client relationships and an expanded coverage of corporates and asset managers. Morgan Stanley scale positions us over the long term to deliver growth in each of our three business segments.\nWe win both through an expanding denominator of global securities banking wealth and Investment Management activity, and by increasing our numerator, as in our wallet share, in each segment. In short, we seek to gain durable share in the secular growth businesses in which we participate. Slide nine goes a level deeper into Institutional Securities. First, the growth in Institutional Securities has been both broad-based and crucially is global.\nIt is important that we are relevant in all the major regions around the world. Amidst geopolitical and interest rate uncertainty, each region grew revenues by roughly 20% in 2024. These results follow multiple years of investment in talent and leadership, as well as efficient and disciplined RWA growth. In 2024 we saw Institutional Securities deliver an operating margin of 31% and revenue growth that was significantly higher than our RWA growth.\nWe are in a leadership position and can offer trusted advice and market access into the investment banking new issue and M&A cycle which just lies ahead. Slide 10 in Wealth Management. Investments in our self-directed and Workplace channels drive our differentiated client acquisition funnel.\nToday, with our expanded offering, we reach over 19 million relationships and have added net new assets of over $250 billion in each of the past two years, on track to delivering $10 trillion+ of total client assets. An important indicator of Wealth Management momentum is fee-based flows, which reached an exceptional $123 billion in 2024.\nDelivering on new relationships and net new asset growth creates opportunities for our team of world-class financial advisors to tap into the integrated firm for their clients. Slide 11 highlights the breadth and tenure of Wealth Management's client relationships. As 60% of advisor-led assets are associated with clients who have an average duration of 20 years, we retain 99% of our clients, reflecting their enduring trust in Morgan Stanley.\nThe slide illustrates our multichannel model, which continues to drive new assets to the platform. 30% of our advisor-led assets are associated with clients who have a Morgan Stanley relationship of less than 10 years, and 10% of advisor-led assets are with clients of less than two years. The client acquisition funnel supports durable growth, namely, as clients mature with our financial advisors, they become the foundation for the continued growth of recurring fee-based revenues.\nSlide 12, in Investment Management, we continue to focus on the secular growth areas of customization and alternatives. Our industry-leading Parametric platform, inclusive of overlay, has grown to $575 billion in alternatives. Our investable assets have more than doubled in size to $240 billion. Investments in these secular growth areas have brought more balance to our Investment Management business and supported fee-based revenues.\nAdditionally, the integrated firm, particularly the relationship with Wealth Management, continues to benefit the Investment Management platform with the enhancement of retail-oriented distribution offerings and additional product capabilities. Slide 13. An area of investment is in the incremental growth of our US banks since 2018.\nThe firm has significantly grown deposit balances and continues to source deposits from Wealth Management clients with an expanded product offering. On the asset side, we will continue to grow our Wealth Management lending capability by covering clients holistically as their financial needs evolve. In addition, we will continue to utilize the bank platform to support growth in eligible institutional businesses.\nAs we continue to grow our capabilities across the integrated firm, we are well positioned to provide a full suite of solutions to our clients. Slide 14. A dividend that is aligned to the growth of fee-based earnings has been a leading priority. Our durable results demonstrate consistent execution of our strategy, and we have raised our quarterly dividend by $0.075 for three years in a row to $0.925 per share.\nSlide 15, as you have heard us discussed during the past year, and the integrated firm brings together our world-class wealth and Investment Management franchises with our world-class Institutional Securities franchise. We are consistently strengthening the pillars underlying the integrated firm to deliver on our strategic goals.\nAcross the integrated firm, Morgan Stanley is relevant to our clients spanning from the advice dispensed in corporate boardrooms to our financial wellness programs for that company's employees. We're also the premier holistic partner to asset managers, partnering with them to grow their businesses and to generate alpha.\nWe can deliver institutional capabilities to our clients alongside sophisticated Wealth Management advice and distribution in an integrated service model, and in so doing be mindful of potential conflicts. To open 2025, we have formalized the integrated firm by positioning leadership talent at the center of client coverage, integrated data risk management, and infrastructure to drive growth as we serve more clients across their full suite of needs.\nThis effort will be led by Mandell Crawley, a three-decade Morgan Stanley executive and a member of our operating committee, together with Co-Presidents Dan Simkowitz and Andy Saperstein, and the integrated firm organization is aligned to scale client opportunities across Morgan Stanley. Slide 16, the Morgan Stanley investment thesis is robust. In 2024 we delivered top line and bottom-line strength and consistency.\nThe full year results are strong relative to our long-term firm-wide goals. We ended 2024 with total client assets and at $7.9 trillion, Wealth Management pre-tax margins of 27%, a firm efficiency ratio of 71%, and a return on tangible of 19%. Of note, we added a new goal to achieve durable wallet share gains in Institutional Securities.\nThe additional metric for Institutional Securities is an appropriate reflection of the expected contribution of this business segment to the firm's growth narrative. The key word is durable. There will always be market and business cycles in each of these businesses. Morgan Stanley's trusted relationships over the very long-term lead to superior results against the four pillars of strategy, culture, financial strength, and growth.\nDelivering the integrated firm is foundational to durable earnings growth and 20% returns through the cycle. Thank you. Now Sharon will review our fourth quarter and annual results. Then together we will take your questions.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $61.8 billion in 2024 and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of $16.2 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 18.8% and EPS was $7.95. For the fourth quarter, ROTCE was 20.2% and EPS was $2.22. The full year efficiency ratio was 71.1%.\nImproved efficiency not only demonstrates our ability to grow revenues but also to prioritize our controllable spend; occupancy and equipment costs held flat, benefiting from the prior year's consolidation of our real estate footprint. During 2024, we took real estate charges of $62 million, which impacted full year EPS by $0.03. Professional services declined year-over-year, aided by the roll off of integration related expenses and discipline across project spend.\nThese savings helped self fund investments across infrastructure to support growth, such as expanding data centers, capacity, renovations, and technology modernization efforts. Self-funding investments remains a priority in the short run. Similarly sized additional modernization efforts focused on decommissioning legacy technologies may result in higher amortization costs.\nThis, alongside business-enabled innovation and process optimization with AI, should support the firm's future efficiency path. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered very strong annual results across businesses and regions, demonstrating the high quality, breadth, and depth of our world-class global franchise.\nFull-year revenues of $28.1 billion included our highest reported equity revenues and the highest results across combined equity and fixed income markets. The strong annual performance showcases our global footprint and our ability to capture client share amidst an increasingly constructive backdrop.\nQ4 revenues were $7.3 billion as markets remained active, bucking the typical seasonal slowdown. We supported clients throughout the quarter and ended the year with momentum. Investment banking revenues were $6.2 billion for the full year, reflecting growth across regions and products. 2024 commenced with strong debt underwriting activity, followed by M&A announcements that picked up in the second half and ended with increased equity underwriting activity as the IPO market posted its highest volumes since 2021.\nFourth quarter investment banking revenues were $1.6 billion. Results were largely driven by accelerating strength in equity underwriting as follow-on and IPO issuance saw meaningful improvements year-over-year over the comparison period. We also saw corporates and sponsors take advantage of constructive markets in the quarter. Advisory revenues improved year-over-year on higher completed M&A transactions.\nLooking ahead to 2025, our M&A pipelines are healthy and diversified, outpacing recent years. Financial sponsors are joining corporates to drive activity evaluating exit opportunities for long-held assets. CEO and boardroom confidence continues to improve as valuations stabilize and financing markets remain strong. Our business is well positioned for strong continued rebound in dealmaking activity.\nTurning to equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business, evidenced by record full year revenues of $12.2 billion. These results reflect year-over-year growth across regions, with record performance out of Asia, demonstrating the importance of having a global footprint. Full year results were supported by increased prime brokerage balances and our agility as we navigated the market well.\nRevenues were $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Following the US elections, clients re-risked quickly given shifting market dynamics. Additionally, third quarter strength in Asia carried into the fourth quarter, with renewed investor interest across the region. Prime brokerage revenues were a record for the business, as clients remained engaged and balances rose to peak levels.\nCash results increased year-over-year, consistent with higher levels of client engagement and volumes. Derivative results increased versus last year's fourth quarter on the back of higher activity across a variety of products, in line with improved risk appetite from clients.\nFixed income revenues were $8.4 billion for the full year driven by consistent quarterly performance across the businesses. The full year results demonstrate our multi year efforts to recenter our fixed income business around the integrated firm. Improved trading performance, growth in durable lending revenues, and servicing corporate and sponsor relationships all contributed to results.\nQuarterly revenues were $1.9 billion driven by credit products and commodities. Micro revenues were above historical quarterly averages. Results were driven by securitized products, which benefited from higher loan balances and an increase in securitization activity. Macro performance was relatively flat versus the prior fourth quarter. Commodity revenues improved year-over-year.\nResults were led by our North America power and gas business, where structured opportunities for corporate clients leveraged the integrated firm. Turning to ISG lending and provisions for the full year, ISG provisions were $202 million and $78 million for the quarter. The quarterly provision was driven by portfolio growth and a build in a handful of individual assessments. For the full year, ISG net charge-offs were $210 million for the quarter.\nNet charge-offs were $62 million primarily related to several commercial real estate loans, which were largely provisioned for in prior quarters. Turning to Wealth Management, 2024 was a strong year for Wealth Management. Full year highlights include record revenues of $28.4 billion, pre-tax profit of $7.7 billion, and a reported margin of 27.2%. The strength of our scaled and differentiated client acquisition funnel continues to set us apart.\nFee-based flows were $123 billion, exceeding $100 billion for the fourth consecutive year. Clients continue to seek Morgan Stanley's advice, supporting our thesis that as assets move through the funnel, incremental revenue growth and margin expansion will follow. For the fourth quarter, revenues were $7.5 billion, and the reported PBT margin was 27.5%. DCP and real estate related charges negatively impacted the quarterly margin by approximately 140 basis points.\nAsset management revenues in the quarter set a new record of $4.4 billion, showcasing the progress we have made to durable fee-based revenues with each quarter. This year, asset management revenues saw sequential improvement, powered by constructive markets and consistently strong fee-based flows. Fourth quarter fee-based flows were $35 billion.\nImportantly, over the last two years, we have seen an increase in the number and the pace of assets migrating from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. We remain an industry leader in organic growth. Net new assets for the quarter were $57 billion. Full year NNA of $252 billion represents approximately 5% annual growth of beginning period assets. This year, our advisor-led channel drove the results, benefiting from both existing clients and new clients coming to the firm.\nTransactional revenues for the quarter were $1 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues represent the highest level of activity we have seen since the peak in 2021. Higher retail engagement in equity-related products and demand for alternative products supported results. These revenues will continue to benefit from the breadth and the depth of our growing alternatives platform.\nBank lending balances were $160 billion. Loan growth of $4 billion was driven by securities-based lending, where we saw demand for new lines and a decline in the pace of paydown. Total deposits increased 3% sequentially to $370 billion, driven by higher sweep balances.\nEnd of period sweep deposits have increased for two consecutive quarters, supporting the view that as rate dynamics change, and markets turn to be more constructive, sweep balances will be increasingly transactional in nature. While clients deployed more sweep cash into rising markets, particularly in December, balances held strong as clients showed less rate sensitivity with their transactional cash.\nNet interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher sweeps. Looking ahead into 2025, the combination of a more stable deposit mix, higher lending balances, and the rate outlook suggest that first quarter NII should not fluctuate materially from our fourth quarter results. We are intently focused on driving additional growth across channels in our advisor-led channel.\nOur effectiveness in deepening relationships is evidenced by our consistently strong fee-based flows in Workplace. Our recently announced partnership with Carta puts us at the center of new client stock plan opportunities as private companies consider going public, and in self-directed. The number of active traders on the E*TRADE platform grew, ending the year at levels higher than 2022.\nMoving to Investment Management, the business reported annual revenues of $5.9 billion and quarterly revenues of $1.6 billion. Our AUM reached a new peak at year-end of $1.7 trillion, supported by market gains and net inflows. Long term net inflows were $4.3 billion in the quarter, driven by continued demand for our fixed income strategies and Parametric customized portfolios. This brings 2024 long term net inflows to $18 billion.\nWithin alternatives and solutions, Parametric remains a key differentiator for MSIM. Growth of the brand will be supported by investments in technology, ongoing education for retail clients on the benefits of customization, and tailored solutions for asset managers. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $67 billion on the back of strong fund performance and seasonality, some of which may reverse in the first quarter.\nFourth quarter asset management and related fees of $1.6 billion increased 11% versus the prior year, driven by higher average AUM. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase sequentially.\nQuarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $88 million. Gains were concentrated in infrastructure, US private equity, and private credit. In parallel with Wealth Management, MSIM is helping to deliver our asset-led strategy. Our efforts to build a business that is well diversified and focused on secular growth areas, as well as global opportunities, gives us confidence to drive incremental growth.\nTurning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Over the course of 2024, we demonstrated velocity of resources. Standardized RWAs declined sequentially to $473 billion, driven by year-end seasonality and market dynamics. Lower RWAs at period end have already begun to reverse as we enter a new calendar year.\nDuring the year we accreted over $5.5 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and our standardized CET1 ratio ended the year at 15.9%. For the full year, we bought back $3.3 billion of common stock. Our tax rate was 23.1% for the full year, and the quarterly tax rate was 24.1%. Reflecting the level and the mix of earnings, we expect our 2025 tax rate to be approximately 24%, and consistent with prior years. We expect some quarterly volatility.\nAs we look ahead into 2025, our franchise is well positioned for growth, exiting the year with momentum across all of our businesses. With a strong capital position to invest in our clients and our businesses, we enter the year with record asset levels, healthy and diversified pipelines, an engaged and institutional retail client base, and a strong global brand. We are focused on disciplined execution as we progress towards our goals. With that, we will now open the lineup to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are now ready to take in questions. To get in the queue, you may press star and the number one on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star and the number two on your touchtone telephone.\nYou are allowed to ask one question and one follow-up, and then we'll move to the next person in the queue. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nHey, thanks.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Glenn. How are you doing? Glenn, how are you?\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nAll right, appreciate it. Where to begin? I guess let's talk about trading. There's a lot of upside in trading. We've all seen great trading environments, and this certainly was a good one. I wonder if you could just try to parse out, you know, what, how you think about great trading environment versus what your words are just more durable.\nYou know, the higher client balances, the record PB, the share gains, and how are you going to measure. The success of those durable gains? You know, I'm just trying to separate your actions versus the environment. You certainly have been performing really well. Thanks.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nAppreciate that. The focus on institutional securities over the last number of years is of course to deliver to key clients the whole product set across what, as you know, we called at one point about five, six years ago, I think it was in 2018, the integrated investment bank.\nThat was the bringing together of folks in equities, fixed income, capital markets, and investment banking, minding obviously all the walls between them, but having folks mobilize across those divisions, across the regions, and really understand what life is like to sit in the shoes of folks in different divisions. As you know, in this business you don't actually know what that feels like unless you're in that business.\nWe have leaders moving around, and six years later now with ISG under Dan Simkowitz's. Leadership, we're able to in an environment that is friendly to a lot of the businesses because now we have real corporate finance activity, we have real interest rates, and you have effectively two-way markets in lots of places around the world with respect to central bank activity, with respect to buyers and sellers of assets.\nOf course, if you're well organized, you can prosecute that in an orthodoxical way. We have, during this period under leadership of Sharon in the office of CFO, been quite prudent on the deployment of those risk-weighted assets through our Chief Risk Officer, Charles Smith. How do those risk-weighted assets and GAAP balance sheet get deployed to clients?\nYou know, one mistake, Glenn, is you can lose the forest for the trees and not think about all the client touch points across the integrated firm we're calling it, or you can actually lose sight of the real drivers of what makes that client valuable to the institution. Now we've had six, seven years of really focusing on that and preparing ourselves for the ability to expand our wallet at a time where we believe the denominator is growing as well.\nIt's a little trickier to try to expand the numerator, your wallet, when the denominator is not moving, as was the case with zero interest rates, because you are effectively not a price maker, and you are potentially going to be taking some concentrated risk. Here, now, with the cycle having transitioned, we were able to lean in.\nFirst, across our sweet spot, which is equities, to have not just prime brokerage, but the cash equities and derivatives businesses really start to generate above cost of capital ROEs. The entire basket of equities offering to our clients.\nIn fixed income, which has been extraordinarily stable in what is intrinsically an unstable business given the very different businesses of commodities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and credit and the leadership there, Hallik and Horder have done a brilliant job really running a durable business with a lot of annuitized revenue around a well-considered financing, structuring, lending businesses that look quite like the businesses we have in classic underwriting.\nSuch that when we now go into this investment banking cycle where we do think there is going to be an acceleration of classic primary and secondary offerings. We are already doing business that looks like that inside of sales and trading. Lending businesses, client advice, and of course there's real collegiality across the investment bank.\nThe last piece to this is what we've been waiting for, which are M&A tickets, which, as you know, are the top of the waterfall, the highest margin product that then have multiplier effect through the whole organization. That has begun. The pipeline is very strong, depending on how you measure it, the strongest it's been in five to 10 years, maybe even longer. We are excited about pushing that through to the rest of the investment bank.\nWhat I have said, I would repeat here too just to give a lengthy answer, Glenn, is that on ISG wallet share, you know, we are clear that we want those share gains to be durable, which is why we didn't go with quantification. We want those gains to be ones that are not gains by reaching concentration risk, counterparty risk. The clients know we are serious about bringing ISG to the fore.\nThat the integrated firm now is bringing together, these world-class wealth and investment management businesses with our investment bank. The proof is in the pudding this past year, 100 basis point gain plus or minus in the investment bank to roughly 15% wallet in a growing denominator. As you can tell, given we've been quite disciplined on RWA growth against that and you see the operating leverage in the income statement, it's fair to say the institution at large is very excited.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThat was a very full answer. I really appreciate it. I'll cede my follow-up to the group. Thanks.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks Glenn.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Ebrahim.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. I guess maybe just, I know you addressed this in prior calls, but as we think about just investments in systems as it pertains to AML BSA on the Wealth Management side, if you don't mind addressing where the firm stands there today, you, in terms of sort of meeting all the highest standards from a regulatory compliance standpoint.\nI think the essence of my question is, as we think about the growth opportunity in terms of international wealth, do you need to sort of get your ducks lined up on the AML BSA front in order to pursue those more aggressively or actively? Thanks.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you for the question. I think that the way I would answer your question is more fulsome than just specifically looking at one particular sector. The point that I would underscore is the results themselves in this business speak for themselves in terms of the investment, the ability to attract clients, both existing assets, as well as new clients across the Wealth Management platform. That's the first point that I would make. The second point that I would make is that over the course of.\nNot just the last year but really multiple years, we've been investing in all of our processes and our systems in order to engage and make sure that we have a robust infrastructure in order to be allowed to grow broadly and meet all of our growth objectives. That has to do with everything that I mentioned across the technology side, across better understanding our data, better servicing our clients in terms of investment dollars, and in terms of the underlying infrastructure.\nWhat we're trying to do and what we've been actively pursuing is making sure that across the firm, not just specific to wealth, we can service and look and impact all of our clients. Moreover, you can see that very well in terms of our ability to actually continue to attract assets. We'll be making all of the necessary investments to continue to be world class, both across people and our technology.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you. I guess, separate question, slide 13 with regards to the investment into the bank. Just remind us in terms of where we stand in terms of the integration of the bank, and as we think about, with some of your peers, where the bank and the wealth businesses probably are fully integrated. Are we there yet? What's the opportunity when you think about just deposit growth from your Wealth Management clients that you can bring on board?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWe're definitely not there yet. We still have a lot to do. When we think about the bank, I've always, both internally and for many externally, felt that the bank itself is an incredible growth engine across the institution. If you look at our bank, we obviously started our bank much later than many of the peers that we now compete with. From a commercial bank perspective, we have a very different deposit mix than others.\nWhat's so interesting about our deposit mix is that over 70% of our deposits come from our Wealth Management clients. Now, that's currently, as you know, largely coming from sweeps and from savings accounts. There's much more that we can do when we think about the deposit franchise itself, and then we can talk a little bit also about the other side of the balance sheet.\nWe're investing in those deposit opportunities. Remember, we didn't really have bank rails until we bought E*TRADE. That was part of the value proposition of acquiring E*TRADE and working with those bank rails to offer real checking accounts, and continue to have a savings account offering.\nMoreover, as you think about the work we're doing to invest the banking products within Workplace Solutions, you now have different ways to manage cash and cash alternatives for the actual underlying employees, as Ted talked about from an integrated firm perspective. There's much more that we can do with servicing and growing that deposit base over time.\nAs you think about the lending side and you think about where we are, we continue to see opportunities to help our wealth clients as they expand their lending needs and we better understand their portfolios. Moreover, just holistically, as Ted mentions in the slide, there are places where we are still working to move eligible ISG assets onto the bank.\nThat should help institutional securities as you think about the actual funding profile associated with those assets. There are many places that, when you look overall at the integrated firm, the bank plays an important role in making sure we have the ability to see that grow.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, Ebrahim, I'll tag onto that deposit side. We're going to service clients across all three channels in wealth. The FA channel, the everyday transaction offering, Cash Plus type of offering in E*TRADE. We're going to continue to focus on checking accounts with competitive rates, integrating products into the client journey as they move along with E*TRADE to potentially a classic FA.\nYou know, we've been really banging the drum on Workplace, where we can partner with companies to reach employees. On the loan side, as Sharon said, we've been growing loans steadily. The loans number in wealth, as you know, was about $80 billion in Q4 2018. That's doubled to $160 billion. We grew that every quarter in 2024. You know, we're a bank, we lend, and we have to do that in the context of deepening relationships.\nWe lend to about 16% of our households, and the best-in-class peers are higher. They're, you know, they're 50% higher, mid-20s. There's, as Sharon has said, real opportunity. In ISG, we've been growing the lending capability there too, up about 15% year-over-year.\nThere's real focus on this and upside. I think back to the concept of owning Morgan Stanley as a durable instrument that. We are growing both deposits and loans in a smart way over the next five to 10 years. You can expect these numbers to continue to move higher.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning, Brennan. Good morning.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, Ted. Good morning. How are you? We'd love to follow up on some of that last discussion and talk about the loan growth because it seems like loan growth was, the trends were better than certainly many were expecting last year. It feels like given the expectation for capital markets reopening, improving risk appetites, we should continue to see that building momentum.\nCould you talk a little bit below the surface around what you're seeing on the loan side? You spoke to it at a really high level before, but I'd just love to drill down and hear what you're seeing more recently. Where do you stand from a capability perspective? Do you guys need to continue to build that out or do you feel like you're fully ramped from a competitive perspective?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Brennan. I'll take that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as you alluded to what we saw, if you'll remember, over the last, since really interest rates, when they began to rise, we saw a decline in the use of the SBL product, and we often actually saw an increase in pay downs. What's changed over the last, particularly we noted it this quarter, is we've seen that pace of pay downs decline, and then we've actually seen an increased use of the lines.\nThe important part there is, as you know, probably better than anyone else, is that that product is one that is often generally used in periods of time by our clients when you actually see markets rise. I wouldn't be surprised if we also begin to see it from a tax perspective as we enter the second part of the quarter. In terms of capabilities. Excuse me, in terms of capabilities, I think we have the capabilities. There's clearly places you can still look from a tailored perspective.\nThere's still capabilities when you think about the assets that we can move from an eligible perspective from the ISG side onto the bank. It's a different portion of the question in terms of what we're doing from a legal entity perspective. Overall, I think we're very happy with what we have from the Wealth Management perspective. It's really about seeing the change in environment that should help the dynamics as we move forward to see that increase in loan growth.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI think integrated firm matters here because there is the ability for us now in our risk committee sessions to look at tailored lending as a form of sophisticated structured product that has some institutional qualities to it. It's not so much the classic bifurcation of division-by-division, but more of a firm lens across what the commitments are at a time when we should see acceleration in both of the major sides of the house.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThat's interesting when thinking about utilizing the balance sheet. Thanks for that. I'm really sort of happy to ask this next question because of the focus on cash in the past year or so. Now I don't have to worry about drawing Sharon's ire when I ask about this one. It seems like we're likely to have a pivot around cash trends. We've got stability, and even a little growth in the sweep. When you think about prior easing cycles.\nHow long has it taken before we see some of the recycling out of those yield oriented cash equivalents like CDs and money funds, which tend to be thinner margin, into more market-oriented products that are higher margin? How should we be thinking about that timeline? Thanks.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nBrennan. It might be the first time in two years that I'm excited to answer a sweeps question. I am really encouraged by the signs that we see on the underlying sweeps dynamic. It often actually plays to the fact that there is a lot that our clients can do, and a lot that our clients are interested in right now. You see that in the transactional level of activity, and all of the other underlying trends as it relates to sweeps are actually playing out in that increase in transactional.\nIf I can just break it down, what we see, we look at sweeps and we look at the underlying sweeps in multiple different layers. How do you think about where the sweeps are going to products that are under one year? How do you look at sweeps in terms of products over one year, in terms of fixed income? How do you look at sweeps going in and out of market?\nWhat you saw this particular quarter, which I found to be quite, quite encouraging and fascinating in terms of the sentiment of the retail investor actually changing, is that we saw a really strong increase of the flows moving from sweeps into market. It's not as though they aren't using that cash to invest, they're just using that cash to look at it more transactionally, to go into market and asset level products.\nThat's point number one. Point number two is you began to see the fixed income products that were over one year mature and just sit there. It's as though when you think about what is the retail client doing, they're waiting, they're getting those assets, they're letting it mature, and it's just sitting in some sort of sweep product until they want to deploy those assets into the market.\nThe final point is you're just seeing less activity go into various types of, quote, cash alternatives. In my mind, that just means that this cash, now that rates have come down, that markets are going up, it feels to be somewhat more normalized. It's acting transactional, which is what we had always assumed there would be some level of transactional cash.\nTo your point, as that rate differential goes down and it's no longer you can earn 5% from a cash product, there are places and decisions of what individuals want to do with that cash. They're letting it sit, and they're using it to eventually invest in markets. What you're seeing is that that is actually taking place in the transactional line item.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Well, last quarter, Ted, you were pretty pulled up on the markets, and some of that's playing out. How much are your backlogs up? Are backlogs a record? I'm not hearing record backlogs anymore. I hear up, but not record. I'm just wondering how much you can monetize the backlogs that were in place in some cases, I guess, you know, one, two, or three years ago.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, depending on how you measure it. Whether volume or unit, you know, number of units or sort of Ag value, you see pipelines in the M&A product that are the highest in seven years. That is really encouraging. Now, some of this will be dependent on how things roll out in the first couple of months of the incoming administration and how things feel on a cross-border basis.\nThe pent-up activity that we're seeing is starting to release. You saw some announcements going into the end of the year. You saw some very large capital raises that took place where enormous capacity was filled for great names over a weekend or over a 24-hour period. We haven't seen that since really 2020, and that was a totally different interest rate and backdrop context.\nThere is clearly demand, even discussions for IPO potential not just as an option versus selling to another sponsor or selling to a corporate, but in fact a real option. I am, you're right, I've been bullish on this. It has taken some time and I think we will have some unpredictability around regulation in one jurisdiction versus another.\nI think the demand for some corporates to get bigger, to purify their businesses given the deglobalization effect, given climate, given interest rate transition, they have things to do. Again, the sponsors, they are looking to harvest some of these assets given where prices are and that sort of mismatch of expectations versus the reality of what the market's willing to pay for good companies. I think that's really starting to come together.\nI would also say that within the investment banking cylinder, that is M&A versus ECM versus DCM, those sub lines, as you know, have rotated over the last four to six quarters. A couple quarters ago was a great ECM quarter. This past quarter was a DCM quarter. That also is healthy. It suggests that people in the treasury or CFO's office of large corporate clients are looking at all the toggles.\nIt is an activity-based business. I think 2025, as we move through the year, if we continue to have reasonably constructed markets, reasonably predictable interest rates, and a reasonable sort of geopolitical backdrop, we are going to see increasing activity as the year goes on.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYou said the best backlog in seven years, was that for mergers or all investment banking?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nLargely, largely, largely the M&A number, Mike. Globally.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, yeah, that's a. I guess that would be a lagging driver to the whole capital market theme. For you guys, when you think of a multiplier.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes, yes, by the way. Yes, yes, yes on that, Mike, exactly. As you've been saying all along, that is the last piece. You know, there have been periods where it's sort of frustrating. Stuff gets discussed at sort of free board approval level, and then there's some unpredictability and it gets tabled. The inventory around stuff that is idea flow, that is near announcement, that piece of it is increasing, and it may not result ultimately in a merger ticket.\nIt may actually turn into the company being carved out and taken public. I think what we are increasingly confident about, again, if the market and the economy hold up, and those are ifs, but if they do, then you're going to see the entire corporate finance cylinder really kick into something that maybe looks like mid-1990s activity. Classic corporate finance.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nOperator, can you hear us? We can move on to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nStephen, your line is now open. We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning, Steven.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, and good morning. Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon. Wanted to ask on the 30% Wealth Management margin target. Just taking a step back, you're already running at 29% on a core basis. Sharon, you cited a number of headwinds in the coming year, whether it's just NII, inflecting AUM growth, capital markets, fee tailwinds.\nI'm just trying to understand what would preclude you from getting to that goal this year, and why isn't the longer-term aspiration something north of 30% just given significant operating leverage in this model at scale?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "I'll take that, Steve. I just juxtapose this call to where we were a year ago, and a lot of the conversations, obviously, as you think about the change in the rate environment, but then also, very importantly, the change in the asset management fee revenues that has been a very large contributor to the point that you're making, where we've seen the fee-based increase, we've seen the AUM, and then we've seen the revenues.\nI don't want to lose sight of the fact that we're investing in this business, and that investment is very important. We've always said over the course of the last five years we can get to 30%. We don't want to starve the business. We want to do it in a durable manner, and we want to make sure that we are able to invest specifically in the places that might be margin dilutive. Those are Workplace, there are different parts of marketing, and investment in the sales cycle.\nAs you think about self-directed, putting money towards the top of the funnel, putting money towards technology that actually helps match places where you have the top of the funnel into the advisor-led channel, all of that's working. The last thing one would want to do is put a target out there, see a change in dynamics associated with all of a sudden markets going down, or there's some shock that we're unaware of, you're unable to meet those targets, and you pull back investments.\nThat's not how we want to run this. As Ted said in his prepared remarks, the word across this entire script is durable. We're looking for durable margins, we're looking for durable growth, we're looking for durable returns. All of that comes into play as we think about the actual investment in the business over time.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. What I would add to that is the extraordinary performance of, well, you just look at the fact that revenues grew by 8% year-over-year, but PBT grew by 19%. That's the kind of progress against larger numbers that we are excited to see, and a full contribution to the firm outcome.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great to hear. Just one quick follow up, Sharon, you referenced the recently announced partnership with Carta, and was hoping to double click into some of the tangible financial from leveraging that partnership. Just given the number of plan participants, it's been pretty stagnant over the last few quarters, but certainly feels as though this could be a potential accelerant, maybe help reinvigorate growth within that channel.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, let me just first, I'll take the second part of your question first because there is some stuff to unpack when you actually look at the underlying participants we have talked about, and we've seen we will see a transition from some of the stock sale plans that we have sold and announced both in Europe and in Asia that are associated with the actual participants.\nI just want to be clear that there are other underlying factors in there. The other point that I would mention is we have not been in a cycle in which, especially over the last two years, you've seen a lot of monetization events. You have changes really in the workforce dynamics for many of these companies where you might have seen headcount reductions, you might have seen acquisitions in which some of those stock plan participants decline.\nI don't want you to read into that as though there's not investment or it's not growing because we continue to meet WIN mandates, and we continue to have expanded corporate relationships. That's important as we talk about where are we investing. We are investing, and we're seeing progress as we continue to have greater breadth of corporates that we service within the United States, in particular now as it relates to Carta.\nI'm glad you mentioned and asked the question, as that's a really exciting partnership, especially as the capital market cycle turns. As you're likely aware, Carta does service the private companies in particular.\nWhat we have now done in the relationship that we announced at the end of last year is that we have an exclusive partnership with Carta, which means that they will refer those private different stock plans or different corporate companies to Morgan Stanley as they move into going public. It's really exciting for many reasons, not just the opportunities on the wealth side, but also as Ted talked a lot about, is the integrated firm.\nThere are a lot of places to build out those relationships as those companies are going through that transition. Moreover, what we are committed to doing as we go through that transition is to make sure that it's a seamless experience for those clients. As you know, we already do service individually. Some of those private companies as they move public, they'll have that seamless experience both from a Carta referral perspective, and even what we see that's currently on the books.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Christian.\n\nChristian Bolu\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous\n\nGood morning, Ted and Sharon. Maybe on Wealth Management organic growth, first of all, if I look at flows over the last three years. Total flows have been somewhat short of that sort of $1 trillion target and have been at the lower end of your 5% to 7% organic growth target. Maybe just talk through how you think about the ability to accelerate organic growth going forward, and then maybe confidence level in that $1 trillion target.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhat I would like to note here is this is a really, I think in the environment that we've been in the last two years, I think this is a remarkable outcome, especially if you look and you compare it to our peer set. Anyone who's been able to actually aggregate assets were best-in-class.\nA lot of that best-in-class has to do with the fact that, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, the vast majority of the assets, the new assets that we're seeing over the course of this last year has been on the advisor-led channel, and we've talked about some of the headwinds that are going from a cyclical perspective that I think are beginning to abate, and those have been, you know, spending of money.\nYou're not necessarily seeing as much money in motion, and you aren't seeing monetization events from Workplace corporates. You add the self-directed channel, you're not necessarily seeing as much money coming in from the Workplace side. You're not necessarily seeing monetization events, so people aren't getting that cash.\nYou're not seeing companies going public. Those things are beginning to turn. These results were really led from the advisor-led channel, from new clients and existing clients, new clients being really important. I think that there's a lot of opportunity there in terms of the 5% to 7%.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. What I'd add to that, Christian, is sort of a big picture answer and a little picture answer. My little picture answer would be just taking a look again at slide nine, fee-based flows. You know, that is the, that's sort of the core of the funnel, and we've been talking about that every quarter, and Jed Finn running Wealth very much has been focused on that too.\nYou see that the number just continues to move, $109 billion last year or two years ago, $123 billion in 2024. So, fee-based flows, that's kind of the ultimate outcome. You see that we are seeing this incremental activity now in the self-directed product from clients who, they kind of have the kind of experience that we talk about when they make their way to a financial advisor. It could prove very sticky.\nMy big picture observation though would be, one, I know you know this, but by way of sort of reminder just given what, what's happened in the market over the last year. When we did this call a year ago the combined assets for wealth and Investment Management stood at $6.6 trillion. As you know, we said we're, you know, we're going to get to $10 trillion, and we're going to keep going. In a year we've gone from $6.6 trillion to $7.9 trillion, so that is a $1.3 trillion increase in a year.\nNow of course we've had the kind of markets that are, you know, take asset prices higher. I think that speaks for itself in terms of our ability to continue to stay on. What really is what I would have folks paying attention to, which is just this commitment to get to $10 trillion. Whether that takes X years or X plus one year or X plus two years.\nWe want to get the kind of assets that ultimately work their way through the funnel. You say, well, what's the KPI there? I see the KPI there is going back to slide nine, which is are we increasing the TAM of relationships? Are we doing that across the financial advisory lever through Workplace and through self-directed. Are we doing all three? The answer is yes. Are we seeing enough net new assets that it's actually material? Clearly, at $250 per annum, that is a material number.\nHow are we doing on that? Which, you know, you can model a multiple, a nice multiple on which is fee-based flows. There it is on the right. I'm less wrapped around the axle. Whether we are at 700 or 800 versus a trillion two, three in a given three-year period.\nMore focused on sort of the composition of the funnel, that the assets are growing materially, but that ultimately we are translating that across a broader number of clients, again 19+ million and that ultimately at least for some of them translates into financial advisory fee-based flows. That's the right side. That's kind of the way we're thinking about it. Christian, in the context now of the integrated firm.\n\nChristian Bolu\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous\n\nVery fair. Thanks for the full answer. Maybe another quick one here on just comp leverage, very strong expense discipline, especially in ISG comp. I'm sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but is the 2024 full year ISG comp ratio of 31% kind of a good place to run going forward, obviously, assuming revenue continues to grow?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes, obviously. Christian, as you can tell, we look at comp on a full year basis, and you did have outperformance as it relates to the revenue in the fourth quarter on a relative basis. You do see changes within that comp. We do not give full year guidance specifically on one expense line.\nWe manage the company holistically. When we think about our expenses, we are looking at our overall efficiency of the firm. What I would pay attention to is on the last page of the targets, the 70% efficiency ratio goal that we have stated over the long term.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhat I'd add to that is, listen, we're running a talent business, and we pay for performance. Performance comes in sort of, the upside for our partners comes in two forms. One is through compensation over many years, which is why tenure matters, and of course total return in stock ownership, which is, as you know, a critical part of partner compensation. That is the thinking.\nOf course, when you have good years. You experience some operating leverage in comp, which then flows to the bottom line. In tougher years, as you know, the comp ratio moves higher. What we did do in 2023 in the second half was some of the tough work around culling and doing some lateral work.\nThat obviously has the, if it's done right, both enhances the efficiency of the income statement, but also allows for some incremental productivity on the top line of those bankers, traders, salespeople, structure, and risk management folks as they begin to kind of gestate over the two, three years after that. We feel like we came out at a good place there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Before we move to our next question, in an effort to get through all of the remaining questions in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. For our following question, we'll move to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey Devin.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nAnalyst, Citizens JMP\n\nThanks so much. Hey Ted. Hey Sharon. I just have one on Investment Management. Slide 12 you lay out, Parametric has been a great success story in the alternatives bucket management. Overall, it's still less than 10% of firmwide revenue. I know the alt bucket specifically is an area of focus, but I'm curious, areas like private equity, private credit, there's a lot of secular growth there.\nI know you have ambitions to grow private credit, but how do you think about that becoming a larger strategic piece of Morgan Stanley, and what's the appetite there to maybe do acquisitions to step function or accelerate that?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhen we look at, you know, what I would focus you on as we think about Investment Management more broadly is the fact that, as you know, we are looking to create a diversified platform, and we obviously were able to do that, as you mentioned, through acquisitions and specifically through the acquisition of Eaton Vance.\nWhen we think about both Parametric and a lot of the fixed income products, we're beginning to see a lot of reaping of those synergies across the Wealth Management business, across MSIM, and across all of the initiatives that we laid out at the beginning. Remember what we said is we thought there was more to do on Parametric, specifically on the retail side. That's working.\nWe're seeing increased participation from our FAs retail clients, and even asset managers talk leverage that Parametric product. We have also noted that we plan to think about things like fixed income, use fixed income, and see international distribution that was evidenced this quarter. A lot of the flows that we saw there have to do with international distribution. The synergies themselves are working already.\nI think there's much more to do just on bringing the two franchises together. As we see continued investment with different parts of private credit, different parts of private equity, and different parts of infrastructure, we will take part in those secular growth trends as they move forward.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Dan.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Good morning. One more question just on wealth, can you talk about advisor retention, kind of recruitment and backlogs here, then you used to talk about the companion accounts within wealth and Workplace. Curious if there's any update on where that sits, and some of the progress you're seeing within that initiative.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I'll take that. In terms of the workplace in general and how we're beginning to see the transitions in the companion accounts, what I would focus you on is companion accounts were something that we were looking at at the beginning of time when we had previously together the E*TRADE and the Morgan Stanley platforms.\nThat integration is largely complete. What we're more focused now is actually better understanding the channel migration, and those are the numbers and statistics that we've been giving over the last couple of calls. More specifically, what I mean by channel migration is we have Workplace assets that began at some point in Workplace, and we're seeing them move into the advisor-led concept.\nOver the last five years or so since 2020, we've seen $300 billion coming and initiating at some point from Workplace and moving into that advisor-led channel. That has been a big part of the move towards first transactional and then that movement from transactional flows into fee based. Those are more of the metrics that I'd point you to on the forward. When we think about being able to mark ourselves to market from a funnel perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nThank you. Hi Ted. Thank you. Can you guys share with us, many investors, many of us share your optimism on the outlook for Morgan Stanley and the business? Can you share with us the risks? Aside from the obvious geopolitical risks globally, what risks or curve balls are you guys trying to keep your eyes on for this year? Again, things do look very good for yourselves and others. What are some of the risks you guys talk about on a regular basis?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nNeedless to say, we're constantly running a number of stress tests as you think about the risks, geopolitical, macro in nature, counterparty risks. That's been a lot of the focus when you think about the velocity of the balance sheet and all of the capital metrics that we have, making sure that we're in a position to constantly refresh.\nLook, when we think about, if we look back at any of the episodes that we've talked about and then a lot of the risks that we've learned, we're constantly thinking about where are there tall trees, how do you see the velocity of different positions that you have. It's very hard to pin down and say, well, what match risk have you not necessarily solved for, because generally speaking, there is something brand new that one.\nI don't know that anyone knew that there would be a global pandemic, right? The underlying risk of what does a global pandemic mean? You think about even the risk that you might have seen over the course of this quarter. You have an election. We don't know what's going to happen with the election. None of us knew what would necessarily happen with the election. You look at the risk, you look at tall trees, you think about being able to bring down, what can you bring down quickly?\nHow do you think about velocity? How do you run scenarios? What does it mean for higher rates? What does it mean for lower rates? We look at different geographical exposures as well to try and better understand how we can manage all of that dynamism as you move forward.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI guess what I'd add to that, Gerard, is most of the risks that we have been looking at in this period are, and Sharon kind of went through a whole panoply of them. They are largely in the buckets of either the implications or the reality of regime change around interest rates, that the period of zero interest rates and zero inflation is now passed, and that this hot coal that we feel now tilted more towards inflation.\nIf there was a downside risk, it would be something that felt more stagflationary, that we are running risk scenarios around that. There might be periods when it feels a little colder again. That is all sort of imputed in the language of interest rate policy around the world. That's sort of bucket one, the end of financial repression. Bucket two is the geopolitical uncertainty and tension that we're seeing that has built over the last number of years and will continue.\nThat's important to us because, of course, we're running a global business. There may be places where there are re-equitization opportunities, and there may be places where there is outsized risk on behalf of clients. We have to navigate that as well. Those are the two major buckets, I think, of our time. That is why it's so important that we were able to put up a quarter that concluded a year where we had the kind of consistency we had on the top line, on the bottom line.\nWe can't undertake that will be the case in every market context. If you think about the year we just had. There were multiple years within that year. The fact that the enterprise, through the businesses we're in, was able to generate that kind of consistency on the top and bottom line, I think augurs well for a period where we think, all things being equal, the denominator of opportunity should improve.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

Please enter your passcode followed by the pound or hash key. Thank you. Your passcode is confirmed. Please wait while you are joined to the event.\nThank you for joining the Morgan Stanley Earnings Conference. Please continue to stand by as we will be going live shortly. Thank you for standing by. You're on hold for the Morgan Stanley earnings call. We'll be going live momentarily. We appreciate your patience.\nGood morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's second quarter 2024 earnings call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. The firm generated $15 billion in revenue, $1.82 in EPS, and a 17.5% return on tangible in Q2. Solid earnings and demonstration of operating leverage completes a strong H1 2024, $30 billion in revenue, $6 billion in earnings, and an 18.6% return on capital in institutional securities. We're beginning to see the benefits from our continued focus on our world class investment banking franchise. With revenues up 50% year-over-year, including a 70% increase year-over-year in fixed income underwriting. In institutional equities, we are back with a $3 billion quarter. In wealth, we posted margins of 27%, and across wealth and investment management we've now grown total client assets to $7.2 trillion on our road to 10 trillion+. Together we delivered strong operating leverage.\nFurther, on the back of the annual stress test results, we announced that we will increase the dividend by $0.075 for the third year in a row to $0.925, reflecting the growth of our durable earnings over time. During the quarter, we built $1.5 billion of capital, and at quarter-end, our CET1 ratio is 15.2%, 170 basis points above the forward requirement. Our capital position provides us the flexibility to continue to support dividend growth, support our clients, and buy the stock back. Opportunistically, the quarter also showed continued balance in both top line and profitability across the major segments. Wealth and institutional securities produced $6.8 billion and $7 billion in revenue respectively. With earnings also roughly split between our institutional businesses and wealth and investment management. Our businesses are working closely together to maximize adjacent opportunities across the integrated firm across the investment bank.\nNavigating changes in the cycle means being deliberate around risk management, and, given geopolitical uncertainty, where we spend our time to deliver clients solutions and to capture share in wealth management. We continue to focus on aggregating assets and delivering strong advice in investment management. We are investing in secular growth areas including customization, and real assets. Year-to-date annualized growth in net new assets in wealth management is over 5% with another strong quarter of over $25 billion in fee-based flows. Strong fee-based flows support daily revenue, which, on average, continues to be about $100 million each day this year throughout, and show the stability and continued growth of the wealth franchise. We're well navigating the continued uncertainty around forward rate path, geopolitics, and now the US political cycle, and expect those to be the themes for the balance of the year.\nWe remain focused on our best-in-class talent and building out best-in-class infrastructure to support ongoing growth across wealth and investment management, and institutional securities. I wanted to reiterate our strategy, which is clear to advise individuals and institutions around the world in raising, managing, and allocating capital. World class execution demands that we deliver strong earnings and returns through the cycle, that we do so while maintaining robust capital levels, and that we deliver on a durable growth narrative across the segments, and that Morgan Stanley executes on this strategy in a first class way. Blue. That's it in a nutshell.\nFinally, in reflecting on this weekend's assassination attempt, we share in the hope that in the months to come we will as Americans find ways to unify and preserve our better selves. With that, Sharon will now take us through the quarter in greater detail.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, thank you, and good morning. In Q2, the firm produced revenues of $15 billion. Our EPS was $1.82, and our ROTCE was 17.5%. Results highlight the power and scale of our integrated firm. The resilience of the US economy and a more stable near-term outlook on rates supported conviction amongst clients. Institutional securities drove performance, led by strength in equity and a pickup in investment banking. Wealth management also delivered on our established strategy, reporting record durable asset management fees and strong fee-based flows. Together, improved confidence and higher client engagement, along with our focus on prioritizing investments, yielded operating leverage and profitability. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%, benefiting from scale and reductions in our expense base.\nYear to date expenses benefited from lower litigation expenses, the absence of back office integration, related costs, and severance, as well as our dedicated effort to prioritize our current spend on prioritization. We remain committed to client and asset growth, technology, and targeted investments to ensure robust infrastructure that supports growth and addresses ongoing regulatory expectations. Now to the businesses.\nInstitutional securities revenues of $7 billion increased 23% versus last year, capturing the strength of the integrated investment bank across US and international markets. Higher activity in Asia contributed to results. Strong performance in institutional equity as well as debt underwriting demonstrate the breadth of our client franchise. In our markets, business opportunities unfolded on the back of global political events and macroeconomic data. Investment banking revenues were $1.6 billion. The 51% increase from the prior year was broad-based. We continue to invest in investment banking across talent and lending, broadening and deepening our global coverage footprint in key sectors including financials, healthcare, technology, and industrials. These investments are beginning to have an impact as capital markets improve and activity picks up. Advisory revenues were $592 million reflecting an increase in our completed M&A activity versus the prior year.\nThe pre-announced M&A backlog continues to build and suggests diversification across sectors. Equity underwriting revenues of $352 million improved versus the prior year, driven by increases across most products, but remained below historical averages. From a geographical perspective, we brought a number of transactions to market in Europe and Asia, demonstrating the importance of having a strong global market footprint. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $675 million, well above five-year historical averages. Results reflect a meaningful pickup in non-investment-grade loan and bond issuance as tighter spreads and strong CLO issuance provided opportunities for refinancing. The investment banking backdrop continues to improve. Led by the US, the advisory and underwriting pipelines are healthy across regions and sectors. Inflation data has continued to moderate, which has helped stabilize front-end rates and support boardroom confidence and sponsor re-engagement.\nAs buyers and sellers make progress to close the valuation gap. We expect that we are still in the early innings of an investment banking rebound, subject to changes in rate path expectations and geopolitical developments. Our integrated investment bank is well positioned to service our clients.\nTurning to equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business. Equity revenues of over $3 billion, up 18% compared to last year, reflect strong results across business and regions. Higher client engagement, dynamic risk management, and strength in Asia all contributed to performance. Prime brokerage revenues were strong and increased from the prior year as client balances reached new peaks. Regionally, we witnessed higher client activity in Asia and seasonal patterns in Europe. Cash results increased versus last year reflecting higher volumes across regions. Derivative results were up versus last year's second quarter as client activity was higher and the business navigated the market environment well. Further, the business benefited from corporate activity on the back of convertible issuances. Additional evidence of the integrated firm at work. Fixed income revenues of $2 billion increased year-over-year.\nMacro performance was up versus the prior year despite lower realized volatility. Clients were engaged around elections and political events in the quarter. Micro results improved year-over-year driven by the growth of our more durable revenues as we continue to support our clients with financing solutions. Solid results in commodities were in line with the prior year. Turning to ISG lending and provisions in the quarter, ISG provisions were $54 million driven by certain individual commercial real estate loans. Net charge-offs were $48 million, primarily related to two commercial real estate loans for which we had previously already taken provisions. Turning to wealth management, wealth management delivered strong results generating revenues of $6.8 billion with record asset management fees. Our PBT margin continued to make progress towards our goal, demonstrating our ability to grow and generate operating leverage through the cycle.\nWe are delivering on our differentiated scaled multichannel asset gathering strategy. Wealth management client assets reached $5.7 trillion. Moving to our business metrics in the second quarter. Pretax profits was $1.8 billion, up year-over-year, with a reported margin of 26.8%. DCP negatively impacted our margin by approximately 100 basis points. The margin demonstrates the inherent operating leverage of our asset gathering strategy. We are improving the efficiency with which we run the business. Asset management revenues of $4 billion were up 16%. That's more than $500 million in fees versus the prior year. That's driven by higher average asset levels and the impact of cumulative positive fee based flows in the quarter. Fee based flows of $26 billion were strong, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of over $20 billion, bringing the year to date fee based flows to $52 billion.\nWe are seeing a steady migration of assets from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts, evidence that investments in our client acquisition funnel are paying off. Fee-based assets now stand at $2 trillion. Net new assets were $36 billion, reflecting headwinds from seasonal tax payments year to date. Net new assets are $131 billion, representing 5% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net flows will be lumpy in any given period of time and impacted by both the macroeconomic environment and business-specific factors. We believe both tax-related outflows and increased spending, particularly among high net worth clients, impacted flows this quarter. Still, our first half NNA growth remains solid. Transactional revenues were $782 million. Excluding the impact of dcp, revenues were up 5% versus last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity-related transactions.\nBank lending balances grew by $4 billion to $151 billion, evidence that as the macroeconomic backdrop stabilizes, our lending capabilities can be met and can meet our diversified client needs. Total deposits of $343 billion remain stable, with sweep deposits down approximately $10 billion sequentially, mostly offset by growth in CDs. Net interest income was down modestly to $1.8 billion, reflecting the decline in sweeps, which was largely attributable to the seasonality of tax payments. The wealth management business continues to perform well, aggregating assets, generating fees, and benefiting from scale and our differentiated offering consistently earning approximately $100 million a day. In Q3, we intend to make changes to our advisory sweep rates against the backdrop of changing competitive dynamics.\nThe impact of these intended changes will be largely offset with the expected gains from the repricing of our investment portfolio. Therefore, Q3 NII will be primarily driven by the path of sweeps, and NII could decline modestly in Q3. Importantly, inclusive of these pricing changes, the rate path, and our expectations around client behavior, we believe that NII should inflect higher as you look out into next year. Our wealth management strategy is predicated on gathering assets, meeting our clients' lending needs, and offering advice. Asset management fees, the core of our wealth management strategy, continues to produce strong results, reaching a record this quarter. Taken together, we delivered a strong margin, and we continue to work towards 30% margins over time.\nThis quarter we reached approximately 19 million in relationships across our three channels, and we continue to invest in order to deepen engagement. AI tools are helping advisors grow, and Wealth Management's partnership with institutional securities is increasing connectivity around our workplace offering. These investments have supported flows to our advisor-led channel where average client duration is nearly 15 years and growing. The steady progress supports our journey towards 10 trillion+ in total client assets. Turning to Investment Management.\nRevenues of $1.4 billion increased 8% from the prior second quarter supported by higher asset management revenues. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher average AUM. Total AUM ended the quarter at $1.5 trillion. Performance-based income and other revenues were $44 million as gains were driven primarily by our infrastructure, US private credit, and US private equity funds. Reflecting our investments in secular growth areas, we recorded long-term net outflows of approximately $1 billion. We continue to see strong momentum across areas of strategic focus, namely parametric. Consistent with current industry trends, we saw outflows in our active equity strategies. Our business is well positioned given strength in areas of secular growth such as customization, direct indexing, and private alternatives. Our continued focus on global distribution combined with our deep structuring and product creation capabilities should support incremental growth.\nTurning to the balance sheet, total spot assets decreased $16 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%. Client activity was strong and markets were open. We actively supported clients with a focus on velocity of resources. We also grew our CET1 capital by $1.5 billion, reflecting strong earnings and continued capital distribution. The most recent stress test results reaffirm our durable business model and strong capital position. For the third year in a row, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075.\nHaving generated over $3.85 of earnings per share and an 18.6% ROTCE year to date, we enter the back half of the year from a position of strength with a robust capital base to support clients. Investment banking pipelines are healthy and diverse, dialogues are active, and markets are open. In wealth management, strong fee based flows and the realization of operating leverage continue to demonstrate that our strategy is working. As capital markets become more active, we see opportunities for retail clients to engage and over time deploy their cash and cash equivalent balances into fee based products. With that, we will now open the lineup to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are now ready to take in questions. To get in the queue, you may press star and the number one on your touch tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star and the number two on your touchtone telephone. You are allowed to ask one question and one follow up. Then we will move to the next person in the queue. Please stand by while we compile our Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nHi there.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nGood morning.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Glenn.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nGood morning, Sharon. I appreciate all the upfront commentary on NII and Wealth. I wanted to drill down a little bit on what you said. So if you have 2 trillion and client assets in advisory and they keep a handful of percent of money in cash. That change you're making in rate paid on deposits and advisory accounts can add up to like a good amount of money. So I wanted to get a little more sharper focus on what you said about 2025 NII and then what exactly did you say the offset is on the NII? Thanks.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. Thanks, Glenn, for the question. Actually, the portion of the sweep balances that are impacted are, as you mentioned, the sweep on the Advisor LED channel, which is actually a small portion of the overall BDP that we disclose. So it is a small portion of that overall stack, and the increase in pricing and is being offset largely by the repricing of the investment portfolio. Right. So as things mature and that investment portfolio reprices, it's that change in the quarter amount that will offset it when we look ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nIs there a particular reason why you only have to focus on repricing in this small portion of the advisor-led channel, meaning not to all?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Certainly. What I would note there is that what we think about when we think about sweeps broadly is mainly in transactional accounts. In those transactional accounts we have a wide range of choices and products for our clients and so therefore they have a lot of options as you think about their transactional accounts and brokerage.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning Ebrahim.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, Ted. Maybe sticking with NII and more importantly on pre-tax margin. Right. You had an extremely strong quarter, the stock's weaker this morning and it has to do with the NII drag on wealth, revenues, and margin. So one, I think Sharon. Your level of visibility into NII, lots of moving pieces around client behavior, maybe we get interest rate cuts. Just give us a sense of if history is any guide on what rate cuts would imply for client behavior or is there cash to assets that you're looking at that gives you comfort around NII potentially stabilizing post Q3, and then maybe for you a question. Go ahead. Yep.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. So why don't I take that and then you can ask your second question. So you are pointing out a great point, Abraham, as we look ahead through time, which was the second point of my guidance: that when we look over the next year, we are seeing and we expect that we should see an inflection in NII. And that is predicated on the points that you mentioned, which is that as you see rate cuts, we would expect those balances to stabilize. Remember, outside of the tax quarter, this particular quarter we had been seeing a stabilization in those sweep deposits. So it's important to recognize that that has been happening, reaching that frictional level of transactional cash. So that would likely continue.\nThen over time you'd also begin to see a benefit as rates were to be cut, that BDP could actually see inflows, which you've seen from a historical perspective. But in addition to that, you have two other factors. One is the repricing of the portfolio, which I've also already mentioned. The second piece has to do with lending. We look to continue to support our clients with lending products, and you are beginning to also see that potentially reach an inflection. This is the first quarter that we've seen this type of lending growth since the interest rate hikes began. We've seen now use of SBL products rather than just it being offset by paydowns. So those are all encouraging signs when we look ahead over the course of the next year for NII.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. I guess my second question was just talking to investors. When we look at the 30% pre-tax margin target, the question is whether this is aspirational, whether the bar is set too high given how competitive the business is. So remind us in terms of your comfort level on that 30% pre-tax margin and to the extent you can, the timeline of when we get there and when we get there, should that be a sustainable pace for the business? Thanks.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Ebrahim. Confidence level high.If you take a step back, there are three pieces to the wealth management line: asset management, transactional, net interest income. As you know, in the asset management context, those are fees that are going to fee-based accounts, advisory-led. Those figures are up 4% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. That is fee-paying advice. Last quarter, the net new assets into that category was $26 billion. So fee-based flows. That continues to be a growth piece of the wealth management story. The second pillar is transactional. Transactional has been relatively weak, which is a link to general weakness in overall capital markets activity. As you hear from our bullish commentary with respect to overall corporate finance activity in the investment bank, that will bleed through over time to the transactional line, and then, third, the net interest income line.\nAs Sharon said, that will inflect and should inflect over the next year. You put those together, the scale of the business, the funnel, and the processing of $100 million of revenues a day that continue to grow. We are going to continue to achieve operating leverage. It's that simple. We're investing in E*TRADE, we're investing in the traditional advisor, and we're spending a lot of time top of house focused on workplace, which we think is an enormous opportunity across our corporate and sponsor base.In January I had said 30% was the goal. We were in the mid-20s. We just printed 27% GAAP, 28% XTCP. It's a core stated objective. It will take some quarters to get there, but we intend on achieving it over time as we continue to grow assets and scale in the business.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Ted, you've said this and Sharon repeated this, that the industry is only in the early innings of an investment banking rebound. I have to say we've heard that for a couple years. So now is this time. Why is this time real? Do you expect the rebound to continue through normally slow summer period before the election? How many years? What gives you confidence that this is for real, and how much is your backlog up quarter-over-quarter?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nIt's an excellent question because you're exactly right that a number of folks have been calling for this, and it has been sort of a delayed spurt if you will. But I think now we're seeing some tempering of the inflation prints and some normalization rates. We're also beginning, along with that, to see the market broaden out. You of course have seen that over the last number of weeks, and I think we can now expect broader corporate finance activity to quicken, whether that is across the corporate community, or sponsors, or other institutions. And the early sign of this kind of activity can be seen in the convertibles product. Global convertibles activity is up significantly, and as you know, on the margin ladder it typically goes converts, IPO, and then M&A. In the context of bake-offs and the like.\nIn some spaces we're seeing bake-offs running at triple plus the year-over-year rate that they were at for sectors and for some of our client groups. We've been seeing now the launch of traditional IPOs, and we're seeing MA pipeline kicking in. So corporate community, sponsor community, cross-border community. We're in the early stages of a multi-year investment banking led cycle. If you believe the economy is going to hold up, led by the US, you should expect then to see that if there's some regulatory normalization too across a whole bunch of the sectors that are typically most active. So we are quite convicted on this call.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nJust one pushback, I mean, with interest rates so much higher than they've been in the past, don't you think that could get in the way when people are looking to borrow money for deals and the like? Is this a matter of simply waiting for rates to go lower, or that's not going to get in the way?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI mean, it's a fair question. You've written about this in the context of, you know, what was the normal before financial repression? Right. I would take the view that in the context of the last 15 years, even some normalization, because I don't know that we're going to go into a full blown rate cycle. To your point, some normalization of rates will still have you at 3% or 4% on the front end and even some steepening potentially. So now we're just back to the old weighted average cost of capital of the mid-90s and most normal economic periods. And.\nThe game will have to go on because there's just been so much activity that has been suppressed by any kind of measure, percentage of asset stock, percentage of market cap. The stickiness that we're seeing in the sponsor community too needs to unglue. There is an enormous, as you know, multi-trillion dollar stockpile between the two sides of sitting on inventory that needs to be released and then dry powder that's been raised that will act as a competitive weapon against the competitive bid from the corporate community that has to contend with the reality of a smaller world with real sovereign risk and real cost of capital differences from one jurisdiction to another.\nIn short, unless you were to tell me we're going to go into full-blown recession, which none of us can call, and that even if we saw rates normalize to something that is along the lines of the historic 4% on the front end, you will see over the next number of quarters, and really over the next number of years.\nA resumption of more normalized MA activity. With the key difference being that the financial sponsor community is now institutionally come of age. They have global reach, they can work the entire capital structure, they will work in concert with corporate partners. As you know, they don't actually have to act as lone wolves, and they can work with us to finance the package. So it's not just the straight MA advice or the straight IPO would also be bespoke offerings in the private public space, interest rate and foreign exchange hedging, and the other ornaments on the investment banking tree that a couple of the leading global investment banks can bring.\nThis is really why over the last couple years, to the extent we've done so-called front office hiring, it really has been to target several very high quality investment bankers who typically have spent their entire careers at one firm and have decided to come to the Morgan Stanley platform. And we're seeing the fruits of that across industries. So I am quite bullish on it, certainly take your point. That has been a number of quarters on the sort of on the promise. But I think as we get into 2025 and the election coming and then the election behind us, we should see that activity continue on a sustainable pace.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Dan.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Good morning. Was hoping to get a little bit more color on the flows in the quarter within wealth, maybe the breakdown from the channels, and contribution. Last quarter I think we saw Family Office be an outsized contributor, but hoping to get a little bit more color on where the flows were sourced in Q2.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure, I'll take that. We continue to see broad-based sourcing in terms of where those assets are coming from in this particular quarter. As I mentioned, the biggest offset and drag though is really from taxes. So you still have workplace accounts, you still have the advice-based account directly, you still have self-directed. All those places remain contributors. What continues in my mind to be most interesting though isn't just the contribution that you're getting from the three various channels but the fact that you have in the advice-based channel. It's not just coming from existing clients but it's split with existing, and net new clients and some of those net new clients are also relationships that are being sourced from workplace.\nI would not just directly focus on what channel it is coming from, but how you are seeing those channels and that interplay work because that's actually the power of the differentiated platform. Once you have somebody who wants more differentiated advice from self-directed, speaks to an advisor. That advisor sees new clients bring in assets, and then that's new acquisitions into the funnel and eventually into fee-based. It's really the whole ecosystem that I would call your attention to rather than just one isolated leg.hich is\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhich is part of the reason that workplace is so important because if workplace can continue to experience success amongst the corporate and sponsor community, that has an affinity effect on the top of the house at those institutions in terms of their own wealth, and then potentially other products around it. It can be an indirect sale where you aren't necessarily going directly to the prospective client via the FA, but you could actually work potential clients through the institutionalized effect of workplace where we do a great job educating on wellness, financial wellness, and then effectively institutionalizing ourselves by overseeing incentive comp through the Morgan Stanley Solium product. And having succeeded on an MS at-work mandate, which, as you know, is a durable, sticky asset that effectively is seen by the entire employee base.\nYou can start working your way up the funnel to the senior executives of that firm.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Brennan. Good morning, Brennan.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Yeah, good morning Ted. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to just drill down a little more. Forgive the second follow up here on the repricing change that you mentioned in your prepared comments, Sharon. So the repricing that we've seen in the securities book has been slow. So I'm just kind of curious as to why you think that will help offset the repricing actions that you're taking on the deposit side. Is that because it'll be a phased repricing and therefore there's an ability to have the phased benefit in the asset side offset? Then just a nitty gritty question on it, is the switch going to be to money fund sweep rather than higher yielding deposits and then that way you can just slowly replace that funding as you see Fed.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo thanks, Brennan. I'll take that question. Now all the changes that we'll make will happen, are expected to happen in Q3, and so those different changes will be made, and they'll be based on various competitive dynamics.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay, got it. Is this going to be focused on the advisory relationship similar to what we've seen from some other wirehouse competitors? Is it the changes that have recently been announced by Wells and B of A? Is that what you mean by competitive dynamics, or is there something else that I'm not aware of?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nNope, that's exactly as I stated. It will just be limited, as you said, to the sweeps that are dealt with in the Advisor-led channel.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Devin.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nAnalyst, JMP Securitie\n\nGreat, Ted. Hi. The first question just on another one on the GWM flows, Sharon. You mentioned tax season is a factor, which I completely get. But then you also mentioned increased client spending, and I just wanted to drill into that, just whether that's something that could continue, whether it was seasonal or influenced by inflation. Just trying to understand that component of the impact on flows.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, that's a really interesting question. I did call it out. We've seen increased spending by higher net worth and so higher income bands are certainly spending. We see that in the data alongside actual spending. We see that in purchases of homes. We see that in various tailored investments. So they are, that cohort, so to speak, is using its cash in different ways and its various investment in different ways. I too think that that's an interesting dynamic that's playing out. I know that others have mentioned it within their portfolios as well. It's certainly something we're seeing in our data.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nAnalyst, JMP Securitie\n\nOkay, got it, thank you. And then a follow up just on the interplay between investment banking and trading. And appreciate the comment on kind of the improving capital markets backdrop, which is great to hear, and kind of the expectation from our end that there's going to be a lot more primary issuance in equities, maybe in debt, as well as M&A picks up. So just trying to think about what that means for the trading businesses, equities, and fixed income, and whether you guys feel like we could maybe sustain around these really high levels or even, maybe even the wallet could move higher just as you get a stronger primary issuance market.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, I know that the competitive set will naturally speak to areas where integration can be an asset. Here we have, we believe, something really special inside of our institutional securities business, our so-called integrated investment bank, which has been ongoing for now. We're getting on seven or eight years. Now under Dan Simkowitz's direction. This is a sort of critical facet of business strategy at our place because you have now the appropriate and important relationships that have been built across fixed income, equities, and banking through our capital markets new issue business. You have those now having been compounded and advanced by the mobilization of some folks from one division to another. So there's real familiarity now with the work product.\nA lot of the work product, as you know, is not traditional vanilla IPOs. Yes, there are some on the horizon that are quite substantial, and we'd expect that to be an important part of the calendar. But there's also more bespoke product, whether it be convertibles or products in the private area, or products that effectively necessitate high quality structuring and advice and that can only be brought to the boardroom if you have world class investment bankers who can lean on the expertise of their colleagues, not just in the new issue business, but as appropriate in institutional equities and in fixed income. If you look at our fixed income business, for example, and fixed income underwriting, you'll see that the share gains have been quite extraordinary and that the year-over-year revenue number I believe is up 71%.\nThat speaks to the fine work that's been done by folks not just in the debt capital markets business, which is housed inside of our new issue business linked to banking, but also working closely with fixed income professionals, whether they are in the securitized products group, in our commodities area, broader credit, or in our macro space, that is interest rate and foreign exchange. When you get into the knitting of ISG, our integrated investment bank, you see that part of the reason that we are bullish, not just to Mike's earlier question on the denominator, but also on our ability to increase the numerator is not so much because we think there is a need to deploy a lot more capital.\nWe will do so as appropriate when the markets demand it, but that we are able to get the kind of bespoke advice for clients that comes from the familiarity of our people, the quality of the advice that is differentiated, and importantly that it's global so that we can bring it to the client base. So that is part of, I think, the secret sauce that we've been working hard on to generate above cost of capital returns inside the investment bank on a standalone basis. That obviously doesn't include even the synergies that we'd see across the firm into wealth and investment management.\nBut your question is on the investment bank specifically, and I feel really good about the way it's structured, the leadership that we have within it, the experience set, and then our ability now to tap into this next cycle, which will be different than the last one. Rates will be well higher than that of financial repression. We'll be toggling between some bouts of inflation and potential recession. We'll be dealing with the unpredictability going to not only our own cycle, US election cycle, but the world around us, but also the coming of age and the institutionalization of the financial sponsor community where we have very strong relationships with that leadership group from top to bottom across the investment bank, wealth and investment management.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our next question, we'll move to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nMaybe just starting off with a question, just on operating leverage within ISG year to date, the incremental margins are quite strong, just north of 80%. You spoke constructively on IB and trading, inflecting positively. Just want to better understand what you believe is a sustainable incremental margin as activity steadily builds, especially given some of the growth, at least from here, may skew a bit more heavily towards investment banking, which tends to be more compensable.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhen you look at it, I would really focus, Steve, on the efficiency ratio targets that we put for the whole firm. Right. We think that the firm can run at or below the 70% over time through a durable cycle. The issue with your specific question, as you yourself highlighted, is it depends on where those different revenues are coming from. So there might be periods of time where it's higher being. There might be periods of time where you have different jurisdictions associated with it. But broadly speaking, the enterprise was given 30% margins as it relates to wealth and the sort of wealth and investment management space. And then you have the ISG space. So by definition, if you're running at 70% efficiency ratio, more broadly, you look for an entire enterprise to run at somewhere of a 30% margin.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. The only thing I would add to that is, of course, as you know, there's real seasonality in the business. Fixed income tends to have its strongest quarter streetwide in Q1. Investment banking, typically in Q4, that's not every year, but that's typically how it shakes out. Q3 tends to be weaker in the summer months. Then it's sort of all about September. And obviously this September will be one that.\nWill be driven in part by sentiment around the upcoming elections. So that's kind of the seasonality piece. The other is just the scale within the businesses. I'd be remiss again not to sort of underscore the importance of having reached $3 billion in the equities business. This has been a leading business where we have been number one or number two for the last dozen years. We see the clients are much in demand of our services across cash, derivatives, and prime brokerage. Then connecting to investment banking, I think that business has also hit an inflection point again where they can continue to prosecute high-margin business through the cycle. All this, of course, is dependent on the economy holding up and general asset price levels. But given where we are right now, we're feeling good about that too.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nNo, thanks for that perspective. Just a follow up on the deposit discussion. Both you and your wirehouse peers announced similar actions on deposits, which you noted. Sharon, you mentioned it was informed by competitive dynamics. But I wanted to better understand if there's any feedback you or your peers had received from regulators that prompted the decision. Because from our vantage point, the timing of these pricing actions at this stage of the rate cycle is simply difficult to reconcile.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI'm sorry, Steve, we don't comment, as you know, on regulatory matters.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Fair enough. I had to try. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nGood morning, Ted.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning, Gerard. How are you?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nGood, thank you. You gave us good insights into your thinking about what the capital markets could bring, especially in investment banking. I think you touched on in your comments with, or maybe you, Sharon, that the transactional numbers could benefit from a stronger ECM business. Can you then take the next second derivative and share with us from your experience with Salomon, should we see that business pick up the workplace channel if more of these maybe private equity sponsor companies go public? Should the workplace channel see stronger revenues potentially in a stronger investment banking market over the next 12 or 18 months?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's a great question. I know, Gerard, a few years ago you also asked me about different values of those assets associated with what the underlying is. I completely agree with you. As you have workplace assets rise, the value of those client assets rise. New corporations issue their employees more stock. They also grow their employee base. It should absolutely add participants. It should add new corporates. It will add new net flows. And now that we have all of that, when you just had Solium, now you also have E*Trade and workplace, and the platforms are integrated. So as those flows flow into an E*Trade account, people can transact on that. Then, as Ted said, we can also offer financial wellness. So absolutely, it helps that ecosystem begin to work.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nVery good. Just as a follow-up, Ted, if I take a step back, obviously you guys have done a very good job in the last 10 years of growing organically, but then complementing that growth with acquisitions, once we get the Basel III endgame final proposal, maybe some G-SIB relief, can you share with us, as you look out over the next two, three years, is there any parts of the picture today that you'd like to enhance, possibly with acquisitions, or are you good where you are today?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI'll take the opportunity to sort of give a brief view on capital if I could, Gerard, and link that to potential external opportunities. We anticipated or we believed it was possible that we could have a tougher annual CCAR test. Indeed it was. What we've prioritized in potential uses of capital above all things has been dividend policy. As you know, we are increasing dividend again to $0.925, which at spot offers a 3.5% current 3.5% dividend yield. That is the continued highest priority on use of capital, if you include, of course, use of capital to inorganic opportunity. Second are clients. We have continued to lean in for clients across the business segments as appropriate, and you see the operating leverage across the businesses, particularly across the investment bank.\nWe've also thought about the buyback opportunistically and have been buying stock back and returning capital this past quarter, more than $2 billion between the dividend and the buyback, in a way that has been reflective of offering us that optionality. As we sit here today, we are 170 basis points above the buffer, and importantly, we continue to be in the 3.0% G-SIB buffer, which in one context wouldn't normally get much attention, but does get attention in the context of your question, which is sort of forward-looking strategic opportunity. It's worth noting if we can manage to stay at 3.0%, assuming the framework holds through whatever Basel brings, that will be our buffer in 2026. So we're 170 over, and we accreted $1.5 billion this quarter.\nExternal, that is, inorganic, therefore, is something we can think about. It's just not something we're going to think about in the short term. The reality is we've got our forced hierarchy. The forced hierarchy is dividend first, investing in clients as appropriate, achieving operating returns against that second, and then third, the buyback opportunistically down the road two, three, four years out if opportunities come across the horizon. Importantly, after we have some definition around Basel and continued potential refinement of what we understand to be inside CCAR formulation. So just general regulatory uncertainty. Sure, we might look at stuff, but I would tell you in the short term we're very happy with the acquisitions that we've made over the last 10, 12 years.\nWe are determined to generate operating leverage in each of the two major segments, wealth and investment management, and the integrated investment bank, and then to obviously hit our efficiency ratios of 70% and the margins and returns that we've talked about.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Please go ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning, Saul.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nGood morning. I wanted to follow up on the earlier question on the outlook for your sales and trading businesses. You kind of consistently done about $18 to 20 billion of annual revenue in the post-pandemic period in FICC in equities. And right now, we have a backdrop where we're going to see rate cuts. Markets are strong, issuance activity may pick up. At the same time, you have perhaps more competition from foreign banks who have lost share. So how do you see, do you have a view on how you see the wallet evolving for these businesses? Your ability to maintain or gain share in this backdrop? I guess ultimately, do you think you can grow revenues here from a base that is materially higher than what it was pre-pandemic?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "The answer to that is that we would like to grow share that is durable. We want to grow share in businesses that are connected to the core client base, whether it be the global asset managers, the leading alternative asset managers, private equity, and private credit players that come to the fore, and then our leading corporate and sovereign clients. There are products that can be offered. There are very few firms that can do that. Globally, we continue to have a world-class markets business. For example, in Asia, where I believe we have the largest equities business, we've been growing the business quite assiduously on the continent, in the UK, where our senior management has been putting in a lot of time and attention. And as you know, we have a differentiated joint venture with our friends and partners at MUFG in Tokyo.\nIf you consider the global footprint of the firm in a world that continues to be equities based, it continues to be an equities world. You see it in the asset price momentum in the US. You see now the potential for that to broaden to more names and more sectors. And that obviously gives opportunity for folks in the stock picking business, for example, where we've been very strong traditionally in equities, to do the cash derivs and prime brokerage suite that we offer. You could see continued uncertainty based on how the next administration handles the significant macro challenges facing the US, whether you'll see a steeper yield curve, where you'll see activity on the front and through the belly of the curve.\nThat of course offers all kinds of opportunities to the rates business and connected to corporate catalyst activity where on an M&A acquisition the acquirer may wish to inoculate themselves from rate or foreign exchange risk. That's a service that we offer. Again, I like the idea of growing durably inside the integrated investment bank. I like the idea that we are working in sandboxes with the appropriate capital controls around that, but that we're allowing enough breathing space so that when our lead clients are looking to engage in a once in every few years catalyst event, that we can fully offer the entirety of the advice and financing spectrum to them on demand.\nThe answer would be to grow and grow responsibly. I'd like to think we could inch up the numerator along with the denominator and that you would see that almost imperceptibly over the course of quarters and years.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nThat's helpful, thank you. Just, I guess, a quick follow up related follow up. ROE 14% in ISG in the first half of the year. Early on, as you highlighted in investment banking cycle, do you have a view on where the ROE that the institutional securities ROE can get to as the investment banking cycle kind of plays out? Is there a view on sort of what a normalized ROE would be here?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWe're still early, you know, we're still early in the cycle. We're watching it, of course. To the earlier question on when the green shoots come through on the high margin MA product, the reality of seasonality, the uncertainty of repath, geopolitics, US elections. It's hard to put a pin on what the returns will be in a given forward quarter until we kind of see some normalization in those uncertainties. Not to mention some of the regulatory stuff that we're dealing with as we speak. Basel. Basel, namely. But yes, you're right to point out that we are seeing some real operating leverage in the investment bank. Over the course of a number of years, as we think about not just the integrated firm, but the returns generated inside of wealth and investment management.\nThen we look at the returns inside the investment bank. We are measuring that and we're looking to have that contribute to the overall sustainable 70% efficiency of the firm.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

Please enter your passcode followed by the pound or hash key. Thank you. Your passcode is confirmed. Please wait while you are joined to the event.\nThank you for joining the Morgan Stanley Earnings Conference. Please continue to stand by as we will be going live shortly. Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning and happy spring in New York. Thank you for joining us. We entered 2024 with optimism, encouraged by improving boardroom confidence and an increasingly positive tone from our institutional and wealth management clients. The quarter was strong. We generated $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2.02 in earnings per share, and a 20% return on tangible equity. In a relatively constructive environment, these results highlight the power of our clear and consistent strategy, serving as trusted advisors to our clients, helping them raise, allocate, and manage capital. During the quarter, higher asset prices and an improved economic backdrop supported confidence with our wealth management client base. We saw greater activity both in the advisor-based and self-directed channels, resulting in higher adjusted margins of 27%. Net new assets grew by $95 billion. Investment management also generated positive long-term flows in the quarter.\nAcross both wealth and investment management, total client assets grew to $7 trillion, advancing toward our $10 trillion goal. As the new issue calendar returned for the first time in a number of quarters, it was great to see us regain our leadership position in Equity Capital Markets. More broadly, we saw building momentum in investment banking, both in our M&A and underwriting pipelines across corporate and financial sponsor clients. Institutional equities and fixed income both generated very solid results to round out a strong quarter in institutional securities. As ever, we remain focused on managing our resources, sweating the income statement, and being judicious with our capital. Our CET1 ratio was 15.1%. Our excess capital position allows us to support our clients, invest in our businesses, and return capital to our shareholders, particularly as regulators continue to evaluate Basel III endgame.\nAdditional regulatory clarity and a sustained capital markets recovery should have a multiplier effect across our global franchise, further unlocking the unique power of our integrated firm. I wanted to touch on the topic of client onboarding and monitoring in the wealth business with three short observations. First, this quarter's wealth management results speak for themselves with record revenues and strong metrics across the board, including strong margins and very strong net new assets. We are really pleased with this terrific performance, and we are going to keep on going. Second, this is not a new matter. We've been focused on our client onboarding and monitoring processes for a good while. We have ongoing communications with our regulators, as all the large banks do. As James said in January, we want to ensure we continue to be world-class in every aspect of this growing business.\nThird, to be clear, this is about processes. We have been spending time, effort, and money for multiple years, and it is ongoing. We've been on it, and the costs associated with this are largely in the expense run rate. To conclude, the first quarter 2024 aligns with the goals outlined in the January strategy deck: 15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2 of earnings, 7 trillion of client assets, and a 20% return on tangible. We have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of the firm. While the pipelines are healthy, there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Our job is to generate these kinds of durable results on a consistent basis.\nI'm very optimistic about what lies ahead for Morgan Stanley, and on behalf of our 2,300 managing directors and 80,000 employees, say to those listening to the call, we will deliver an integrated firm to clients and shareholders that is unmatched in both its integrity and in its intensity. Now, I'll turn it over to our excellent CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, to discuss the quarter in more detail.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, and good morning. In the first quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15.1 billion. Our EPS was $2.02, and our ROTCE was 19.7%. Our model is working as intended. The first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our scaled business and an improving backdrop. Benefits of durable revenues, particularly asset management fees in the wealth management business, stronger capital markets, and a continued focus on managing the full income statement all contributed to results. The firm's first quarter efficiency ratio was 71%, illustrating the inherent operating leverage in the model and our ongoing efforts to consolidate our expense base following multiple years of integration. Efforts are evidenced by the year-over-year reduction in professional services and marketing and business development spend. Lower legal expenses further supported the improvement in efficiency ratio. Now to the businesses.\nInstitutional securities revenues of $7 billion were up 3% versus the prior year, reflecting strong performance across businesses. First quarter revenues underscore the power of the integrated firm as our cross-divisional collaboration positioned us to capitalize on market opportunities. The geographical breadth continues to distinguish our franchise and puts us at the center of client activity as the backdrop improves across regions. Investment banking revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the prior year. A pickup in both equity and fixed income underwriting supported results, offsetting the year-over-year decline in advisory. Leading indicators continued to progress positively, including the preliminary re-emergence of sponsor activity. Advisory revenues of $461 million reflected a decline in completed M&A transactions. Equity underwriting revenues of $430 million more than doubled versus the prior year as IPO markets reopened for most of the quarter, alongside conducive markets for follow-ons.\nOur global reach supported our ability to lead cross-border transactions, and we regained our premier leadership position in equity underwriting league tables as global market volumes ticked up. Fixed income underwriting increased year-over-year to $556 million. Results were driven by strength in investment-grade and non-investment-grade bond issuance as clients took advantage of tighter credit spreads. Looking ahead, we expect the steady build of this business to continue. We are encouraged by the health of the advisory and underwriting pipelines. While the uncertainty of the rate path and geopolitical developments may impact the near-term conversion of pipelines to realize, conditions should improve over time, and the underlying trends suggest that confidence is increasing. We remain focused on expanding our reach through opportunistic hires, particularly as we continue to see diverse pipeline and increased sponsor activity. Turning to equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business.\nRevenues were strong, increasing 4% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. Results were supported by performance in derivatives and cash, and the franchise benefited from the scale of our prime brokerage business. Cash revenues increased year-over-year, reflecting broad-based strength in equity markets across the region. Performance in Japan was particularly strong, supported by higher volumes. Our increased coverage, augmented by our long-standing and unique partnership with MUFG, should be supportive over time. Derivative revenues were robust as the business navigated the market environment well, and client activity was strong. Prime brokerage revenues were solid as client balances increased back towards all-time highs on higher market levels. Results reflect the mix of client balances and narrower spreads. Fixed income revenues were $2.5 billion. Results declined slightly compared to the strong result last year.\nRecall last year's result benefited from increased client engagement on the back of idiosyncratic events, including those related to the US regional banks. Client demand for corporate solutions acted as a partial offset, reflecting the strength of our integrated franchise. Macro and micro revenues declined modestly year-over-year on lower volatility and client activity, which resulted in less transactional flow. Results in commodities increased year-over-year, supported by higher revenues in the North America power and gas business. Turning to wealth management, the business delivered strong results across all key metrics, demonstrating the continued power and differentiation of the engine we have built. Record revenues increased from the prior year to $6.9 billion, driven by record asset management fees from both a rising market and ongoing success in migrating clients to advisory relationships to better serve their needs. Transactional revenues, excluding DCP, were also strong as retail sentiment improved alongside institutional investors.\nImportantly, net interest income remained in line sequentially. Pre-tax profit was $1.8 billion, and the PBT margin was 26.3%. Together, DCP and the FDIC special assessment impacted the margin by approximately 115 basis points. The results highlight the inherent operating leverage embedded in the business, particularly as revenues rise on the back of cumulative strong fee-based flows as clients invest more in higher beta assets and transactional activity rebounds. Net new assets for the quarter were strong at $95 billion, with contributions from multiple channels, including our family office offering. Over time, our ability to deliver unique solutions to clients should continue to attract assets and lead to share capture. Fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong. Within fee-based flows this quarter, we saw particular strength from the migration of assets from the advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts.\nThis demonstrates that over time, assets migrate through the funnel into recurring revenue-generating accounts. Fee-based assets now stand at over $2 trillion. Asset management revenues were $3.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market levels and the cumulative impact of strong fee-based flows. Transactional revenues were $1 billion, and excluding the impact of DCP, were up 9% versus the prior year. The first quarter's results were driven by client engagement across products, including record activity in structured products. Investments in our platform allow us to support increased client demand. Bank lending balances were $147 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest growth in mortgages. Total deposits of $347 billion were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter as the decline in sweep balances was offset by continued demand for our savings offering.\nWhile sweep balances were down on a spot-to-spot basis, average sweeps were roughly in line with last quarter, broadly consistent with our modeled expectations. Net interest income was $1.9 billion, flat to the fourth quarter's results, consistent with our guidance. The moderate increase in average deposit costs was offset by several factors, including the reinvestments of assets at higher market rates. Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management.\nWe remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships, and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pre-tax profits over time. Investment management reported revenues of $1.4 billion, increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels. Total AUM increased to $1.5 trillion. Long-term net flows were strong at $7.6 billion. Inflows were driven by strengths in alternatives and solutions and reflect the benefits of our diversified product offering. Within alternatives and solutions, demand for Parametric customized portfolios was robust as retail clients, including our own wealth management clients, allocated investments to Parametric's equity-based products, underscoring the value of the integrated model. Flows were further supported by global interest in our active fixed income strategies. Liquidity and overlay services had outflows of $12.9 billion.\nPerformance-based income and other revenues were $31 million. Gains in US private equity and private credit offset lowered accrued carried interest in Asia private equity and real estate, demonstrating the benefits of a global diversified platform. We are seeing the benefits of ongoing investments in this business. We remain focused on customization, private credit, and our global distribution. Parametric, in particular, has allowed us to deliver the integrated firm, evidenced by the ongoing demand from our wealth management client base. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.1%, down 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter as we actively supported our clients in more constructive markets. We continue to deliver our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1 billion of common stock during the quarter. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter.\nThe vast majority of share-based award conversion takes place in the first quarter, resulting in a lower tax rate. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which, similar to prior years, will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside, as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion across wealth and investment management, we are on strong footing. Our wealth management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice and delivering our differentiated offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint. This, combined with the build of the investment banking pipelines and market confidence, provides us with momentum to deliver on our objectives over time.\nWith that, we will now open the line up to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are now ready to take in questions. To get in the queue, you may press star and the number one on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star and the number two on your touch-tone telephone. You're allowed to ask one question and one follow-up, and then we'll move on to the next person in the queue. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. We'll move to our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, thank you. I appreciate you not running away from a sensitive subject. I'm going to push the envelope and just ask one follow-up, if possible, on the wealth matter. I wonder if you could size the non-US\nwealth piece, whether it be in client assets or revenue for us, and correct me if I'm wrong, if that's the focus. And then, more importantly, do you think obviously, you had a pretty darn good quarter, so do you think this impacts any day-to-day or your ability to grow and onboard clients in the future? That's my real main question. Thank you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI think it's a great question, Glenn. Happy to take that and just follow up on exactly what Ted said, which is, as you said, the results really speak for themselves. This is a phenomenal business. We had record revenues, and we're in a great position. We have strong margins, strong net new assets, and no, there are no strategic changes to our business.\nThere are no changes in our ability to do business, and we're extremely confident in our ability to grow and to deepen the relationship with the breadth of firm offerings that we have to serve our clients. Specific to your question on the international business, it is small.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Ebrahim.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Maybe, Ted, for you, as we think about it was a strong quarter for investment banking underwriting. There seems to be a fragility to the macro outlook based on how rates have behaved on the back of inflation, geopolitics. Just give us a sentiment check of when you're talking to your corporate clients.\nHow resilient do you see the investment banking sort of trends in the sort of desire and appetite for corporates to engage in either DCM, ECM, M&A or large M&A activity as we look into sort of later in the year into the US elections? Thank you.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for your question. The pipeline is clearly growing. It's growing across sectors. It's growing on a cross-border basis. There are some who will be willing to take the regulatory risk at this point in the cycle, and there is activity that we will see both from the financial sponsor community and the corporate community who effectively be bidding with and against each other for assets.\nThis is a moment when most want to purify their business model or grow, and that scaling needs to take place now that the effects of COVID and supply chain are in front of us and geopolitics continue to be on our minds. It is not surprising that the C-suite wants to act. So I think we are in the early innings of a multi-year M&A cycle. On the back of that, we should continue to see all kinds of underwriting. What was interesting about this ECM quarter where we had real success was that it was a combination of IPOs from the Valley, capital raises from industrial companies, regional trades, cross-border unlocks. It was the whole potpourri of offerings, and we've also begun to see the beginning of event financing in the high-yield and leveraged loan market.\nSo I'm feeling good about this being early to mid-cycle for the classic investment banking and capital markets business around the world. And as you know, we are very active in Japan where we think activity will be heightened for years to come.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThat's good, caller. And just one quick follow-up, Sharon, on the wealth management NII and sweep deposits. I think the sense is that we're getting to a bit of a bottom on NII. Is that an accurate characterization? And should we stop worrying about a big cliff event where NII declines meaningfully from where we've trended?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI welcome the day where I stop getting questions on NII, so thank you.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYou can just say, \"Yes, I'm the team.\"\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI would characterize this as it's now the third quarter in a row that I've said that our sweep models and the client behavior is following client expectations.\nIt does feel as though we are reaching that frictional level of cash. Of course, we'll have to wait and see how things play out, but broadly speaking, it feels as though, like I said, we are at a place where you have what we would say is intra-quarter volatility associated with things that might be T-bills maturing, people putting things in markets, but that, again, is frictional levels of cash rather than large changes or movements in real client behavior, which is what you saw two years ago in the summer when we saw the large move in rates, which was a one-off event, and then you had, again, a very large event with the regional bank movements in the first quarter of last year.\nSo those are very specific events that we can look at, and since then, like I said, we have been working with our modeled expectations.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Good morning. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Steve. Good morning, Steve.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon. So maybe just starting off on the expense outlook. We saw some good progress on the expense front, and the KPIs are encouraging. Headcount was down year-on-year. Comp and non-comp surprised positively in ISG and wealth. And I was hoping you could just speak to your efforts to rationalize or optimize the expense base. And with IB and wealth fees expected to ramp consistent with the M&A commentary, Ted, that you cited, now how should we be thinking about incremental margins as these businesses, and particularly fees, start to grow?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nCertainly.\nLet's take just the expense big picture, and we obviously disclose the SEC drivers of expenses. I called them out. We've had multiple years now where we've been looking to integrate multiple acquisitions. And as we've come out of that, we've been able to reevaluate our expense base. I've talked about it in different pieces of our earnings call. Many times I've mentioned space. You can see even in the lines around occupancy in the actual disclosures. You could see bump-ups in space, where you're taking write-offs down in space, and then it begins to trend down again. So we're making big picture decisions around what do we actually need and where do we want to invest those growth drivers as we move forward. So consolidating the marketing dollars and figuring out what is the best use of those marketing dollars. Consolidating professional services.\nHow do we actually want to deploy full-time hires in those growth objectives? So in my prepared remarks, we talked about two things. We talked about taking expenses down in certain line items, but we also discussed investments, right? I talked about the fact that we're looking at opportunistic hires in M&A. We've discussed a lot about investing in Parametric and technology. We've been giving technological tools to our advisors and investing in the business. So it's a push-pull, and it's making sure, as Ted says, that we're sweating the income statement, and we're thinking about our resources efficiently and durably as we move forward through the cycle.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhat I'd add to that is if you just sort of had an intangible sense of what we talk about at our leadership meetings, our operating committee of a dozen people and the next group, the management committee of about three dozen, and then their leadership teams, I think it's fair to say, Steve, over the last five years, a large chunk of time was spent talking about capital efficiency, how we can optimize those toggles. And of course, with Basel III endgame pending and the annual CCAR process ongoing, we, of course, continue to dedicate time to that. But the sea change over the last number of quarters, and it has accelerated now into 2024, is we're actively talking about the income statement, about delivering earnings growth, earnings momentum. That obviously then ties into the returns on capital that we were able to generate this quarter.\nBut we're looking to make investments, strategic investments in top human capital now, and then when it comes about, but we're being pretty judicious about that. This is a great platform, and we have a great team, but we need to be running this thing super efficiently, and that is why reiterating the efficiency ratio of 70% in January was so important, and that we put up 71% this quarter, where it was a generally constructive environment. I think I called it a relatively constructive environment, but there's clearly more operating leverage to be had when you get to the higher brackets of ISG, and then as you move to the funnel and wealth. So the focus on generating that operating leverage and keeping the income statement really tight is very much on the minds of the leadership team.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great, caller.\nJust for my follow-up relating to the wealth management margins, unpacking some of the different component pieces, given continued strong fee momentum, nice to see the inflection in N&A too. It sounds like NII is close to stabilizing just given some of the key drivers and inputs. The focus on efficiency, just throwing all that in the blender, does suggest that this 26% is probably a reasonable jumping-off point, and you can build off that base. I was hoping you could maybe provide some context around that.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, what I would say is that we put out our goals in the last strategy deck, and we're obviously making progress towards those goals. When you think about what gets you to 30%, the framework that we've offered the investment community is that there are sort of three parts to it. The first is migration to advice.\nThe second, and really the monetization of the funnel, we'll go through this. The second, when you think about it, is solutions and products that we're offering. And then the third is the benefits of scale. And what was encouraging about this quarter is that all three of those things happened. The first being the fee-based flows that we saw at $26 billion came from brokerage accounts. They came from people taking money that was already in a channel that we've said will eventually be deployed, and it is being deployed, and that's what you're seeing here. If you look back, that particular transition, that conversion, is at a two-year peak. Again, encouraging colors, Steve. The second piece, solutions, products, differentiated offering. I called out structured products. People have interest in products, as Ted said, as markets begin to improve. Those could be new issuance. That can be derivatives.\nThat can be solutions through structured notes. That's what we're seeing beginning to happen here. So yes, again, an encouraging sign. And the third is that we continue to gain the benefits of scale and operating leverage. So all three things are working. Of course, there's room to run, but what we're trying to do is make sure that we also have the right trade-offs between investing in the business, giving ourselves room for technology, and being able to build a 30% margin for a sustainable business and durable revenues over time.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Good morning.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Brennan.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, how are you, Ted?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nSo excellent. I'd love to start with a question on NII.\nI know I've asked this in the past, but we saw stability in the wealth management NII, which, Sharon, you've spoken at length about both on this call and in the past. But we did see the firm-wide NII dip again, and it was the fourth quarter where the firm-wide NII declined. So could you explain how those diverged and maybe what caused some of that divergence?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. I think we've talked about it before, Brennan, but I'm happy to talk about it again and highlight that the reason that we point you to the wealth management NII, that's a business-driven NII. When we look at the trading NII and we look at firm NII, it really depends on the products that you have, where you're booking them, what you're using as your funding sources. That falls into the various pieces of the trading revenue.\nSo we call, we focus you in from our disclosures really on the wealth management NII when that NII is being driven by a business concept rather than just where you might be booking certain trading trades.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Got it. Is there something going on in the institutional NII that would cause sort of steady declines, and with those specific products, that maybe might be a trend that we could explore a little bit?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nNo, I would really step you back and tell you that that's not how we manage the business, and the trading revenue is going to fall where the trading revenue falls based on the products that we transact in in that quarter. And the wealth management revenue, I've given you the drivers with the deposits, with interest rates, with spreads, and with reinvestment. And they're really two separate things that you should be looking at.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. You had big year-over-year growth in wealth management client assets up by about 20%, but the wealth management revenues increased by 5%. Still decent growth, but it seems like a little disconnect there. So I'm wondering what kind of wealth management client assets you're growing.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nCertainly. So when you're growing the wealth management client assets, it's going to be all sorts of places. Like I said, we begin to see assets. They can come in actually in the brokerage side, and over time, they will migrate or can migrate based on the client preferences into the advice side. Those different assets are going to have different fees associated with them. For us, it's about growing the funnel, Mike, and then beginning to see this movement towards advice.\nNow, I'd also point out that once you're in the advice-led channel, even if you're in the fee-based channel, you might not directly be in the S&P. There's a composite. There might be preferences to be in fixed income products. There might be preferences to be in equity products. But for us, it's about building sustainable, durable revenue over time. First, you bring in the clients and the participants. We've seen the participants grow. Then you bring in the assets. We've seen the assets grow. That then comes into the brokerage accounts, which eventually moves into the advice-based accounts, and we continue to see great trends in the advice-driven model in fee-based assets and the asset management revenues. The asset management revenues, Mike, are at a record high, so I would just highlight that as well as proof point that this model is working.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAnd then just one follow-up for Ted. Ted, I think your outlook for the industry capital markets was about as bullish as we've heard yet. I think you used the word potpourri, IPOs in the Valley, cross-border by sector, financial sponsor, Japan highest in years, event financing. Specifically, what are your backlogs? How do they compare with last quarter? And just one more time, the level of your conviction that this time is for real, because there's been a lot of false starts the last two years. Thanks.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I think it's a reasonable question. The backlogs are all up. I think it will be a slow march back. People are not going to jump into some of the speculative paper that we saw during the SPAC period, clearly, but the receptivity to recent IPOs that were high quality was quite impressive, quite broad interest among investors.\nThe need to execute on cross-border M&A is here. It's, for many companies, an existential reality. Their supply chains have been disrupted by two major global conflicts, and they need to nearshore and make the trade-off, which means they need to potentially bolt on pieces of supply chain that's in front of them. They may need to take regulatory risk. There may need to be structuring and financing advice around that, so-called solutions where we think we're strong. The other motivating piece, Mike, is, and I do think there's going to be growing consensus on this, the financial sponsor community is sitting on a product that has a three, four, five-year life as a private company ready to come out one way or the other, either through a public offering or to be sold in the private markets.\nThat is the best way for the financial sponsor community to return capital to their LPs and keep the thing going with raising ever bigger funds. So there will be a competitive dynamic, I believe, between the financial sponsor and corporate community with respect to assets that are available, whether they are public or private, in order to continue to create value for their LPs or shareholders. The fact that the US economy continues to grow, that China is weaker, that parts of Europe are weaker, highlights the fact that people indeed want to get even more exposure to the US. With respect to Japan, what's interesting there is most of our client base are both buyers and sellers of assets, which is to say they're sitting on enormous yen-denominated deposits, but they wish to grow the economy.\nSo that is a market, obviously, where we're active, and the financial sponsor and corporate communities, both in and out, will continue to be. So I am quite bullish about the full investment bank capability for those that have a global reach. It could take several years and have some lumpiness along the way, but I think the next three, four, five years will be quite active.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Dan.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Hoping you could provide an update on overall client cash levels within wealth and how you think about the revenue opportunity as that cash is eventually redeployed.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. So we did see the percentage of client cash. So we've given you, I think, 22% in the advisory channel is now down to, say, 21%, 20% levels depending on what channels that you're looking at.\nBut that, I would say, is not a function of the actual cash levels coming down, but rather that the equity markets have risen. So just to be clear in terms of the actual mix. The reason I bring up those percentages is they're still high relative to the pre-COVID historical levels of, say, 17%, 18% that we've given on previous calls. So there is still room to see the deployment of cash over time into the markets.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood. And as a follow-up, in the release, you mentioned about half of the flows came from your family office offering. Not sure we've heard that stat before, or I was hoping you could provide some context in terms of the size of that business for you.\nAnd then also just the mix of flows more broadly in terms of the channels, if you could provide a few more specifics in terms of the percentage breakdown?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nAbsolutely. I'm so glad you asked as it relates to the family office offering because we have been talking about it for some time. We launched and we really formally enhanced our family office offering in 2021. We discussed it on some of our earnings calls as a place where you could begin to see the integrated firm. And by that, I mean a way to offer our wealth management clients different solutions from institutional securities. So our fund management products where you're actually able to look at your portfolio from a more integrated basis the way that you would as an institutional client.\nAs we begin to offer new solutions to our clients, these are more ways to get touch points and deepen different client relationships and bring them on board. So this is an example of that. The reason we point it out is also to highlight to you that there are lumpy flows that come through these channels. And so when we say these flows can be lumpy, there are different sales channels across the offering, and those different channels have different sales cycles. And so therefore, you will see ins and outs of various pieces of N&A over time. But in this particular quarter and over the long-term history, we have seen a very diversified set of channels. We have the workplace. We obviously have the advice-based relationship, different pieces of stock plan, etc., that come in through the channel, and there is diversification there.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah.\nWhat I'd add to that is, to Sharon's point on integrated firm, we have this. Sharon made reference to this gem of a business that we have in the institutional equities division called Fund Services, which caters to alternative asset managers and effectively does their documentation work and effectively all of the release to their LPs. The question that has been asked over the last number of years is, when some of these folks go on to open their family office and manage their own wealth, what about having a product that has the feel of an institutional product from when they were running their asset manager for their family office or for a related business?\nSo the folks in Fund Services got together with the folks in wealth management who run our outsourced CIO product, and they effectively came up with a mousetrap that gives the look of an institutional product for folks who are very much in the ultra-high net worth category. This helps work towards a piece of the wealth bracket that we've all been focused on over the last number of years, which is the very high net worth space, which is very competitive. But in bringing together some of the capability and kit from the equities business over to the wealth business and have them work together with the founder in her next life managing a family office, it's actually a nice, seamless way to keep the funds in-house and to deliver institutional-style capability to clients.\nSo this is something we are putting our foot on the accelerator on and is a great example of our equities division and the wealth management folks working hand in glove to deliver something for clients.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Devin.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nDirector of Financial Technology Research, Citizens JMP\n\nGreat. Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon. Question just on trading. Obviously, results have just been incredibly resilient at a high level. And I know you all have spoken about both market share opportunities for Morgan Stanley, but then there's still this kind of expansion of the overall industry wallet. And so I'd love to maybe just hit on that second point. And when you think about that wallet opportunity, the expansion of the wallet, what are some of the biggest opportunities in kind of the growth algorithms?\nI think a lot of us are sitting here saying, \"Results have been phenomenal. How can they continue to improve from here?\"\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Sure. I'll take that. When you think about the expansion of the wallet and consider where we came from and where we are now, as more and more of the corporations and coverage of the corporations is becoming more integrated, there are many solutions that a bank such as ourselves can offer, be that from a global perspective. If you think about where rates are as just a tangible example, interest rate hedging that you can offer corporations as they think about transactions. There are different types of foreign exchange transactions that you could think about when you're looking at M&A or you're looking at other corporate deals that you have to do in-house for a global franchise.\nSo there are corporate solutions that we expect to see growth in from a wallet perspective. And there's also financing where you have different types of markets and channels that are growing, private credit being an example, where financing different assets by different types of sponsors are places where we could see opportunities for a wallet share growth more broadly.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd what I would add to that is we're in the middle of the PE ecosystem with respect to M&A financing risk. If you ask a number of the asset managers, both real money and alternative asset managers, they would say we are a partner of choice. So opportunity exists within credit, where there's a big focus on the financing side. It's obviously stable revenue.\nAnd we're getting after some of the opportunities that lie across fixed income and inside of our new issue business to originate, structure, finance credit, of course, a focus on private credit, and then in equities to continue to expand our prime brokerage capability and to build out derivatives. So this ecosystem around the financial sponsors who know our firm very well with all of the integrated firm capability, this is a space and a client base that we are focused on along with, of course, our leading strategic clients on the corporate side.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nDirector of Financial Technology Research, Citizens JMP\n\nOkay. Terrific. Thanks. And then a follow-up just on the debt capital markets outlook, obviously very strong quarter. We have heard a little bit about maybe some pull forward just on the year in terms of people front-loading.\nAnd so I just want to get a sense of whether you feel like that may play out as well for Morgan Stanley. And then when you think about the pipeline for debt underwriting, I appreciate that deals come together quickly, so there's maybe not as much of a formal pipeline. But is the tone there similarly strong is what you're seeing for M&A and equity underwriting? And also appreciate there's probably some interconnectivity there as well. Thank you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. I would point you to, as you said, there is interconnectivity. Remember that I think many of the peers have also mentioned there could have been some pull forward that you saw. It's also been a market that's been open over the course of the last two years.\nSo I wouldn't draw these same parallels that you might have seen in M&A or in equity where you had a real dearth of activity the last two years. But rather, that market, especially in IG, has been relatively open. When you think about high yield and other non-IG kinds of concepts, and of course, there are the event-related transactions. But from an IG market, that market's been well open over the last two years.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Good morning, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGood morning, Ted. Thank you for taking the call. Ted, you had some very encouraging comments on the outlook for the capital markets, which is great. Question for you. You mentioned about the high yield and leveraged loan market. You're starting to see event financing, which is good.\nHow is the competition from the private credit side? Because they have made inroads, obviously, in the last couple of years. Are you guys seeing that the traditional investment banks are getting some of that market share back?\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThe competition is real, and we all need to adapt to stay relevant in the ecosystem. I think there's going to be room for folks in the private space to participate in deals, but I certainly do not believe, as some seem to suggest, that the global investment banks will not have a large role to play as underwriters of securities and all the benefits that that brings to the issuer versus someone issuing private credit and potentially being the owner over time if things don't go well.\nSo I think we're in a world where the ecosystem will at times have many of the players acting as partners, sometimes will act as counterparties, and at times even competitors. But I think the ecosystem has more than enough room on a global basis for both the emerging private credit space, but also the incumbents to continue to be able to do their thing.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nVery good. And just as a quick follow-up to that, once again, your outlook is very encouraging. 10 years up again today, there's talk of it moving even higher. The front end of the curve, there's talk about higher for longer. If we get into a really higher for longer rate environment, does that kind of weigh on some of the optimism of the outlook that you presented today? Or no, it doesn't really have a material impact on it? Thank you.\n\nTed Pick\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, it's a great question. It depends on whether rates are higher because they are sustaining continued growth in the US or if they are higher for a period of time and are followed by a tough landing, in which case we're in recession, and clearly then things will slow down. I think our view is that the US economy continues to progress quite nicely, that balance sheets amongst our client base are quite strong on the institutional side and on the wealth side, and that there is plenty to do, and that the higher rates that we see are in part, if not more than in part, dictated by a view that we continue to have some inflation and that the economy is in healthy shape and maybe asynchronously relative to other places in the world. But that again speaks to US strength.\nAnd as you know, first and foremost, we have our activity based in the US. But over time, there will be strength in places again like Japan and in Europe, and then eventually in the China complex where we will be busy too. So my bullishness is not a mark-to-market on any given week or month. It's a view that corporate boardrooms have been quiet for three, four years, and that is not sustainable. They need to move. They were ready to move before the pandemic. Then the pandemic came, and then there were higher rates. Those higher rates seem to be well absorbed. Yes, now we need to have models that factor in appropriate cost of capital as we saw in prior regimes where cost of capital mattered.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nNow we're in a period that comes after financial repression where we'll have some inflation and some real rates, and companies and financial sponsors will adapt, and the strong companies will prosper. We are setting up for that, and we believe will be a multi-year cycle. I would say finally that what we're most excited about, of course, is the model that we are working with both the institutional community, but also our wealth management clients to adapt and to optimize as we move into the next cycle.\nThere are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Please enter your passcode followed by the pound or hash key. Thank you. Your passcode is confirmed. Please wait while you are joined to the event.\nThank you for joining the Morgan Stanley Earnings Conference. Please continue to stand by as we will be going live shortly.\nGood morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic updates.

The reconciliations of these non-GAAP-adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. It is a privilege to be with you. Today, I will deliver the annual deck that was a hallmark of James Gorman's 14-year tenure, both to affirm Morgan Stanley's strategy and to provide a level of transparency on our progress that you have come to respect. Let's turn to the slides, turning first to slide three. Over the last 15 years, we have transformed the firm's business mix, scale, profitability, and returns. If you compare various historical periods, you can see our business evolution. Each period faced its own challenges. In 2009 to 2014, Morgan Stanley was a classic self-help story. The transformation began with the acquisition and integration of Smith Barney. The investment bank was reset, and the firm survived the near-triple credit downgrade and the euro crisis.\nIn 2015 to 2019, we weathered the years of financial repression, resizing our fixed-income business and pressing ahead with the top slot in institutional equities. During this period, we also acquired Solium, which was a step toward leadership in the corporate stock plan space. Then, in 2020 to 2022, the COVID years, we achieved incremental scale in both wealth and investment management with the acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, giving us a leading self-directed platform and pushing forward in investment solutions. During this period, each of the two major business lines, wealth and investment management and institutional securities, generated operating leverage and high returns. The transformed Morgan Stanley of today has tripled client assets in its durable businesses with significant opportunities for further growth. Notwithstanding 2023's geopolitical, macroeconomic, and industry challenges, the firm's business model generated consistent results.\nIn 2023, firm revenues were $54 billion with $12 billion of PBT, double the averages of 2009 to 2014. Our return on tangible common equity was a solid 13%, inclusive of notable items that reduced returns by over 100 basis points. Last year's return profile was triple the post-crisis years. Combined earnings from wealth and investment management generated 60% of the firm's top line and PBT, and our category of one asset gathering strategy sets the stage for continued durable growth. The institutional securities business also grew over the transformation years with an eye to investing in its leading franchises. The objective has been to create an integrated investment bank of investment banking, equities, and fixed income to serve leading institutions around the world. Taken together, the Morgan Stanley business portfolio of today has well higher and more stable profitability.\nThe actions we've taken over the last 15 years, organic and inorganic, were all within our core strategic footprint. At its center is acting as a trusted advisor to clients, helping them raise, allocate, and manage capital. It is what we do. We are a global leader, and we are really good at it. This will not change. Turning to slide four. Since 2010, revenues in wealth and investment management have more than doubled, and today, we're number one in the world among our peers. During the same period, our client assets have more than tripled to $6.6 trillion. We see continued opportunities to drive growth and are steadfast in our goal of reaching $10 trillion in total client assets. In Wealth Management, we have established ourselves as a leading asset gatherer by expanding our business model across three channels: advisor-led, self-directed, and workplace.\nThe business generated a trillion of net new assets over the past three years, and we are relentlessly focused on sustainable growth. We expect NNA growth to continue to vary quarter by quarter given seasonality and even year to year given market tone and the cadence of migrating Workplace assets and attracting assets held away. We are nevertheless confident in our ability to continue to grow and deepen our 18 million relationships with the breadth of our Wealth Management offering. Over time, our ability to attract, deepen, and retain client relationships with our differentiated platform allows us to drive revenue growth and operating leverage, enabling 30% margins. Given some of the recent macro headwinds and our continued investments for growth, it's reasonable to expect reported margins to consolidate in the mid-20s range over the near term.\nThe underlying business has achieved 30% margins before, and we intend to deliver that return profile again in the long term against a higher base of revenue. Our wealth platform is complemented by investment management, where we've added a number of new capabilities to our strong public market alpha engines. This business is well aligned to key areas where we see secular growth, including customization such as Parametric, Private Markets, and value-add credit. At a holistic level, the wealth and investment management business has achieved the kind of scale which enables us to invest in what matters most to clients and to take further market share through cycles. Turning to slide five. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities Group, our integrated investment bank, is a preeminent global franchise.\nOur capability set, extensive client footprint, and premier brand put us in a position to be the trusted advisor to every important corporation, public or private, asset manager, and asset owner. Our teams across geographies, businesses, and client segments position us at the center of global capital allocation and formation. Over the last decade, we have advised on nearly $9 trillion in M&A transactions, raised nearly $13 trillion of capital for clients, and as indication of our markets presence, in a single trading session last month, our equities business transacted roughly $250 billion of notional value. Our leadership position outside the US, acting as a true global investment bank, is critical to the Morgan Stanley franchise.\nAfter more than five years managing our integrated investment bank, I'd add that it is clear from client visits around the world that the barriers to entry to becoming a global investment bank are real. Today, there are fewer competitors, and we are one of those very few who can provide the full breadth of capabilities. We expect the next economic and financial cycle to be led by corporate finance activity, which will drive investment banking growth, and as such, are particularly focused on expanding our 15% wallet share in that advice-driven business. Turning to slide six. When you combine our wealth and investment management platform with our leading institutional franchise, you see the power of what we will call the integrated firm. Our capacity to source new client opportunities, efficiently facilitate the flow of capital, and deliver Morgan Stanley firm-wide solutions has never been stronger.\nLooking at the right side of the slide, more specifically, our premier corporate franchise spans every business segment, with clients at the center of everything we do. We cover their broad range of needs, from advising the C-suite on strategy to helping them raise capital and hedge risks, on through to advising a broader employee base through our workplace offering. Second, we have a unique capability to serve individuals who range from self-directed up through to the ultra-high net worth set and small institutions who sit between the traditional segments. We can deliver best-in-class institutional capabilities paired with sophisticated wealth management solutions in an integrated service model. Third, we continue to invest in our ability to deliver investment and client solutions as we are at the center of financial innovation and growth.\nOur global integrated investment bank is core to our ability to source and structure customized opportunities for corporations and financial sponsors. Our structuring capabilities are augmented by scale distribution channels, extending from the largest institutions through the individual retail client set. With a central focus on our clients, we see significant opportunities in delivering the integrated firm. Turning to slide seven. Ultimately, the firm's success relies on our human capital and maintaining a differentiated partnership culture. With James as Executive Chairman and together with Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz as our co-presidents, our highest priority is delivering the integrated firm to our clients. Our shared Morgan Stanley experience, having all lived through the 15-year transformation, gives us a lens into where we come from and where we are going. Intentional mobility of our leadership, engineered by James over these many years, is particularly important.\nAndy, in his expanded role as head of both wealth and investment management, is well situated to leverage his deep knowledge of retail distribution and products to drive client opportunities across the business. Dan, having successfully revitalized investment management for nearly a decade, is returning to lead institutional securities, where he spent 25 years, and will play a critical role in connecting the firm around sourcing opportunities, structuring financing, and distributing capital for our clients. Both these gentlemen have burnished the brand and successfully integrated acquisitions. To have James, Dan, and Andy as partners to open 2024 speaks to the enduring strength of our culture. Our broader leadership team has worked together since the financial crisis through the strategic transformation and today are unified in advancing toward our goals. The operating and management committees of the firm each have an average tenure of more than 20 years.\nLong tenure is one element that maintains the strength of a learning culture of serving clients in a first-class way. In addition to backing the Morgan Stanley experience set of our longstanding leaders, we're enhanced by the injection of some key lateral hires and joiners via our acquisitions. Our businesses are supported by world-class technology and infrastructure organization and by 2,320 talented managing directors, 155 of whom we promoted to the partnership last week. Our 80,000 people are what makes Morgan Stanley's culture and drives us to be excellent on behalf of our clients, to be prudent fiduciaries of capital, and to maintain a keen awareness of the road we have traveled to achieve the firm we have today. Turning to slide eight.\nIn addition to one, the performance of the business, two, driving the integrated firm, and three, maintaining our culture, we are also highly focused on the state of our financial capital. Given our deliberate growth and durable earnings over the last several years, our capital position is strong going into the finalization of Basel III Endgame. Our regulatory requirements, as measured within our Stress Capital Buffer, have steadily come down since 2020, reflecting the improved resilience of our businesses. With respect to Basel III Endgame, we continue to believe, after fulsome industry comments and further evaluation of economic and competitive impacts, that the final rule will result in a much more constructive outcome than originally proposed, particularly as it pertains to matters that are driving our estimated RWA inflation. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the dividend, as it is at the core of our business model's durability.\nWhile we will toggle among opportunities to support our clients, grow our businesses, and repurchase our stock, the core strengths and strategic decisions of the last 15 years are reflected in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown from $0.05 to 0.85 per share. The continued sustainability of that dividend is paramount. With the firm coming together, we will drive toward our performance goals. Slide nine reiterates our confidence in them. Our strategy and long-term value proposition remain intact. The four firm-wide goals are in place, hitting $10 trillion in client assets, achieving a 30% wealth management pre-tax margin, a 70% firm-wide efficiency ratio, and achieving 20% returns on tangible equity. Our management team is steeled to execute against our priorities to reach these goals. We entered 2024 with confidence, and our base case for the coming year is constructive. There are two major downside risks.\nThe first is geopolitical, that global conflicts intensify and conflagrate. The second is the state of the US economy over the course of 2024. The base case is benign, namely that of a soft landing. But if the economy weakens dramatically in the quarters to come and the Fed has to move rapidly to avoid a hard landing, that would likely result in lower asset prices and activity levels. On the other hand, if inflation, in fact, has not been beaten back and continues to challenge consumers and the supply chain, that could result in a stickier Fed, and the resulting higher-for-longer will have to be absorbed in the way of a higher-than-expected cost of capital and the dangers of a bifurcated economy. These risks, the geopolitical and that of the US economy, present some uncertainties as we start 2024.\nNevertheless, as we have discussed this morning, the Morgan Stanley of today is meant to perform through the cycle. Based on the evidence we see, our building M&A and IPO pipelines, improving boardroom confidence, and an increasingly positive tone from our retail and institutional clients, we remain constructive on the year ahead. We will execute on our clear and consistent strategy. We have a global business, a world-class wealth and investment manager alongside a leading investment bank. The growth opportunities are extraordinary, especially given how our businesses and regions intersect and support the business strategy. We will continue to lead with asset consolidation across wealth and investment management and remain committed to growing high-quality share in institutional securities to consistently deliver our integrated firm to clients around the world. In so doing, we will continue to execute towards our key objectives and to deliver for shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sharon. We'll discuss our fourth quarter and annual results, and then together, we'll take your questions. Thank you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $54.1 billion in 2023 and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of $12.9 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 12.8%, and EPS was $5.18. For the fourth quarter, ROTCE was 8.4%, and EPS was $0.85. The full year efficiency ratio was 77.2%. A number of factors impacted our annual and quarterly results. The full year results include nearly $900 million of notable items. Over half of these items were reflected in the fourth quarter. A $286 million FDIC special assessment charge and a legal settlement of $249 million were both realized in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, the full year results include $353 million of severance expenses, primarily related to a May employee action. The combination of these three items negatively impacted full year EPS by $0.44, ROTCE by 105 basis points, and the efficiency ratio by 164 basis points. Total integration-related expenses for the year were $293 million, nearly 70% of which was related to E*TRADE. With the E*TRADE integration now complete, we remain focused on continuing to manage our expense base, supporting our long-term efficiency goals while still investing in growth. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues were $23.1 billion, and quarterly revenues were $4.9 billion. Full year results were impacted by the weak investment banking environment that began with the onset of the hiking cycle and geopolitical events in early 2022 and persisted through most of the past year.\nFourth quarter revenues reflected stronger investment banking results and prudent risk management across fixed income and equities. Investment banking revenues were $4.6 billion for the full year. Lower completed M&A transactions followed a dearth of announcements in the back half of 2022 and early 2023, which weighed on results. However, optimism began to rise mid-year, followed by a notable increase in Morgan Stanley's announced volumes starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. Results were supported mostly by fixed income underwriting, as the investment-grade market remained open for regular way issuance and was supported by event-driven activity. Advisory revenues have begun to recover versus recent quarters and were roughly flat year-over-year. Equity underwriting revenues were also flat, as activity remained muted. As we enter 2024, we are positioned to capitalize on the opportunity set.\nWhile downside risks are linked to the consumer with the rate path and geopolitics as two key determinants, we expect the US will lead the recovery globally. Corporate confidence will ultimately drive the cycle forward, and we are encouraged by signs that the CEO and boardroom optimism is growing, evidenced by the build of our advisory and IPO pipelines. Our integrated investment bank is well positioned to capitalize on the recovering backdrop, particularly where the institution works across the businesses with CEOs, CFOs, and treasurers on corporate solutions. Strength and sentiment should support broad M&A and new capital market issuance and eventually feed through to the broader market activity. Equity full year revenues were $10 billion, reflecting lower revenues across regions. Tempered client engagement was reflective of broad market uncertainty. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Prime brokerage revenues in the fourth quarter were solid.\nResults reflected narrower spreads and the geographic mix of client balances. Cash results declined versus last year's fourth quarter, reflecting lower volumes, particularly in Asia ex-Japan. Derivative results were up versus last year's fourth quarter as the business continued to grow the client base. Fixed income revenues were $7.7 billion for the full year, declining from 2022's strong result. The full year decline was driven by lower client activity in foreign exchange and commodities, which were impacted by greater uncertainty around the rate outlook and less volatile energy markets. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance was down versus the prior fourth quarter. Results reflected fewer monetization opportunities, particularly in Asia, compared to heightened engagement in the region last year. Micro is down year-over-year, driven by lower revenues in credit corporates, which was negatively impacted by movements in credit spreads on the back of geopolitical events.\nResults in commodities were up versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting improved performance in the power and gas business. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management's revenues were $26.3 billion, and the pre-tax profit was $6.5 billion, which resulted in a PBT margin of 24.9%. Reported results reflect the complex macro backdrop as well as several idiosyncratic events. The unprecedented rise in the absolute level of interest rates was particularly consequential, as the subsequent shifts in client behavior impacted the revenue mix and margin. In addition, there were several expense items that impacted the margin, including integration-related expenses, the FDIC special assessment, severance charges, and the impact of DCP, which saw meaningful swings compared to last year. Taken together, these four items impacted the full year margin by over 250 basis points.\nTotal client assets ended the year at a new high, reaching $5.1 trillion of assets. Full year fee-based flows were $109 billion. These flows and associated fees offset the market levels and changes in interest mix of client portfolios, supporting the year-over-year increase in asset management revenues. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, and the reported PBT margin was 21.5%. The aforementioned notable expenses negatively impacted the fourth quarter margin by over 400 basis points. Asset management revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, up approximately $200 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. Quarterly fee-based flows were strong at $42 billion, underscoring the value clients are seeing in our advice-based model. Client allocations to higher-yielding cash alternatives remained elevated, and clients continue to deploy monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances.\nThe eventual return of the new issuance calendar and improved retail sentiment should provide a tailwind as clients look to redeploy into broader asset classes. Net new assets of $282 billion for the year represented 7% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $47 billion. For the full year, net new asset growth was driven by the advisor-led channel across existing clients, new clients, and net recruiting. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues increased slightly year-over-year as clients invested in structured products and fixed income products. Bank lending balances of $147 billion remained roughly flat, consistent with the environment. Total deposits increased 2% quarter-over-quarter to $346 billion, driven by continued demand for our savings offering from our wealth management channel and a modest increase in sweep balances.\nNet interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the mix of average deposits and the blended deposit cost in the quarter. Looking ahead to Q1 2024, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of net interest income. The modest sequential build and sweeps was promising and suggests we are nearing a level of frictional sweeps in client accounts. Assuming that the forward curve holds and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the first quarter to be roughly in line with Q4. Our asset-led gathering strategy remains unchanged, and we expect it to deliver margin expansion over time. The path is clear and includes the following objectives. First, increase relationships through our channels. Second, migrate assets to advice.\nThird, deepen existing client relationships with enhanced capabilities, including new products and solutions, and finally, realize scale benefits of our investments over time. These efforts are well underway. In the year, we grew client relationships by over 600,000 across the franchise. This was led by success in the workplace channel as we continue to win corporate plans and add participants in stock plans. In the prior three years, we saw an average of $50 billion of workplace assets migrate to the advisor-led channel on an annual basis. This year, client migration was up 25% year-over-year despite economic headwinds. And on the product side, our financial advisors are offering clients investment opportunities such as private credit, private equity, and all their other alternatives. Bringing wealth and investment management closer together will create greater opportunities for ongoing product creation.\nAs we move forward and transition from integration to optimization for client experience, we expect to see greater scale benefits from our investments over time. Investment Management reported full year results of $5.4 billion and fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion. AUM increased year-over-year to $1.5 trillion, supported by higher asset values. Long-term net inflows of approximately $7 billion, excuse me, long-term net outflows of approximately $7 billion, were driven by headwinds in our MSIM active equity growth strategies. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for Parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies as more retail clients seek customized solutions. Liquidity overlay services had outflows of $6.6 billion. Weaker institutional liquidity flows were partially offset by demand for Parametric's overlay product.\nThe combined Parametric brand, inclusive of overlay and its retail offering, had net inflows of over $5 billion again this quarter, underscoring the strength of our differentiated customized offering. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees of $1.4 billion increased slightly versus last year. Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $61 million. Gains in US private equity, and infrastructure offset losses in real estate, reflecting the benefits of diversification in the franchise. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased by $13 billion sequentially to $457 billion as we actively supported clients. We prudently managed our capital profile and ended the year with a standardized CET1 ratio of 15.2% while focusing on our strategic priorities, including our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.\nUtilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization, we were opportunistic at the start of the fourth quarter, and we bought back $1.3 billion of common stock. The full year tax rate was 21.9%, reflecting the realization of certain tax benefits earlier in the year. The fourth quarter's tax rate was 26.5%, primarily reflecting the tax implications of a specific legal matter. We expect the 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, consistent with prior years. We continue to expect some quarterly volatility. A number of idiosyncratic and macro headwinds added complexity to the backdrop over the last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we ended the year better than where we started. We now have $6.6 trillion of client assets, and we successfully completed our E*TRADE integration. As it relates to capital markets, boardroom confidence is rising, and our calendar is building.\nWe approach 2024 with optimism, keenly aware of the dynamic environment we operate in as we continue to drive towards our performance goals. With that, we will now open the lineup to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are now ready to take in questions. To get in the queue, you may press star and the number one on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star and the number two on your touch-tone telephone. You're allowed to ask one question and one follow-up, and then we'll move to the next person in the queue. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Oh, it looks like we've lost Dan. We'll move to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nHi, thanks very much. So Sharon, I love how you've laid out the picture on, on the wealth management margin potential. So my, my question, and I do like that sweeps have settled in. So I'm, I'm curious, in the big picture, has FA and client behavior changed a bunch on, on the cash management front such that that's a potential driver of margin potential and why you're, you know, you know, leaning towards that mid-20s near-term versus the 30% where we were kind of hanging out when rates were lower and deposits were higher? Is that the primary driver of the margin thought? And do you think behavior's changed, like, permanently?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo I can't speak to behavior permanently, but I appreciate the question, Glenn. If we take a step back, it was always an idea, the premise of a sustainable growth in margin was really about ensuring that we continue to see growth in fee-based assets and we see growth in that migration towards the advice-based channel. And in fact, that is what you've begun to see. Look at our fee-based flows this quarter alone and think about the fee-based flows that we've had over the course of the year. We continue to educate our clients. So when we think through the funnel, we have more participants, we begin to see more assets, and then those assets will, over time, migrate to advice. What you point out as we think about the cash and what some might call cash sorting, etc., is that we still have that 22% to 23% sitting in cash equivalents.\nSo not necessarily BDP, but rather cash equivalents that don't necessarily earn a fee, right? Money markets, think of a savings product over time, etc., that you might see. As individuals begin to take that money and deploy it into markets or deploy it into fee-based, that will be accretive to the margin over time. And that, to your point, is a place where you should begin to see a margin build and something that becomes more sustainable as we both grow our asset base and grow the advice and the client migration towards advice in those fee-based assets.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nMakes sense. I appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up in wealth, if I could. It certainly doesn't show in your flows this quarter, so I guess I know where you're going to go with this. But you're definitely hearing a lot more from the bank-owned wealth management companies that are turning up the heat a little bit on recruiting and a lot more on their intent to better penetrate their banking wallet, client's wallet. So I'm, I'm curious if you feel any of that, in your franchise, any of that in where you compete and whether or not that impacts your, your thought process on your ability to attract some of the trillions of dollars held away that is always part of the growth story?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo the first point I would say is it's obviously always a competitive market, but we're very well positioned given the tools that we've given to our advisors. A couple of points that I would make to you. The first is when we look forward into the first quarter, that recruiting pipeline is healthy.\nSo when we think about January and what we're seeing, we see the recruiting being healthy. The second point that I'd mention is what I find to be most encouraging: when you look under the NNA data, we're seeing new clients come to Morgan Stanley. So it's not just attracting assets held away, but rather you're actually getting new clients from those participants, and then you're seeing conversion. So when you think about some of the statistics that I gave you around workplace, and we've talked about these statistics, the workplace assets that move over: you have 80% of those assets are actually assets that are coming from outside the institution. So you're bringing new clients in, and then they're bringing their assets that are sitting away into the institution. So I think we're well positioned to capture those opportunities.\nFinal point that I'd make is on your banking products. Actually, this idea of the E*TRADE integration, right? And we talked about we've completed the integration, and I said we're looking towards the forward of the front office integration. Some of that will be around banking products, etc., as we think and we look ahead over a multi-year journey.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Congrats on the new role, Ted. I was hoping you could elaborate on the current environment, and a little bit more, and maybe what you see as the biggest opportunities for growth as you look to make progress against the longer-term targets that you've outlined.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for your question. I think, we, as you heard from my comments, are generally constructive about what 2024 brings, and it should be beneficial to both arms of the firm. Some of the reorientation of cash equivalents, whether they be in money markets or treasuries and the like, that Sharon referred to, and redeploy by our wealth clients into the markets, given increasing sense of stability, clearly good for FAs and for the wealth channel. In the investment bank, we've had a decades-long drought in IPOs, the slowest volume we've seen in decades. And as you know, we've had very, very light M&A calendars, so that also has been at a trough, sort of early cycle type activity from our highest margin products inside of the investment bank, specifically inside of investment banking, we think, in order to our benefit too.\nSo, we quite possibly could have a dynamic where, if we are in this soft landing zone, we could see increased activity. You know, ultimately we are in the tickets business, activity based, in both channels, and benign economic conditions augur well for both wealth and investment, but also for the investment bank. And part of the reason I wanted to talk about the integrated firm today was because the two segments, working together, will bring inevitably additional growth opportunities inside the firm. We have folks that have mobilized around the enterprise and are now in a position to talk to clients across the product spectrum and to bring in additional business. We have a big business, as you know, in Europe and in Asia.\nSo if economic conditions are better than the expected, which is that Europe will struggle and China might as well, if we do any better than that, we would expect to see some increased activity coming out of those regions too. So it's not just a US proposition, but a global one as well.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you. And you mentioned margins and within the wealth channel or wealth segment will consolidate around the mid-20s here in the near term. Can you maybe unpack some of the inputs that will drive that outcome?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nCertainly. I worked through that, I think, Dan, when I actually tried to explain it in the script. So the premise in terms of a growing wealth management margin, again, is about the conversion to the advice-based model over time. Of course, individuals will have different pieces, right?\nBut we have three different channels that we've talked about. We've talked about self-directed, we've talked about workplace, we've talked about advice. The self-directed side, we will continue to attract those clients, and those that might be interested in advice will see it as we have different ways to give people a sense and a, a connection to FAs. So we've talked about that. On the workplace side, we continue to get new participants, new corporate relationships, and that, as we educate people with the wellness offering, etc., and we've seen evidence of this to bring people yet again to that advice-driven model. The fee-based flows, as you see those, those will help us grow the asset management line. You can break it down again, the transactional line.\nWe've talked about you're going to have new products, and you're going to have a deployment of this cash that's been sitting on the sidelines that we've talked a lot about, the dry powder. That could impact either the transactional line or the asset management line. And again, we're encouraged by the signs that we're seeing in NII. That too suggests that we are seeing, as of right now, it looks like that cash, that frictional level of cash is stabilizing. So I think you have the drivers in each of those lines as we think about the revenue side. And then as you think about the expense side, those we are looking for a place to invest and gain from the scale of those investments. And that will be as part of the objectives that Ted laid out when you see $10 trillion of assets.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, and welcome, Ted. Maybe just going back to the strategic update going to slide 13 where you sort of lay out very nicely the transformation over the last 15 years. As we look forward over the next three to five years, I was wondering if you can help fill in the blanks around strategically, I mean, M&A seem has been a key pillar of this transformation. As we think about both organic and inorganic, one on the M&A side, give us a sense of just where you see deal-making happening over the next few years. We saw a big private asset deal now being announced on Friday, so we'd love some perspective there.\nAnd then I think the second thing you mentioned in terms of wallet share, on the investment banking side, if we can unpack that a little bit in terms of how you expect to achieve a greater wallet share. Thank you.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good to talk with you. It's an interesting question. You're effectively asking what the slide will look like three, four years from now. We believe that the revenue mix will toggle around. There could be periods like in 2020 or 2021 where the investment bank is really firing on all cylinders, again, early economy type of activity, and that could grow again towards 50%. And we could have other periods where, as we continue to invest in the wealth and investment management piece of the firm, that could expand further.\nI think where we are right now is a revenue and profitability matter where 60% of the firm is in Wealth and Investment Management is not a bad place to start. I think the main message I'd want to convey today is that while there's a change in leadership after 14 years of James's stewardship, there's not a change in strategy. We have undertaken and integrated, if you really go back into time, and then include Mesa West, five different acquisitions. I think the view inside the house is that's good for now. You know, we can execute our business with the growth plans in front of us, and it feels organic. Now, that having been said, there are ideas that come across the transom, and we naturally would take a look.\nBut I think for the next period, the view that I would have is that we really work to grow the organization and to do so organically and efficiently. I think on the margin, one comment might be that we could work on sweating the income statement a bit more. There's a little more work to be done post-integration on where there could be inefficiencies along the income statement. And I think we are much focused on looking for those efficiencies without giving up any of the strategic investment that we want to make on our way to 30% PBT margins in wealth and 70% efficiency of the firm.\nThe way I've articulated the strategic goals is to effectively reiterate we will achieve those goals, but along the way, we will invest, and that investment opportunity exists on the current portfolio in an exciting way. That is why, for me, the most important message we wanted to send out to folks today was this concept of the integrated firm. Now we have the portfolio of businesses together. We have a unified partnership culture. We have the two halves of the firm. It'll toggle by five or 10 points on revenue or profitability given a period of time. But now we can scale that organically and hit the numbers and work the income statement a little bit.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, good morning. So, wanted to start off, Ted and Sharon, with just a question on incremental margins and comp leverage in a lower rate backdrop. We know NII is going to be a source of drag in the coming quarter, certainly if the forward curve manifests, but fees should see improved momentum from equity market tailwinds, stronger fee-based flows, and a better IB backdrop. But the street is modeling comp dollars flat, revenues up about $2 billion. I'm just trying to get a sense as to how we should think about incremental margins as revenue momentum improves, but the growth is coming admittedly from more compensable areas.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo, you obviously did hit the nail on the head in terms of the different pieces, right? So you can't, you can't look at the different line items the same way.\nYou're going to have a comp ratio change, as FAs get compensated, as you would expect, on the grid associated with those fee-based revenues. As it relates to NII, yes, that was non-compensable, as I just told you. The expectation on a quarter-over-quarter basis, if client behavior remains unchanged, you are sitting in a position where you're beginning to better understand what that behavior is, and that NII will be roughly in line with where it was in the fourth quarter, at least for the first quarter. And so, yes, the comp itself might change, but the actual growth in the ability to see the fee-based assets grow is higher. There are also other offsetting factors that we have to think about as we look back into the last year.\nRemember that what I highlighted was you had negative implications associated with mix of revenue in those asset management lines because of the fact that we saw investors invest in, say, fixed income products. You had market dynamics associated with billing, etc. So there is place; there are rather places that you can see growth in the asset management line. Yes, they will be compressible, but we would see benefits of scale both from the asset side and, hopefully from the market side as you cited, you see different pieces being invested as you move forward. I hope that helps to, to frame the answer to your question.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nNo, that's actually helpful. And just for my follow-up, I was hoping you could just speak to the sensitivity to lower rates. It's a big area of focus for investors. You benefit from having the majority of your deposits in premium savings where admittedly you have greater pricing flexibility. At the same time, the asset side is still very sensitive to the short end. So I want to get a sense as to how you expect the NII trajectory to unfold, as the Fed begins easing, and whether there's any appetite on your side to extend duration to maybe lock in some higher yields.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's a great question, and the answer is fully premised on what we see first with deposits, right? So your sort of first order condition as you look ahead into 2024 is what happens to the deposit mix. What I said on the call is that we're encouraged, and in my prepared remarks, we're encouraged by what we've seen to date as of the beginning of January.\nIf you were to assume that that were to hold, the next question is, what is the pace of the interest rate cuts that we see? If you see an instantaneous shock, we disclose to you what that means, right? So an instantaneous 100 basis points shock lower will be negative around $600 million, right? However, if it was more gradual in nature, which is similar to what you might see in the forward curve, you will have offsets associated with the reinvestment of the portfolio. So that will offset the rate decline, right? It will largely offset those rate declines, but it will depend. First order condition is, are deposits stable? Is the mix stable? And that's what we've seen so far. So let's see if that holds. And then second, what is the pace of the cuts over the course of the year?\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nAnalyst, JMP Securities\n\nThanks so much. And good morning, Ted and Sharon. Sharon, maybe just start with a question on investment banking, and good to hear about the tone improvement there. You know, sponsors have been less active than corporates, at least from the data we track. And we know sponsors have record dry powder, but higher interest rates, current valuations have been a little bit challenging for them. So just the question is whether, you know, they're in a position to return in force over the next year. You know, I think that's probably going to be necessary for full normalization in investment banking.\nAnd then just what you're seeing when you talk about the pipelines that you have, which are good, you know, what are sponsors doing in those pipelines? Thanks.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. Overall, the pipeline is more diversified than we've necessarily seen in historical years. We expect to see continued momentum in energy that we've seen over the past year. We see optimistic signs in real estate, and we see optimistic signs in technology. As it relates to sponsors, we would expect sponsors to come back. That will obviously take time, and I do think it will likely take a couple of potential prints in certain places. And other things that will be encouraging will be on the equity IPO side. What I'd say is we've moved from a period of time that was window driven, and that market is beginning to build momentum. And so the juxtaposition between the outlook for 2024, I think in 2023 is important there as well.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nAnalyst, JMP Securities\n\nOkay, terrific. And then a question for Ted. So I think you're pretty clear here. The strategic trajectory is not changing dramatically. But you know, we often get the question around, you know, stylistically, you know, what's changing. And so, you know, you have a different background than James. You know, I think everyone has their own management style, and you've run some big businesses very successfully for Morgan Stanley. So I'd love to maybe just hit on briefly, you know, how you would characterize kind of your style and just, you know, the ability to leverage your experience, and what may change as a result of that. Thanks.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Well, that's a great question. You know, James and I are much more similar than not. He brings to the table a positive mojo to the business from the time that he took over CEO when things were in, as you know, pretty rough shape. For now, in his 15th year of leadership as exec chair, he brings that positive spirit to every single interaction that we have, whether it's our operating and management committees, our risk meetings, these calls, client interactions, cultural work with our newbies and folks that are looking to get promoted in the organization. I think that spirit of positivity is something that has been contagious in the organization and is something that I'm a big believer in, and has worked well inside of the trading businesses, inside of investment banking.\nAnd I think you can feel it throughout the firm. So the reaffirmation of our partnership, our core values, and this articulation of the integrated firm, which is the next step now, because we've, you know, we went from trying to build our way back to generating the kind of enhanced scale and deeper moats through these gutsy acquisitions, that brought us to a place now where we can kind of look around and see how we can bring the firm closely together. I think the tone is one of determination. You know, I've been at this place for more than three decades, and we had our moment sort of before the abyss in 2008.\nAnd I think it's fair to say that the entire senior partnership, James, but also the folks that came to the organization, like myself, we are determined to not revisit anything that feels like those days. So the calling card here is durability, is consistency. We want to put up consistent results. Part of what you see in the strategic deck in the back, on the back page, those are very clear numbers, and we will hit them. We will hit those numbers. It will take time.\nWe will have to do all of the three yards and a cloud of dust work associated with thoughtfully working our way to those numbers such that when we hit them in a normalized environment, which will be part of the next arrow on page three in the years to come, we will have done so in a way where we can achieve full valuation on it because the view will be that they are not only achieved for a moment in time, but sustainable. And that obviously is also the calling card of James's tenure, which is that of consistency and durability. So if the first is his positive mojo and his second is this ethos of consistency, rigor, durability, I think the third at the end of the day has been to believe in what Morgan Stanley can aspire to for clients.\nAnd that is this integrated firm that we are something differentiated in our two channels. We're very clear on what we do and what we don't do, and that the cycle is very much a tailwind for us.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nChristian Bolu\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGood morning, Ted, and welcome to the call. Good morning, Sharon, as well. Maybe Ted, for you, on the trading businesses, you know, Morgan Stanley has suffered some share loss over the last couple of years, and your peers have been, you know, aggressively allocating capital to that business and gaining share. So maybe curious on how you're thinking about opportunities to grow those businesses and any plans to either invest more capital or resources into that business.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for the question. Christian, good to hear your voice.I think we know that we have achieved the top three position in the institutional securities business over the last number of years. But as you say on the margin, we have lost share to the number one and number two. And I think our view has been that that is a trade that we've been willing to make, both to continue to toggle the organization to the kind of revenue and profitability mix that you see today, but also importantly, the preservation of capital, which allows us today, irrespective of where we are in Basel III Endgame, to have a CET1 ratio that is well above 15%. As you've heard, I am with the team much focused on the durability of the dividend.\nAnd so, there's been a real focus on what shareholders want and what the business model ought to be for folks that want a durable Morgan Stanley. Now, that having been said, what you saw in 2020 was that we can be quite agile about getting capital resourcing to the client base if the tailwinds are there. Part of the proposition of being a global investment bank is that if, for example, balances start working in the prime brokerage context towards their 2021, 2022 highs, where we're about 10% away from those figures, well, then perhaps capital needs to be put towards equities, namely the prime brokerage business in behalf of clients.\nThere may be other periods where the event space, which was an allusion made on the previous question with respect to activity around financial sponsors, that that activity may come back because, of course, at some point, these large assets need to trade and the sponsor community is dependent at some level on the street to engage in velocity. So, there is no strategic decision at all to withdraw from the investment bank. I think what, what we would say in 2024 is that there is not really a choice between wealth and investment management or the institutional securities business. We will engage in both activities, but we will not be looking to chase the ball simply to have wallet share. The name of the game is to have an income statement that demonstrates operating leverage in each of the two businesses and ultimately to get to holistic returns.\nSo we are much focused on what the durability of that capital put to use is and where we can serve clients over a long period of time. We're paying attention to it very, very carefully. And what I'm most excited about, Christian, is that the cycle that's coming, the investment banking-led cycle, is coming at a time when we spent years putting together, and I know you've met some of these folks, our so-called integrated investment bank. What is differentiated about this place is that we have bankers, equities people, and fixed income folks who work together. They work together on client solutions. What I'm proposing, on our behalf, is now we extend that proposition to the firm where, in the wealth business, the investment management business, and inside the investment bank, we can work together around clients ultimately to generate operating leverage and returns.\nThat is, for me, the most exciting part of the next chapter, which is we've got the team, we've got the excess capital. Again, I like the excess capital, because it's part of what has differentiated us from the group and allows us to weather whatever comes through on Basel III Endgame. I, I would add, if in fact, the Basel III Endgame outcome is, is more favorable than perhaps what the street expects, we will adjust accordingly. We have tools. Part of that's the dividend. Part of that's investing in the business. Part of that obviously is buying stock back. Ultimately, having a real capital cushion is something that shareholders have come to expect from, from James, and that's something they should continue to expect from me.\n\nChristian Bolu\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nAwesome. Very clear, Ted. Thank you. And then maybe another one on Wealth Management margins, unfortunately, maybe for Sharon. I kind of hear you, Sharon, very clearly that you think higher revenues will drive margins over time, I guess. But if I guess, if I look at the business, you know, 2019 versus today, Wealth Management revenues are up 50% versus where they were in 2019, but your margins have compressed. And again, I know there's one-time items in the quarter or in the year, but it doesn't seem to me like bigger revenues have driven operating leverage. So what gives you confidence that going forward, you know, revenue growth will drive meaningful operating leverage?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nReally around the conversion. That's why I keep telling, I keep talking about the conversion, Christian. We brought the statistics up last year.\nWe brought the statistics up again this year in terms of seeing conversion from Workplace, about seeing net new assets coming in, and then seeing those assets migrate, new clients giving FAs time. All of those things are able to give us more durable asset management-based revenue as we move forward. So to your question, and I think Steve asked a similar question, the NII will fluctuate, obviously, based on rates and on consumer and customer behavior. And so the goal, while that has been something that we, you know, we say, don't forget the bank, don't forget the margin that you'll get from that, over time, the goal is to have a more sustainable $1 trillion of assets coming through both Wealth Management and Investment Management. Those assets will earn fees to some portion of it. And we see the migration into fee-based, right?\nWe have 50% of advisor-led assets sitting in fee-based accounts. That's the ultimate proposition from seeing an expanded margin and seeing the benefits of scale. We have invested in Workplace. We've invested in getting new channels and getting new participants. The time is now to begin to see conversion. We have evidence, you know, factual evidence that I've pointed to on this call to show you that we're making progress towards those goals.\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhat I'd add, Christian, is, again, all goals being equally important, we will hit that $10 trillion number. So part of it is to allow for some of this latency, if you will, on assets held away, on assets working their way through Workplace. It's a space that we are a leader in. It's a space that is relatively embryonic in the wealth business. We will allow for some time for those assets to convert. But the key, of course, is to have them in-house and then as well to see that folks who are our new workplace customers have assets held away in other existing brokerage accounts that they bring them to the firm as well.\n\nOperator\n\nDue to time constraints, we'll take just one question and no follow-up going forward from analysts. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, and congrats to Ted on the new role. I will, since I only get one shot at this, ask on the long-term targets. So, there were some slight changes here. We lost some pluses, and we lost a less than on the efficiency ratio, although in fairness, we gained a plus on the client assets.\nSo was that a reflection of these are long-term targets, so I'm guessing it's not really a reflection of the current environment. So what drove the tweak there to, you know, maybe signal some reduction in some of the upside scenarios? And, you know, how should you, you've referenced the fact that you need the environment to normalize. How should we be thinking about progression towards these targets and what specific non-environmental actions you can be taking in order to move the ball there?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes. Excellent question. And a lot of time given to consideration on pluses, and the like. This for me was sort of an easy call. The page is one that we all own. And getting to 30% margins is a number that we want to achieve.\nAnd at that level, having hit something that is approaching $10 trillion assets, we're going to be in a really great place. And that would be a reasonable time to say, \"Hey, how about more?\" And we'd say, \"Okay, well, clearly we're going to continue to grow assets because the asset number, the way that TAM is, is gigantic.\" James has mentioned $20 trillion at one point. There are client assets that will keep us busy for many generations to come. Whether the pre-tax margin of wealth should go above 30% at that point or not, I'd like to get to the 30, and I want to get there durably and thoughtfully. And the mid-20s is a range that you've seen us trade at, the business to work well at.\nAnd we believe we can, when economic conditions normalize, as Sharon has described, and as new assets get put to work, some combination of money markets and T-bills coming into the market again, workplace coming through the funnel, all three channels working on the back of increased transaction activity, new issues, and the like, we should slowly and durably work our way back to the 30. The efficiency ratio, as you know, is just another way of saying 30% margins for the enterprise. Now, by definition, the investment bank, which has more capital and more underlying risk, should have margins that exceed 30% over time. So it's fair to say that if we're hitting 30% margins in Wealth Management, we certainly should be at an enterprise efficiency ratio of 1 minus 70, 30% as well.\nSo 30% plus could be a way of thinking about it, but I wanted to set up numbers where the team knew that they are specific and that we needed to hit them. And then finally, with respect to returns on capital, this gets to the importance of our being stewards of that capital, what we pay out in the form of dividends, what we buy back, and durably how we run the place. So we thought that 20%, ROTCE, which is something we hit during the COVID years, but of course, those were against macroeconomic conditions, which were unusual and highly favorable, that we can do 20% in a normalized environment. So this may be on the margin, and James liked it too.\nWhen we talked about it, stylistically, my view was, and the team shares it, that 10 trillion of client assets, we should get there and just keep on going. But the other three, effectively in removing the pluses, it's simply reaffirming that those numbers will be hit. We will hit 30% pre-tax margins in wealth, 70% efficiency ratio for the firm, and 20% ROTCE. It will take time. There will be the challenges you would expect in making that happen. And of course, we need economic conditions to line up in a favorable way. But over time, those are the firm-wide goals, and we wanted to be very specific about that for you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our last question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. Ted?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nNice, nice, nice, nice ink. Enjoy the story.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay. Well, it looks like you have a heavy lift after following James Gorman, shoes', path. What is your message to the, the wealth managers and investment managers, that half of the company, that you haven't run in the past? So you've proven yourself in the half of the company that's clearly capital markets and Wall Street banking. But what's your message to the other half of the company at a time when they've had a step down in their, their growth rates, net asset flows in wealth and outflows in investment management?\n\nTed Pick\n\nCEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, thanks for the question, Mike. You know, the wealth, the wealth business, is actually in my blood. My dad and my father-in-law were both brokers once upon a time, and I grew up studying that business as a kid.\nI think it is absolutely that which has differentiated Morgan Stanley during this 15-year period. The ability to integrate Smith Barney and build out something that is truly special has been, existentially, as you know, better than most, but also thematically, exactly what the firm has needed. In no way has it actually worked to the disbenefit of the investment bank. As you know, the history of our merger from 1997 was largely about social issues, but the industrial idea wasn't necessarily off at all. That to build a world-class wealth manager would be something that would have enormous barriers to entry and have run well and run in a first-class way to deliver value to clients in a differentiated manner.\nWhat we have done, thanks to the leadership of Andy Saperstein with Jed Finn, and then the investment management business with Dan Simkowitz, now moving over to the investment bank, and Ben Huneke and Jacques Chappuis running wealth investment management today, is we've got effectively the full funnel. We've got the soup to nuts, self-directed, the traditional advisory channel, and this new channel workplace, working as one. I've spent time working some of the chairmen and hitting a branch here in Midtown and spending some time with folks that are actually making the engine work. I think it's fair to say that we at one point were calling the wealth and investment management business the ballast, which was the right word because we wanted to convey durability. But I'd submit to you, Mike, and hopefully you'll appreciate the spirit in which I say this.\nI think it's actually the engine. I think this will be the engine for further Morgan Stanley growth. If opportunities were to come before us in the years to come, of course, we could staple them on and do something inorganically, as James alluded to. Perhaps that would be outside the US where I've spent a whole bunch of time. But in running the actual organic business as it currently stands, we're truly a group of one. And as you know, having spent time inside the knitting of MS, what we're most excited about, Mike, you as a student of corporate culture and these investment banks, I think what you'd be most excited about is just how well we all get along. There is zero friction in the leadership ranks across infrastructure, across wealth and investment management, and across the investment bank.\nSo the beauty of where we are today is that all of us as shareholders and custodians of the Morgan Stanley idea and the Morgan Stanley culture of first-class business in a first-class way are very much focused on growing both pieces of the firm. And this leading wealth and asset manager has a lot more room and will grow, as I've said, to the 10 trillion of assets. And at the same time, I don't see any reason why we can't continue to pick up high-quality, durable wallet inside the investment bank and generate operating leverage in that business too.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our question and answer session for today. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you again for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.\nToday's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\n\nJames Patrick Gorman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks all for joining us. As anticipated, the market environment in aggregate remain mixed, continuing a pattern we've seen over the past several quarters. Notwithstanding the net result for Morgan Stanley was we generated $13 billion, a little over $13 billion in revenues, $2.3 billion in net income and ROTCE of 13.5%.\nOur concerns around the tight employment market, higher commodity prices, inflationary pressures that may impact fed policy provide additional challenges later in the quarter. But we are seeing increasing evidence of M&A and underwriting calendars that are building, and while we expect momentum to continue this year, given the fourth quarter has some seasonal considerations we expect most of the activity to materialize in 2024.\nMeanwhile, it's our job to control what we can control. Firstly, we successfully completed the E*TRADE integration this quarter. That was a massive undertaking and the expenses relating to that have been bleeding through the P&L for a couple of years. It involved just migrating 14 million accounts onto our platform. And honestly, it went incredibly well really a seamless performance by the team.\nThis conversion allows us to further execute on our strategy, building our revenue synergies across channels and attracting clients to our best-in-class advice offering. Secondly, on the capital front, we bought back $1.5 billion in stock. We averaged a nearly 4% dividend yield over the quarter and, at the same time, delivered a CET1 ratio of 15.5%, which is 260 basis points over our most recent regulatory requirement. We clearly have a significant capital buffer.\nAlso, you saw the full details of the initial Basel III in-game proposal. As you all know, this is a proposal, not the final regulation. I'm going to repeat that. It's a proposal. There is an enormous amount of energy being spent, conversations being had across industry groups and agency Board members, and I've been deeply involved myself along Sharon Yeshaya. And we've been told many times that the Federal Reserve strongly welcome comments on this proposal. Given this, I anticipate that the agencies will be open to considering thoughtful changes before it's adopted as a final rule. But let me be crystal clear, because of the buffers we have built, even if this proposal were implemented today as written, we have adequate capital to meet the ultimate requirement.\nNeedless to say, there are many years between now and then. In the quarter, Wealth Management generated net new assets of $36 billion that's obviously below recent quarters. it's consistent with what I've been saying for a long time, these numbers will bounce around and in any quarterly period, there are always idiosyncratic things. By this year, we've had 2 quarters where we had some surprise on the upside. And in aggregate for the year, we're totaling net new assets of $235 billion year-to-date.\nOur annualized growth rate is at the high end of the 5% to 7% range that we've been looking at and it's consistent, in fact, it's spot on with our 3-year target of $1 trillion per net new money. Overall, this firm is in excellent shape, notwithstanding the geopolitical and market turmoil that we find ourselves in. My hope and expectation is to hand over to Morgan Stanley with as clean as late as possible and deal with a few of our outstanding issues in the next couple of months. I'm very excited about the future of this firm. It's leadership, its strategy and its culture.\nAnd I'll now turn it over to Sharon, who can discuss the quarter in greater detail. And then together, as always, we'll take your questions. Thank you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.3 billion in the third quarter. Our EPS was $1.38, and our ROTCE was 13.5%. Results in the third quarter were solid against a mixed market backdrop. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. Together, severance and DCP impacted the year-to-date efficiency ratio by nearly 150 basis points. As we invest for growth, our integration efforts have remained a priority. Integration-related expenses were $68 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate a similar amount in the fourth quarter as previously communicated.\nNow to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $5.7 billion, declining 3% versus the prior year. Equity and fixed income results were in line with long-term historical averages. Investment banking revenues remain depressed on lower volumes. However, leading indicators across advisory and underwriting progressed positively evidenced by a notable increase of Morgan Stanley's announced volumes in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.\nInvestment Banking revenues decreased to $938 million. The change to the previous year was driven by lower results in advisory and debt underwriting. Advisory revenues of $449 million reflected a decline in completed transactions due to lower announced volumes in prior periods. Despite the weaker quarterly results, we continue to see broad sector diversification of our completed deals and the backlog reflects a similar pattern.\nEquity underwriting revenues were $237 million. Overall activity remained muted relative to historical averages. While increased confidence supported early September issuances a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve and resulting moves in interest rates serve as a reminder that this market remains window driven. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $252 million, down versus the prior year, primarily reflecting lower non-investment grade events. We are encouraged by the growing client dialogue and bake-off activity across sectors and geographies. The pickup in our announced M&A volumes in the third quarter speak to the trends we've observed at the end of the last quarter, but the landscape continues to evolve.\nAs we look ahead, corporate confidence will largely be determined by the overall health of the consumer and the stability of input costs. While risks remain, including geopolitical threats, the underlying trends suggest activity is building, and there is a desire among clients to pursue their long-term strategic objectives. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion, the business performed in line with historical averages with relative strength in Europe and Asia. Prime Brokerage revenues were solid.\nClient balances were modestly higher compared to last year. The results reflect narrower spreads and the geographic mix of those balances. Cash revenues declined versus the prior year on lower overall global volumes. Derivative results increased year-over-year, reflecting higher client activity with particular strength in Europe. Fixed income revenues were $1.9 billion, Micro results increased versus the prior year, supported by strength in securitized products, both in agency and non-agency trading. Macro revenues decreased versus last year's elevated results with lower revenues in rates and foreign exchange. Results reflect lower client conviction, particularly around the future of Central Bank policy.\nCommodity revenues increased year-over-year on the back of a constructive trading environment, particularly for oil. Other revenues of $277 million improved versus last year, driven by lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans, net of loan hedges and higher net interest income and fees. Turning to ISG lending and provision. The allowance for credit losses and ISG loans and lending commitments increased slightly to $1.4 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $93 million. The increase was driven by a continued negative outlook for the commercial and real estate sector. Net charge-offs were $39 million. It's primarily related to 1 commercial real estate loan in the office sector.\nTurning to Wealth Management. Revenues of $6.4 billion were strong, an increase from the prior year. The growth of asset management revenues more than offset the cyclical declines in net interest income, underscoring their durability. As designed, our asset-led strategy drives steady fee-based flows that support asset management revenues. With this in mind, we remain focused on asset migration into our adviser-led channel. This quarter, our long-term strategy took a critical step forward as we completed the last major milestone of our E*TRADE integration. Successfully converting nearly $900 billion of client AUM onto the Morgan Stanley platform. This will continue to enhance our ability to introduce clients and advisers and seamlessly transition them into advice-based relationships.\nMoving on to the business metrics in the third quarter. Pretax profit was $1.7 billion, and the PBT margin was 26.7%. Integration expenses as well as DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 150 basis points. Net new assets were $36 billion, bringing year-to-date NNA to $235 billion, which represents over 7% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net new assets in the quarter were supported by new clients and positive net recruiting into the advisor-led channel.\nThe multiyear buildup of assets provide a foundational pipeline into our adviser-led channel, evidenced by fee-based flows of $22.5 billion in the third quarter alone. Asset management revenues of $3.6 billion increased 7% year-over-year. Higher average assets and the impact of cumulative positive fee-based flows over the past year drove the increase. Transactional revenues, excluding DCP, were $820 million, up 7% year-over-year. Results reflect opportunistic deployment of new capital by retail clients into alternatives particularly into private equity and private credit. Bank lending balances were roughly flat versus the prior quarter.\nGrowth in mortgages and tailored lending, offset paydowns and securities-based lending. Total deposits of $340 billion remained stable compared to the prior quarter. Still the deposit mix has shifted as clients continue to allocate rate-sensitive cash to higher-yielding cash alternatives available on the platform, including our expanded savings offering.\nIn addition, the quarter saw consistent positive monthly inflows into equity markets from suite balances, ongoing evidence of the improvement of the retail client sentiment. Net interest income was $2 billion. The sequential decline reflects a continued shift in the deposit mix. Looking towards the rest of this year based on where we exited the quarter, we expect NII to trend lower. The magnitude will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of rates.\nWealth Management business model is focused on steady asset aggregation, delivering strong solutions and advice to clients, while growing durable fees and expanding margin through the cycle. We are continuing to invest in our industry-leading position and the sustainability of our long-term growth. As the backdrop recovers, advisers remain well positioned to capture greater asset opportunity supported by our multichannel model that was built to attract new client relationships.\nTurning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.3 billion increased 14% compared to the prior year, supported by higher asset management revenues. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of approximately $7 billion were driven predominantly by headwinds to our MSM active equity growth strategies, which continue to see redemptions consistent with the industry. Excluding the segment's outflows, year-to-date long-term flows across the franchise were slightly positive. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for Parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies, a partial offset to the headwinds of the quarter.\nLiquidity and overlay services had net flows of $5.7 billion, driven by demand for parametric institutional portfolio overlay solutions and our liquidity strategies. Specific to Parametric and across the entire franchise, overlay and long-term net flows in the quarter were almost $7 billion, underscoring strong trends in this business. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year on higher average AUM. Performance-based income and other revenues were $24 million, supported by the diversification of our balance sheet light platform. Results were driven by gains in U.S. private equity, offset by weakness in Asia private equity and real estate.\nOur strategic focus on secular growth areas and the expansion of our global footprint remains in place. Ongoing investments in our businesses, including our market-leading Parametric franchise, as well as our continued growth in innovation in private markets position us well to best serve our clients. Turning to the balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio stands at 15.5%, roughly flat versus last quarter. Standardized RWAs declined sequentially to [ $445 million ], reflecting our ongoing prudent resource management and market movements at the end of the quarter.\nWe continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1.5 billion of common stock during the quarter. Taken in the context of the mixed environment, we are pleased with the firm's resiliency and our competitive positioning. As clients gain more conviction, we expect our institutional business to capture more opportunities particularly in investment banking. This increased client conviction will also further support asset growth in wealth and investment management. We will continue to press our advantages and execute on our growth strategies all while prudently managing our capital profile.\nWith that, we will now open the line up to questions.",

On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded.

Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\n\nJames Patrick Gorman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2023 was in -- was very eventful for our industry, but not so eventful for Morgan Stanley. Firm delivered strong results with revenues of over $14.5 billion, net income of $3 billion, ROTCE of 17% and net new asset flows of $110 billion. At the same time, we bought back $1.5 billion of stock while maintaining a CET ratio of 15.1%. In many ways, it was an excellent test to Morgan Stanley and the opportunity to show the strength and stability of our business model.\nLet me just touch briefly on the turmoil and the banking sector. In my view, we are not in a banking crisis, but we have had and may still have a crisis among some banks. I believe strong regulatory intervention on both sides of the Atlantic led to the cauterization of the damage. I consider the current issues as not remotely comparable to 2008. I was pleased that Morgan Stanley, along with the other large U.S. banks became part of the solution by providing an uninsured deposit line of $30 billion to First Republic Bank. Someone who lived through the darkest days of 2008 where Morgan Stanley was seen as part of the problem, it's indeed rewarding to be here 14 years later as part of the solution.\nTurning back to our own company. While the performance of the overall business was strong, the results reflected the impact of the environment. In Wealth Management, positive flows of $110 billion were a very strong result, reflect continued growth in the model together with the flight to quality. This obviously gives us a good start to our 1 trillion every 3 years target. Investment management also benefited from diversification as long-term outflows moderated, and we saw strength in Parametric and also on the liquidity product.\nOverall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&A remain very subdued. As I've said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we're seeing a growing M&A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story.\nOn the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves. Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all 3 of our client platforms. I'll now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm's results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels. In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets, and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings.\nThe firm's first quarter efficiency ratio was 72%. Deferred cash-based compensation plans negatively impacted our firm's efficiency ratio by approximately 60 basis points. Ongoing technology and marketing and business development investments as well as higher litigation costs, increased operational expenses versus the prior year. Given the broader market uncertainty and the inflationary environment, expense management remains a priority, although we continue to prioritize investments in our long-term goals.\nNow to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $6.8 billion, an 11% decline from the very strong prior year. Fixed Income and equity results partially offset weakness in banking as we helped our clients' intermediate markets through this period of heightened uncertainty. From a regional perspective, Asia delivered its third highest quarter ever with strength in areas of both, fixed income and equity, aided by the policy dynamics in Japan and the China reopening.\nInvestment Banking revenues decreased year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Solid revenue [ in ] advisory supported results while ongoing market volatility continue to pressure equity and noninvestment-grade underwriting. Advisory revenues were $638 million, benefiting from the completion of previously announced transactions. Revenues were down versus the strong prior year on the back of lower announced volumes in 2022.\nEquity underwriting revenues were $202 million, down 22%, largely as a result of depressed IPO activity. While IPO and follow-on activity remained muted, issuers selectively accessed market windows. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $407 million. Results were supported by an open investment grade market and opportunistic loan activity. Clients are engaged as we help them navigate an uncertain backdrop, and our investment banking backlog is building. Financial sponsors continue to look for opportunities to invest. Within underwriting, we are encouraged by the issuance activity during constructive windows.\nOf course, further conversion from pipeline to realized is predicated on clarity around macroeconomic conditions, stable financing markets and increased corporate confidence. Equity revenues were $2.7 billion, a solid quarter against an uncertain and volatile backdrop. We continue to be a leader in this business, and the results reflect our global and diversified footprint. Cash revenues decreased versus the prior first quarter on lower global volumes. Derivatives results were solid compared to a strong quarter last year as we help navigate -- as we help clients navigate challenging markets.\nTime Brokerage revenues were down as equity market levels declined. Clients remained engaged, and balances increased steadily throughout the quarter. Fixed income revenues of $2.6 billion were strong, though lower versus the prior year's elevated result, which was impacted by the beginning of the Fed rate hiking cycle and a start of the war in Ukraine. This quarter's performance was driven by rates and credit. Macro revenues were down modestly year-over-year with relative strength in rates versus foreign exchange in the comparison period.\nThe volatility created by varying expectations around global central bank policy aided results across regions. Micro results were up versus the prior year, supported by client engagement. Commodity revenues moderated meaningfully compared to the robust results in the previous first quarter, largely due to reduced volatility in European markets and the mild weather in the U.S. Other revenues of $245 million improved versus the prior year, largely driven by higher revenues on corporate lending activity and gains related to DCP.\nTurning to ISG lending and provisions. Our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments increased to $1.3 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $189 million, and net charge-offs were $70 million. The increase in provisions was driven by the higher recessionary probability and worsening outlook for commercial real estate. The charge-offs were substantially all from a handful of specific loans.\nTurning to Wealth Management. Revenues were $6.6 billion. Movements in DCP positively impacted revenues by approximately $100 million compared to a negative impact of nearly $300 million in last year's first quarter. Net new asset growth of $110 billion was a standout as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy. Pretax profit was $1.7 billion, and the PBT margin was 26.1%. The margin reflects a more favorable revenue mix, offset by higher credit provisions and an increase in expenses as we continue to invest in our business, inclusive of integration-related expenses. Credit provisions were $78 million, including those that impacted revenue. And the integration-related expenses for the quarter were $53 million, in line with our expectations.\nForward growth drivers remain robust. Net new assets were very strong at $110 billion for the quarter, representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis, the results illustrate our ability to attract assets and the payoff of our investments to support growth. We saw contribution from all channels with notable strength in the adviser led channel, particularly amongst existing clients. The events in March and the rising interest rate environment over the past year impacted client behavior. Clients increased their allocation to cash equivalents such as money market funds and U.S. treasuries by over 60% versus last year. At the same time, deposits declined in the quarter by 3% to $341 billion.\nWe believe investable assets stayed within Morgan Stanley as our clients worked with advisers to help navigate the volatile markets. Today, adviser-led assets invested in cash and cash equivalents stand at a peak of 23% compared to historical average of approximately 18%. Over time, we believe clients will reinvest these balances across more assets when the market outlook improves. In the interim, given our broad product offering, clients are choosing to invest in cash with Morgan Stanley through the cycle, positioning us to provide them with more reinvestment choices down the road.\nNet interest income was $2.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year. Results reflect the impact of higher interest rates and lower sweep balances. Fee-based flows of $22 billion were strong. Asset management revenues were $3.4 billion, down 7% versus last year, reflecting lower market levels. Transactional revenues were $921 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues were down 12% versus last year due to fewer new issuance opportunities and reduced activity levels compared to the beginning of 2022. Lending balances declined this quarter to $144 billion, led by paydowns in securities-based lending, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Importantly, our strategy is working and we are seeing channel migration from workplace to adviser-led.\nAdviser-led flows, originating from workplace relationships reached $28 billion in this quarter alone, double versus this time last year, and this compares to the approximate $50 billion we saw annually over the past 3 years. Furthermore, almost 90% of these flows were from assets held away, also consistent with what we have seen historically. Our strategy remains in place to best serve our clients and support the firm's path to reach $10 trillion in client assets.\nMoving to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% year-over-year, primarily on lower AUM due to the decline of asset values and the cumulative effect of outflows over the prior year. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows were $2.4 billion as equity outflows moderated in the quarter. In fixed income, outflows in floating rate loans were partially offset by high yield and emerging markets. Finally, alternatives and solutions delivered strength, driven mostly by demand for Parametric fixed income customized portfolios as well as inflows into private credit.\nLiquidity and overlay services had inflows of $13.9 billion. Positive liquidity inflows of $37 billion were partially offset by outflows related to a single client relationship. Asset Management and related fees decreased versus the prior year to $1.2 billion due to lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue. Performance-based income and other revenues were $41 million. Results were supported by gains in our private alternatives portfolio, reflecting the diversity of the platform.\nIntegration-related expenses were $24 million in the quarter, in line with expectations. A key focus area remains maximizing our global distribution capabilities, and we continue to see momentum internationally, particularly from the Eaton Vance fixed income team. Our investments across a broad array of strategies and capabilities, including active ETFs, Parametric Customization and Alternatives position us well to benefit from the diversification as well as to serve our global client base.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Spot assets were $1.2 trillion, largely in line with the prior quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15.1% and SLR at 5.5%. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily on client activity, consistent with seasonal patterns. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, including buying back $1.5 billion of common stock. Our tax rate was 19.3% for the quarter. The vast majority of share-based award conversion takes place in the first quarter, creating a tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility.\nAs James discussed, the fallout resulting from the events in March is not indicative of the systemic stress that the industry faced during the global financial crisis. Our clear and consistent strategy allowed us to enter this environment well positioned. The outlook for the remainder of this year is difficult to predict. We are keenly aware that opening and functioning markets and economic stability are integral in aiding confidence moving forward. In the interim, we remain focused on supporting our clients and attracting assets to our platform. With that, we will now open up the line to questions.",

On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer.\nThis call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.\nToday's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update.\nWithin the strategic update, certain reported information has been adjusted as noted. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\n\nJames Patrick Gorman\n\nChairman & CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The macro backdrop of the last year presented challenges we haven't seen for some time. The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and led to some -- led to very little strategic activity and capital raising.\nDespite volatility throughout the year, Morgan Stanley demonstrated resilience and delivered on an ROTCE of 16%, including integration-related expenses from our deals. The firm did what it was supposed to do with our more stable Wealth and Investment Management businesses offsetting declines in Institutional Securities. This is hard evidence of the transformation we've made to become increasingly durable and a stark contrast to the 8% ROTCE we had in the last notable challenging environment of 2015. When markets rebound, we will capitalize on growth once again across the full firm, and from an even stronger position.\nBefore turning to Sharon to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and the full year, I'll walk you through now how we plan to achieve these goals in our annual strategic update appropriately titled Delivering Growth Through the Next Decade.\nBriefly first, I'd like to acknowledge the many contributions Jon Pruzan made as CFO and COO. As you know, he's retiring from Morgan Stanley at the end of this month, and we wish him the absolute best.\nPlease now turn to the deck and to Slide 3. What informs our confidence and growth strategy is that we know who we are. We've been clear about that for over a decade. Our clarity of purpose has been a key driver of our success to date, and the next decade will be no different.\nOn Slide 4, you can see we've been consistent since the financial crisis. We have a client-centric franchise with a common objective to facilitate capital flows between those who have it and those who need it. We're committed to our clients and to the markets we're in, clearly illustrated by the leading competitive positions we have. In each of our businesses, we have a significant competitive moat, which will enable us to maintain and further enhance our strength.\nSlide 5 highlights the strategic decisions we've made over the past decades that are focused on aligning markets -- ourselves to the markets where we perform best. And these are core businesses with scale in major markets; that are on the whole, more balance sheet-light; and benefit from more durable fee-based revenues. We continue to invest in these areas to drive future growth. We have proven track record in our ability to acquire and integrate the businesses that are aligned with this strategy, namely within Wealth and Investment Management.\nImportantly, we've also taken action to get out of businesses that are not core to this flow of capital. While we may facilitate activities across varied markets, we do not own businesses that are built around unsecured consumer credit, payments, physical handling of commodities and the like. Instead, we focus on markets we know best, and our ability is there to support our clients in those markets.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. This illustrates the ongoing growth and shift of our business mix. As we continue to grow our client assets, we expect Wealth and Investment Management will become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pretax profit. The stability of the firm will be further enhanced by this growth, all the while coupled with a preeminent institutional franchise.\nFair to say, our business model was tested this year, as you can see on Slide 7. 2022 was a paradigm shift. Firstly, the common -- continuation of the first pandemic in 100 years, the first war in Europe in over 70 years and the highest inflation in 40 years. Despite lower asset values and an anemic underwriting calendar, the firm performed well. We generated, as I said before, a 16% ROTCE; had the most excess risk-based capital of our peers; and attracted over $300 billion of net new assets; all while integrating 2 major acquisitions.\nSo now moving to the opportunities to maximize growth in the next decade, let's start with Wealth Management. On Slide 8, you can see we have leadership positions across channels, reflecting our combination of best-in-class advice and best-in-class technology. And we have the ability to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey. This allows us to grow with our clients along the way and provides the opportunity for clients to migrate across channels.\nThe growth of our business is reflected in our higher average daily revenues, something I've been tracking for well over a decade. 2022, every trading day saw revenues in excess of $80 million, and over 1/3 of those exceeded $100 million a day. Contrast that with only 3 years ago, where 95% of trading revenues were each below $80 million, and none exceeded $100 million.\nThe history of the journey as illustrated on Slide 7. Wealth Management has gone through a powerful transformation, as you all know, including with the most significant recent acquisitions in -- of E*TRADE and Solium, which have expanded our client base with 2 new channels. Today, we have 18 million relationships. We focus on deepening those relationships by offering the right product at the right time and consolidating assets under our platform. From here, we're building on the scale and the tools to reach -- and the reach that will propel future growth.\nNet interest income has certainly been part of the profitability expansion to date, and you can see the driving forces highlighted on Slide 10. We have invested in expanding our bank offerings, allowing us to offer attractive products to our clients on both sides of their balance sheet to meet their needs. We've nearly doubled our lending balances over the last 3 years, and we expect to continue to grow attractive high-quality loans.\nOn the other side, our deposits franchise has grown significantly since 2019 and will continue to support future NII through various cycles. Approximately 90% of our deposits are sourced from our Wealth Management client base. And in the current rising rate environment, our cost of deposits is more efficient than that we experienced in the last rate-hiking cycle. Sharon will discuss this important topic and our outlook around NII further in a few minutes.\nLet's turn to Slide 11. This now talks about NNA growth: Net new assets. Over the last 3 years, our platform generated nearly $1 trillion of net new assets, showing a clear step change from prior periods and marking Morgan Stanley as a leader across our peer group as an asset accumulator. Given the scale and reach of our businesses, we expect to deliver this pace of asset accumulation going forward. Obviously, there will be ups and downs in individual years. But over a 3-year period, we expect to drive approximately $1 trillion in net new assets.\nMost importantly, as you can see on the right-hand side of this page, no single source is accounting for greater than 25% of this net new money. Some people think it's just a result of recruiting. It is absolutely not. It's a combination of several things which the team has described as filling the funnel of net new money.\nYou can see on Slide 12, which shows our growth in client assets, we have experienced that through our workplace channel. We estimate now that relationships, wealth held away, has expanded by about 4x in the last 3 years. With our ability to serve clients across the entire wealth spectrum, we're well positioned to consolidate a portion of these assets.\nFurther, the workplace channel continues to bring new relationships to the platform. We've executed on key steps to deepen those. We've already reached our goal to roll out companion accounts to 90% of workplace participants and to achieve 30% retention of stock plan assets. We look forward to even higher retention.\nThe results of our advice-driven strategy are illustrated on Slide 13. The workplace channel has driven the majority of our growth in client relationships and stands at 12 million relationships to date. While it can take several years to deepen those, we've already seen success in some parts of the offering, that of our stock plan administrative services.\nOver the last 3 years, we've had approximately $350 billion of after-tax vested inflows. Vesting assets gives us more opportunity to deliver an integrated client experience, and that's allowed us to showcase the power of advice. To date, we've already seen adviser-led flows of approximately $150 billion that originated from a workplace relationship. A portion of those assets are the stock plan vested balances, but a larger portion are from assets that were previously held away. In short, we will -- as we deliver our full suite of capabilities, our strategy to attract clients to advice is working.\nInvestment Management has also delivered strong fee-based growth over the course of its own transformation, as you can see on Slide 14, which encapsulates the business together with Eaton Vance. This business has more than doubled its durable asset management and related fees since 2014. And importantly, this significantly larger revenue base is more diversified. Increased diversification from fixed income, customization and alternatives continues to support results in more volatile equity markets.\nWe remain very aligned to key growth areas. Our alternative investment capital is at $210 billion, with strong growth in private credit; real assets, including infrastructure; our multi-strategy hedge fund platform; and special situations. And customization by our market-leading parametric business continues to be a significant growth engine.\nShifting to Institutional Securities on Slide 15. We have a global and balanced franchise. And our integrated investment bank has and continues to focus on meeting clients where they are active. This has served us well as our strength is evident across various market environments. We remain a leader in equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our fixed income franchise focused on our strongest capabilities.\nOn Slide 16, you can see our institutional business remains a top 3 global leader in the industry, as demonstrated by a wallet share positions. We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capital-light businesses. At the same time, we've shown prudence over resources as illustrated clearly by the disciplined RWA usage, which actually dropped from '22 to -- '21 to '22 and our consistent GSIB surcharge of 3%.\nLet's move to our capital strategy on Slide 17. We have 200 basis points of excess capital above our regulatory requirement. This is intentional. Our capital strategy has focused on bringing the risk down in our businesses, and we've seen a steady decline in our SCB, excluding the dividend add-on, relative -- reflective of our more durable business mix. Our capital position gives us enormous flexibility, and we're comfortable with our decision to be prudently positioned.\nOn Slide 18, you can see our excess capital position enables us to continue to invest in our business for future growth and deliver robust returns to shareholders. Our business transformation, especially the durable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management, enable us to double that dividend -- enabled us to double our dividend in 2021 and further increase it by 11% in 2022. Over the same time, we've reduced our shares outstanding from the much higher levels driven by the impact of our recent acquisitions. Taken together, we delivered a 9% capital return to our shareholders last year. We remain committed to ongoing shareholder return, adjusting always for whatever the business performance is and the regulatory requirements' demand.\nShifting to how we see the future state on Slide 19, starting with the expected path to $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management. We've demonstrated our ability to generate, over the last 3 years, positive net new assets of approximately $300 billion a year. Combining that with reasonable average market assumptions give us the confidence this will lead to $10 trillion in client assets in reasonable years ahead.\nNow let's consider this within the broader firm picture, and bear with me for a minute. In 2022, the firm delivered $14 billion of pretax profit. In this future scenario of $10 trillion of assets, which I believe will happen, generating approximately 50 basis points of revenue, which is about what we're doing currently, at a 30% pretax margin, which is within 2% of what we're doing currently. If you put that math together, it should create, of itself, over $14 billion of pretax income. As you can see, that exceeds that of the full firm today just from the wealth and asset management businesses.\nSo if you pull it all together, just to wrap it up, Slide 20 reiterates our confidence in our performance goals. They have not changed on account of what's gone on in the markets in the last 12 months. These are the metrics we need to support our longer-term objectives.\nOf note, we've added a new goal that I spoke to earlier, that we've talked about in the last 6 months, to generate $1 trillion in net new assets approximately every 3 years. Again, I'm sure there will be volatility quarter by quarter, year by year. But as we've demonstrated through the funnel of sources, we expect an outcome over 3 years of approximately $1 trillion. That's about, by the way, 5% to 7% of beginning period assets within wealth management.\nAs we approach 2023, we do so with quiet confidence, recognizing we have a line of sight with the durability of our Wealth and Investment Management businesses and our market share-leading positions across much of Institutional Securities. As always, our objectives are subject to major moves in the economic, political or regulatory environment. However, with a constructive outlook and a proven track record we've delivered thus far, we fully expect to achieve our goals over time.\nI will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results. And we'd be delighted to take your questions.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, and good morning. In a complex year, the firm delivered solid results. Full year revenues were $53.7 billion and PBT was $14.1 billion. The fourth quarter contributed to $12.7 billion in revenues and PBT of $2.8 billion.\nThe strategic investments we have made over the last decade have paid off. Wealth Management had a record year and fixed income had its strongest performance in over a decade. While the firm was broadly impacted by increased volatility and economic uncertainty, the business model performed very well in a challenging environment, as it was designed to do.\nThe full year results included $470 million of integration-related expenses, of which, $120 million were incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these impacts, EPS was $6.36 and $1.31 for the full year and for the quarter, respectively. The full year ROTCE was 15.3% and 15.7%, excluding the costs associated with integration. In the quarter, severance expenses of $133 million related to a December employee action and a net discrete tax benefit -- or net discrete tax benefits of $89 million largely offset each other through net income. The full year efficiency ratio was 73.2%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 72.4%.\nTotal expenses were approximately flat to the prior year. Lower compensation expenses, principally related to movements in DCP and on lower revenues, were offset by higher non-compensation expenses primarily driven by investments in technology as well as increased marketing and business development spend. As a reminder, this year also included a $200 million charge related to a legal matter regarding the firm's record-keeping requirement in the second quarter.\nAs the environment evolved over the course of 2022, we actively managed our expense base. Cognizant of the ongoing macro uncertainty, we continue to review efficiency opportunities. We are in the final stages of completing our integration of both E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, and this will be the last quarter we present measures that exclude integration-related expenses from reported results. However, particularly as it relates to the integration of E*TRADE, the final back-office integration remains scheduled to conclude in 2023. We expect to incur approximately $325 million of additional integration-related expenses this year. These expenses will largely be spread evenly across quarters with approximately 2/3 related to E*TRADE and 1/3 related to Eaton Vance.\nNow to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues of $24.4 billion declined 18% from the record prior year. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $4.8 billion. Overall, quarterly client engagement across fixed income and equities tapered from the higher levels seen in the first 9 months of the year, reflective of seasonality and the macroeconomic environment.\nWeaker Investment Banking results persisted, reflecting the challenging banking backdrop. Investment Banking revenues were $5.2 billion for the full year, down 49% from the record prior year. Advisory delivered its second best result, supported in part by the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Underwriting was more challenged, in line with the broader market.\nFull year global equity volumes dropped to levels unseen in the last 20 years. Debt volumes contracted following the first quarter. And while the market was receptive to higher-quality issuance, activity was limited to constructive market periods. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 49% from the prior year. Lower completed M&A and underwriting market volumes weighed on results.\nAs we have highlighted in prior quarters, client dialogue and engagement remains high as clients seek advice to navigate the difficult environment. Greater economic clarity should lead to increased confidence to undertake strategic transactions. And looking ahead, we expect issuers to take advantage of these windows of opportunity.\nEquity full year trading -- excuse me, equity full year revenues were $10.8 billion, representing another strong year of over $10 billion and making us a global leader in this business. Revenues declined 6% from the record prior year, primarily driven by lower market activities. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting lower asset levels and volumes. Prime brokerage revenues were lower than the prior year as average client balances declined from record levels driven by lower equity markets and deleveraging. Cash results declined on lower client activity across regions.\nDerivative results increased slightly as the business navigated the market volatility well. Last year's fourth quarter also benefited from a mark-to-market gain on an investment versus a markdown this quarter.\nFixed income revenues of $9 billion for the full year were the highest in over a decade. The divergence between the Fed's guidance on financial tightening and conditions and the market expectations engaged clients and drove revenues in macro while volatile energy markets benefited commodities.\nQuarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance benefited from higher client engagement as inflation expectations moderated and clients repositioned in rates and foreign exchange. Strength in micro was supported by active secondary markets as expectations for inflation tempered and credit spreads tightened, driving an increase in client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly and primarily reflected lower revenues in the power and gas businesses. Other revenues included $356 million of mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale and loan hedges. These losses were substantially offset by net interest income and fees of $287 million.\nTurning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.4 billion and a record pretax profit of $6.6 billion, resulting in a PBT margin of 27%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $357 million, the PBT margin was 28.4%.\nFull year results reflect mark-to-market impacts of our deferred cash-based compensation plans, referred to as DCP. This negatively impacted our full year revenues by $858 million, with a corresponding decrease of $530 million in compensation expenses. As we have explained historically, there is typically a timing difference between the mark-to-market gains and losses on the economic hedges and the deferred recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period. The revenue and the expense impact of DCP is now included in our financial supplement.\nFourth quarter revenues were a record of $6.6 billion, and the PBT margin was 27.8%. Including integration-related expenses of $94 million, the PBT margin was 29.2%.\nTotal client assets were $4.2 trillion. Fee-based flows were $20 billion in the quarter, and asset management revenues were $3.3 billion. Net new assets of $311 billion in the year represents a 6.2% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $52 billion with contributions across channels.\nTransactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $931 million. Including the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 15% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower levels of overall retail engagement and fewer new issuance opportunities, partially offset by increased transactions related to fixed income products.\nBank lending balances grew by 17% in the year, or 13% -- or $17 billion in the year or 13%, and stand at $146 billion. The pace of lending growth slowed for the second consecutive quarter and was largely unchanged sequentially. While mortgages and tailored loans continue to grow slowly, this was offset by paydowns in securities-based lending due to the higher interest rate environment.\nTotal deposits rose 6% sequentially to $351 billion, driven by continued demand for our savings offering among our Wealth Management clients. We have seen success with our strategy to provide advisers with expanded tools needed to offer their clients choice in varied market environments. Further, the pace of sweep outflows also moderated in the quarter. As a result, we have a favorable deposit mix largely sourced from our Wealth Management client base with attractive pricing and options to meet our clients' needs.\nNet interest income was $2.1 billion in the quarter. The 52% increase from the prior year was driven by the benefits of the increased rate environment, an efficient deposit mix and strong lending growth over the last 12 months. Looking ahead, we do not believe that NII has peaked. We enter the year with an attractive deposit base with higher intrinsic value. While we expect the growth of NII to moderate from the pace of the last 2 quarters, we anticipate continued expansion in the first quarter of approximately 5% sequentially, assuming the forward curve is realized.\nInvestment Management reported full year revenues of $5.4 billion, declining 14% from the prior year. The challenging market backdrop led to lower accrued carried interest in several of our private funds. Also -- and also impacted our AUM, which declined to $1.3 trillion. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.5 billion. Long-term net outflows of $6 billion in the quarter were driven by equities and fixed income, reflecting the challenging public market backdrop, partially offset by demand for alternatives and solutions, particularly parametric customized portfolios, as well as our special situation strategies and private credit.\nFourth quarter asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, declining on the back of lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity revenues. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase versus the third quarter. Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $90 million. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternatives portfolio, though lower than the prior year. The diversification we gain from having fixed income, parametric customization and alternatives positions us well to perform through the cycle. We continue to invest in this business and leverage our premier global distribution capabilities to support future growth to meet continued global client demand.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs declined by $9 billion sequentially to $449 billion, reflective of our prudent management of resources. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.3%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Solid earnings, lower RWAs and gains in OCIs, partially offset by capital actions, contributed to our strong CET1 ratio.\nWe continue to execute our buyback program, and we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of common stock in the quarter.\nThe full year tax rate was 20.7% driven by the resolution of certain historic tax matters and the realization of certain tax benefits. We expect our 2023 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarterly volatility.\nThe firm's results demonstrate the ability of our business model to perform in an evolving environment. While there are, of course, uncertainties as we look ahead into 2023, we remain confident in the durability of the firm and the growth opportunities in the year ahead. Our combined $5.5 trillion of assets across Wealth and Investment Management provides us ballast. Importantly, our scale positions us well to capture the asset opportunity when the markets recover. Finally, while still very early in the year, we are encouraged by the levels of client engagement seen so far.\nWith that, we will now open the line to questions.",

Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.\nToday's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\n\nJames Patrick Gorman\n\nChairman & CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and I know we're starting a little later than some of the previous quarters, so I appreciate you staying with us. The firm performed well in a very uncertain and difficult environment. An ROTCE of 15%, excluding integration expenses, reflects the stability and strength of the business model.\nWealth Management pretax margin, excluding integration expenses, was 28.4%, and coupled with $65 billion of net new assets, demonstrates how this business, even in a very volatile market environment and with indices down over 20% this year, continues to attract new client assets and remains highly profitable. This business' enormous scale and channel diversification should ensure continued success.\nInvestment Management and Investment Banking were clearly impacted by the market environment. But as I've said elsewhere, advisory and underwriting activity has not gone away. It has simply been deferred. Fixed income and equities remains very solid with no areas of obvious concern. Both businesses navigated the complicated markets without serious incident.\nFinally, the strength of our capital position is very clear, as shown by the continuation of our strong buyback program with $2.6 billion of share repurchases in this past quarter, coupled that with a dividend yield north of 3% and a CET1 ratio of 14.8%. On an operating basis, this firm is doing well in a post-COVID world. From a markets perspective, we expect continued volatility as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy such to bring down inflation to acceptable long-term levels.\nThis is an environment where it behooves management to be prudent but balanced. A wholesale retreat from the market is not called for, but at the same time, one must be more cautious in credit-sensitive parts of the business. Fortunately, the business model changes for the past decade or more plus the acquisitions of Smith Barney, E*TRADE and Eaton Vance put us in a position of significant relative strength and should support solid absolute performance in the months ahead.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together, we'll take your questions.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13 billion in the quarter. Our EPS was $1.47, and our ROTCE was 14.6%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.53, and our ROTCE was 15.2%. We built our business model to perform through the cycle and withstand volatile environments, evidenced again by the performance this quarter.\nIn Institutional Securities, fixed income benefited from macroeconomic developments, and in Wealth Management, we continue to attract strong net new assets, underscoring the benefits of an advice-driven model and a variety of backdrops. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 71%, ensuring future growth remains a priority, and we continue to invest in tech-driven efficiencies.\nAnd with the abatement of COVID-related restrictions, marketing and business development expenses have progressively normalized as our teams reengage with clients and our colleagues in person. Efficiency remains an important performance objective and we review incremental spend on an ongoing basis.\nNow to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $5.8 billion, down from the robust prior year, but seasonally strong for -- seasonally strong rather, for a seasonally slower quarter relative to historical levels. Strength in fixed income and equities was a counterbalance to muted activity in Investment Banking.\nInvestment Banking revenues decreased year-over-year to $1.3 billion, with meaningful declines across products, particularly underwriting. Ongoing market volatility continued to weigh on issuance and led clients to delay strategic actions. Advisory revenues were $693 million. Solid results reflected the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Revenues were down relative to the record prior year and in line with broader M&A market volumes.\nEquity underwriting revenues were $218 million, with year-over-year declines across products, reflecting the overall volatility in global equity markets. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $366 million. Investment grade issuance fared better. Issuers took advantage of favorable windows, and investors demonstrated selectivity in a more challenging market.\nWe remain engaged with clients, and strategic dialogues are active across multiple industry groups. The eventual conversion to announcement is dependent on clarity around macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, growth and geopolitics as well as the stabilization of valuation. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion. The business performed well against the backdrop of equity market declines and volatility.\nPrime brokerage revenues decreased from last year. Results were impacted by lower average balances reflective of client deleveraging, which was partially offset by the mix of client balances. Cash and derivative results declined versus the prior year as client activity moderated. Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion represented the highest third quarter in over a decade, driven by strength across the macro complex.\nMacro revenues increased meaningfully versus the prior period. Inflationary pressure as well as central bank and fiscal activity drove volatility higher. By extension, changes in portfolios supported client engagement and increased flow trading activity, benefiting rates and foreign exchange.\nMicro revenues were in line with the prior year. Revenues favored the Americas more in the current period. Other revenues declined from the prior year and reflected a loss of $100 million. Mark-to-market losses on event and relationship loans, net of hedges and movements in revenues related to deferred cash-based compensation contributed to the decrease.\nTurning to Wealth Management. The business continues to deliver strong results despite the economic uncertainty. Revenues increased from the prior year to a robust $6.1 billion as we continue to grow the more stable parts of our firm. The rising rate environment supported net interest income, more than offsetting the lower asset management and transactional revenues.\nPretax profit was $1.6 billion, and the PBT margin was 26.9%. Excluding integration-related expenses, the PBT margin reached 28.4%, underscoring the resiliency of this business against the backdrop of declining asset values. Total net new assets were $65 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date net new assets to $260 billion.\nAsset consolidation from existing clients, net new clients, workplace relationships and positive net recruiting were all sources of strength. The growth of net new assets highlights the value of trusted advice, especially through periods of market uncertainty. Our platform continues to attract advisers who recognize the integral role of the Wealth Management business at the firm, and the value advisers gain by leveraging our technology and our products to best serve their clients.\nTransactional revenues of $616 million declined from the prior period due to lower retail engagement and the impact of movements in revenues related to deferred compensation plans. Asset management revenues of $3.4 billion primarily reflected lower market levels. Fee-based flows were $17 billion, moderating from the robust levels seen in recent quarters, suggesting retail hesitancy to invest in managed products in uncertain markets.\nBank lending balances grew to $146 billion. And on a year-to-date basis, balances have grown by $16 billion -- on a year-to-date basis -- rather, this quarter, balances have grown by $16 billion. The pace of loan growth slowed this quarter on the back of paydowns in securities-based lending and moderating mortgage growth. Total deposits declined by 2% in the quarter to $332 billion.\nThere was a shift in mix to higher-yielding saving products as our expanded bank offering attracted clients' investable cash. Net interest income was $2 billion, up nearly 50% from the prior year. In this accelerated rate hike cycle, we have outperformed our modeled beta across our deposit portfolio, which has more than offset the changing mix of our deposit base.\nThrough the end of the year, we would expect NII to remain broadly in line with the guidance provided last quarter, noting that some of the rate benefit was pulled forward into the third quarter. Despite this period of heightened uncertainty and volatility, we achieved consistent growth in Wealth Management. We continue to deliver strong net new assets and demonstrate economies of scale with considerable growth opportunities ahead.\nTurning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.2 billion declined from the prior period, substantially driven by lower asset values as well as the impact of outflows over the last year. Total AUM ended at $1.3 trillion. Long-term net flows were approximately $2 billion. While equity strategies continue to see outflows, the pace has moderated from recent quarters.\nInterest rate volatility negatively impacted fixed income flows. However, our broadened portfolio also delivered offsets. Inflows of $7 billion into our alternative and solutions platform were led by continued demand for Parametric customized portfolios and our direct indexing and tax-efficient investing capabilities as well as continued demand for private credit.\nLiquidity and overlay services had outflows of $32 billion. Clients likely relocated money market holdings to alternative risk-free assets. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower average AUM led to the year-over-year decline. Performance-based income and other revenues were a net loss of $101 million, primarily driven by the markdown of a single underlying public investment in one of our Asia private equity funds.\nInvestments in the business and the integration of Eaton Vance continue to progress well. We are investing in products and vehicles that will allow us to deliver solutions to a broader set of clients. Our strategic focus on secular growth areas such as alternatives and direct indexing, supported by our ability to globally distribute products, positions us well to perform through the cycle.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Standardized RWAs were relatively flat, ending the quarter at $460 billion. Prudent management of resources was partially offset by an increase due to market volatility. During the third quarter, we also bought back $2.6 billion of stock, taking advantage of our current valuation and utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization.\nOCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected unrealized losses of $1.3 billion. While this should be earned back over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 14.8%, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory requirement inclusive of buffers as of October 1.\nCapital remains critical to our strategy, particularly in this rapidly evolving backdrop. Our tax rate was 21.4% for the quarter, down from the third quarter of last year, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits. We now expect that our full year '22 tax rate will be approximately 22%.\nLooking ahead, the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. While we cannot be sure how the market dynamics will play out, we remain confident in our strategy, particularly our ability to aggregate client assets in Wealth Management, support our Institutional clients and deliver diversified solutions in Investment Management, all while prudently managing our capital profile and focusing on our strategic goals. With that, we will now open up the line to questions.",

Please enter your passcode followed by the pound or hash key.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\n400200\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your passcode is confirmed. Please wait while you are joined to the event.\nThank you for holding for the Morgan Stanley Live Earnings Conference Call. Please stay on the line, we'll begin momentarily.\nThank you for calling in for the Morgan Stanley Live Earnings Conference. We'll be going live shortly.\nGood morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded during today's presentation. We will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James Gorman.\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We started the second quarter with significant headwinds and uncertainties, and it's fair to say that we ended the quarter overall in a better place, with a better tone. The headwinds reflect the ongoing market transition from a high inflation, low rate environment to a higher rate, lower inflation environment. In addition, there were several other issues impacting the markets. April started on the heels of the first bank crisis since 2008, which had the risk of bleeding into the broader financial system. Prompt action by regulators and what turned out to be idiosyncratic stories of the failed banks, combined with the strength and support from the large U.S. banks, helped to rebalance the system.\nSecond, we found our country moving headlong into a debt ceiling crisis. While our view was it was likely to be resolved, there is no doubt it created unnecessary uncertainty in the markets in April and May. Thirdly, after rapidly rising rates over 15 months, the Fed reached a pause, if not a plateau, at its recent meeting. While we may not be quite at the end of rate increases, I believe we're very, very close to it. Finally, strong rhetoric from government leaders from both the U.S. and China in recent weeks is evident. But there's now been recent efforts to normalize relations, and a constructive dialogue is surely welcomed. Seeing these four not insignificant macro concerns, progress positively supported a more constructive tone in the markets, particularly evidenced in the last few weeks of the quarter.\nBeyond more macro issues, we at Morgan Stanley completed a significant part of the E*TRADE back office integration, with the final part to be completed after Labor Day, and we're very pleased with how it's gone. And today we announced new institutional initiatives with Japanese research and equity, and in foreign exchange with our long-standing partner MUFG, further evidence of how our businesses can work together over time to best serve our global clients. Importantly, we received the most recent results of CCAR. We're pleased our performance under the stress test has improved for the fourth consecutive year, every year since the ECB was introduced. Given our strong results, we increased our dividend by $7.50, the same as we did last year. That brings our total annual dividend per share to $3.40 annually, with a dividend yield of about 4% given the current stock price.\nAs to the financial performance of the firm this quarter, certain key metrics were encouraging. Net new assets in Wealth Management grew by $90 billion and combined with inflows from Investment Management, we saw over $100 billion, bringing our year-to-date net new assets to approximately $200 billion in six months. Our year-to-date growth is well ahead of pace and while obviously any quarter can bounce around and that will happen, our consistent growth in net new assets in Wealth Management is evidence of our scale, our expanded channels, and the clients that we serve. Second, our Institutional Businesses navigated a choppy environment well and altogether the firm delivered net revenues of over $13 billion, up 2% from last year when conditions were very different. This translated into an ROTCE of 12%.\nFinally, our CET1 Ratio was 15.5%. While we knew this would significantly exceed our capital requirements, and it did. It reflects our desire to remain highly capitalized in the face of the new unfolding Basel III Endgame. It's too early to predict the rate of market improvement through the rest of 2023, but the more positive tone and activity seen later in the quarter across many parts of our business is promising. Of course, how much it moves through the balance of the year remains unknown. That said, the fundamentals of our business model remain strong.\nFinally, a brief comment on succession at the annual meeting in May. I made it clear I would transition out of the CEO role before next year's annual meeting. Succession planning should be intentional and managed, just like strategic planning for the firm or any of our critical talent management processes. We are and have been dealing with a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the CCAR results, business environment, Basel III Endgame proposals, and certain other pending matters. I committed to the Board that I lead our response to those issues, and when I do transition out of the CEO role, I'll remain as Executive Chairman for a period of time. We are fortunate indeed to have three very strong internal candidates that the Board continues to evaluate along appropriate processes for their readiness to step up as the next CEO of Morgan Stanley.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail, and then together we'll take your questions. Thank you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.5 billion. Our EPS was $1.24 and our ROTCE was 12.1%. Reported results include severance charges of approximately $300 million. This reduced EPS by $0.14 and ROTCE by about 140 basis points. As James discussed, sentiment and activity improved towards the end of the quarter, evidenced by green shoots that emerged across our businesses. In institutional Securities, client engagement progressively picked up and in Wealth Management we witnessed a moderation of sweep outflows as well as a stabilization of retail investments into cash and cash equivalents. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. In addition to severance, expenses for the quarter included $99 million of costs associated with the integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, approximately 75% of which relates to E*TRADE.\nTogether, severance and this year's integration represent an impact of about 175 basis points to the year-to-date efficiency ratio for the balance of the year. Our expectations for total integration expenses are broadly in line with our prior guidance with approximately $150 million remaining. Looking towards the back half of 2023, we continue to balance investments with the operating environment. Now to the businesses, Institutional Securities revenues of $5.7 billion declined 8% versus last year with overall client activity. While overall client activity was lower compared to the prior period, results improved as the quarter progressed alongside better market conditions. Investment Banking revenues were flat compared to a year ago, although Advisory remained under pressure. A pickup in Underwriting supported results. Advisory revenues of $455 million reflected lower completed M&A volumes. Equity Underwriting revenues were $225 million, while IPO activity remained muted.\nResults were supported by follow-ons and convertibles, encouraging signs that equity and equity-linked markets were opened at times for regular way issuance. Fixed Income Underwriting revenues were $395 million, up year-over-year, driven mostly by investment-grade bond issuance where corporates and financials took advantage of constructive markets in May and June, respectively. Investment-Grade markets remain resilient against an uncertain backdrop across Investment Banking. Client activity trended positively as the quarter progressed. The preannounced M&A backlog grew consistently throughout the quarter with a potential plateau in rates and lower implied volatility. Client dialogue is currently active. We continue to invest in the franchise and have made selective senior hires to enhance our footprint to best position for the opportunity.\nWhile we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown and it is hard to know whether positive trends will continue for the near term, current conditions remain encouraging, certainly for the medium term outlook and especially for 2024.\nEquity revenues were $2.5 billion, down 14% compared to strong results in the previous second quarter due to lower activity and lower market volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were solid, supported by increasing average client balances consistent with rising market levels. Cash and Derivatives declined versus last year on lower global volumes and lower market volatility. Fixed Income revenues of $1.7 billion decreased compared to last year's elevated result. Solid performance reflects tempered client activity and prudent risk management. However, improved market conditions in June shifted client sentiment and supported the quarter's overall result. Macro revenues were down year over year, attributed to the declines in Foreign Exchange, a challenging environment, and reduced activity partially offset by the pickup in client engagement following the resolution of the debt ceiling debate and performance in rates. Micro results declined versus last year, predominantly on the back of lower client activity.\nResults in commodities were down significantly compared to the robust prior year, which benefited from volatile energy markets. Other revenues of $315 million improved versus last year, largely driven by lower mark-to-market losses net of hedges, higher net interest income, and fees on corporate loans held for sale. Turning to ISG lending and provisions, our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and Lending Commitments increased to $1.4 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $97 million. The increase was driven by continued negative outlooks for commercial real estate and modest portfolio growth. Net charge-offs were $30 million and were substantially all from a handful of specific loans from our corporate lending portfolio. Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $6.7 billion, a record excluding the impact of DCP. Revenues were $6.6 billion and increased 5% supported by higher net interest income.\nResults demonstrate the strength of the business model and our ability to continue to serve clients throughout different market environments. Pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion with a PBT margin of 25.2%. Severance charges were $78 million, and integration-related expenses were $75 million. Taken together and with the impact of DCP, these three factors were a drag on the margin of approximately 300 basis points. Despite the challenging market backdrop, the business model continued to deliver against our core objectives. Most notably, Wealth Management delivered $90 billion of net new assets, demonstrating our platform's ability to grow in various market environments. Net new assets were driven by our Advisor-led channel. Existing client consolidation and net recruiting were strong and offset seasonal tax-related outflows in April.\nOur early investments in technology, including data and AI, are providing advisors with tools to service current cloud clients better and more efficiently, prospect new business, including from our workplace channel. Also, significant as James mentioned, we are pleased to share that we have accomplished an integral part of E*TRADE's back office integration, converting over 3 million E*TRADE accounts to Morgan Stanley's unified platform. We did this with virtually no client disruption, which has always been a critical priority. We expect to finish our integration efforts on time in the second half of this year. Moving to our business metrics in the second quarter, performance was solid down the line in light of the environment. Asset management revenues were $3.5 billion, down 2% versus last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting lower market levels.\nTransactional revenues were $869 million, excluding the impact of DCP. Revenues declined 2% year-over-year, reflective of lower client activity. For most of the quarter, fee-based flows were $22.7 billion. Bank lending balances grew by $1.1 billion, driven by mortgages offsetting paydowns in securities-based lending. Total deposits of $343 billion were up slightly quarter-over-quarter. Sweep outflows moderated during May and June compared to April, which included seasonal tax outflows. The recent month trends are encouraging, but it remains too early to be declarative. Net interest income of $2.2 billion was virtually flat versus the prior quarter. The impact of lower sweep balances and higher funding costs were offset by higher rates. Looking towards the rest of the year, we do not expect NII to expand. Results will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of various rates.\nSimilar to the Institutional Business, Retail sentiment improved as the quarter progressed for the first time since the beginning of the year. June saw positive monthly flows into Equity Markets from Advisor-led suite balances. We are encouraged by this more recent activity and remain well positioned to support ongoing asset growth and our clients through market cycles. Turning to Investment Management, revenues of $1.3 billion declined 9% from the prior second quarter, primarily reflecting lower performance-based income and the cumulative impact of lower asset levels over the course of the year commensurate with the market environment. Asset Management and related fees were $1.3 billion, declining 3% year-over-year, reflecting the stability and diversification of our client franchise. Performance-based income and other revenues declined year-over-year due to the challenging investing environment in certain asset classes and markets such as real estate, and Asia Private Equity.\nSolid performance in other areas of our Private Alternative Strategies acted as a partial offset, reflecting the diversity of our platform and our capital-light client-driven alternative franchise. Total AUM increased $1.4 trillion. Our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. Integration-related expenses were $24 million in the quarter. Long-term net flows were positive. Inflows were driven by ongoing demand in alternatives and solutions, which offset outflows in Equities and Fixed Income. Within Alternatives and Solutions, Parametric customized portfolios, Private Credit, and Private Equity. Remain consistent sources of net inflows underscoring the benefits of our diverse platform.\nAdditionally, this quarter, alternatives and solutions benefited from a significant inflow related to a portfolio solutions mandate. Liquidity and Overlay services had inflows of $9.7 billion supported by ongoing demand for money market funds. We continue to be very well positioned in secular growth areas such as customization and private markets across geographies and with our global client base. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets decreased $35 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 Ratio was 15.5%, up approximately 40 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs declined about $9 billion from the prior quarter to $450 billion due to market conditions and continued prudent resource management.\nRecent stress test results reaffirmed our strong capital position and our durable business model. We announced a quarterly dividend increase of $7.50 and renewed our $20 billion multiyear repurchase authorization. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter, reflecting our global mix of earnings. While we outperformed our tax guidance in the first half, we expect a tax rate of approximately 23% in the second half of this year, consistent with our initial guidance. Although we cannot be sure how the backdrop will play out for the rest of 2023, our priority as a management team is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities. Should stable and higher asset levels prevail, Wealth and Investment Management are poised to benefit, particularly as we continue to attract net new assets, a testament to our asset growth strategy within Institutional Securities.\nWhile Advisory will lag the financing markets, the backlog is building and underwriting trends are positive. Open and functioning markets remain key to supporting client conviction and activity levels. Most critically, our business continues to advance our clear and consistent firm strategy driving long-term growth while remaining well capitalized. With that, we will now open the line up to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are now ready to take in questions. To get in the queue, you may press star and the number one on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please please press star and the number two on your touchtone telephone. You are allowed to ask one question and one follow up and then we'll move to the next person in the queue. Please stand by while we compile the Q &A roster.\nWe'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you and good morning.\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nI guess maybe first question, James, for you. Thanks for the update on the succession. As we think about what you built in terms of the franchise and I think you talked about the unfolding Basel III Endgame rules that are expected over the next week or two. From a shareholder perspective, do you see these rules as game-changing where investors will have to reevaluate the value proposition of Morgan Stanley as a franchise and you as a management team would have to review strategic targets that you've laid out? Give us a sense and I know plenty of unknowns, but I think the question we get from shareholders is the comfort around the ability of the firm to manage through what could be pretty radical changes.\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, you know, it's an important question and you're right, I have made comments on it. Let's sort of set the table of where we are right now. We've had a lot of speculation based off of what the Basel III Endgame looks like. By the way, I'm not sure it's actually being implemented fully in Europe. Just to say it, I think the U.S. banks actually have more capital. But putting that nit aside, we did get the speech from the Vice Chair. I think it's important to look at the title of that speech, which was Holistic Capital Review. So it's taking into account all of the CCAR stress tests, SCB buffers, and the like as this stuff is implemented. Secondly, we haven't seen the actual rules. I mean, I guess there'll be a proposal coming out, as you said, in a couple of weeks.\nThere will be an extensive comment period. There is clearly very different views as to the need for the U.S. banking system to accrete more capital. In fact, if you look at the tests of the last few years, what happened with the regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank, Signature Bank, what happened during COVID, what's happened during this period of high inflation, what's happened with the biggest rate increase we've had in 40 years, put all that together. The U.S. large banks actually did really well. In fact, if not all of them, certainly for Morgan Stanley, our capital position improved four years in a row under CCAR. So it's kind of hard for me to sit here and say that we won't be commenting.\nForcefully, that we are very well capitalized, but there will be an extensive comment period. I suspect what comes out of that will not be the same as what starts. I think in the sausage making there will be a lot of evaluation. Clearly, the intent is not to harm the U.S. banking system, which is the backbone of the economy. It's to strengthen us. Then there'll be a long transition period. So, you know, I just happen to be reading the speech from the Vice Chair in the last couple of days, and he had a paragraph in there anticipating this question. I thought I'd read to you. Any proposed changes would go through the standard notice and comment rulemaking process, allowing for all interested parties appropriate time. Any final changes to capital requirements would occur with appropriate transition times.\nHe goes on again later in his speech to point out it could be it will not be fully effective for some years. So here we are in 2023. I don't think this is going to happen in any meaningful way before the end of 2026. I think what comes out a year from now after comment period will be very different from what goes in. Just take my personal peeve in it, which is applying a standardized RWA hit on operational risk as the various regulators try and figure out what the right way to assess operational risk capital is. And to put a standard, I said, is fine. But to do it based on fee income, which is the current European proposal, seems to me to be nuts. I mean we're not. You don't build fee-based businesses to create operational risk.\nYou build them to create stability. So that's a point we've made very clear with the regulators, and I think they're taking it under consideration. So long story short, yes, it's the final thrust. It's ironic. I don't believe all the European Banks are complying with their own rules. We have a very healthy, robust capital system here that's been tested 12 years in a row. Morgan Stanley has done well, and there is no chance there'll be a major strategic shift for Morgan Stanley as a result of any of this, is my conclusion.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThat was helpful and nuts. Sounds about right. One quick question, Sharon, for you. You mentioned NII not seen as expanding from here. I guess is implied in their expectation that NII should stabilize in the back half, give or take, within a few percentage points?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nIt will depend, really. Ebrahim, thanks for the question. Really depend on the deposit mix. And so as I mentioned, there were encouraging signs in terms of that mix if we think about the back half of the quarter. But that liability mix, what's going on with sweeps will be the primary driver when you think about NII in the near term.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nDirector of Financial Technology Research, JMP Securities\n\nThanks. Good morning. I just want to touch on the Institutional Securities and you had ultimately, I think, a pretty good quarter relative to the backdrop. You mentioned that engagement.\nReally accelerated kind of towards the back half of the quarter. So I'm assuming kind of on the other side of the debt ceiling debate, things started to normalize a little bit. So just want to talk about some of the puts and takes and whether, you know, maybe the second quarter results, which are still the softest results I think since 2019 second quarter, this is kind of a more normal outcome or if you actually think that what you saw kind of in that recovery in the back half of the quarter is normalization. And so therefore, you know, we could actually bounce back from the outcome of the second quarter? Thanks.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. Let's take all of ISG first. So when we think about what we discussed a lot at length, really, about normal post-COVID has been for the overall ISG wallet to land between 2019 and 2020. Our view there broadly has not changed in terms of where we expect ourselves to be. But we've laid out pretty clear sort of market share guidelines in terms of where we are from a wallet perspective. When you look specifically, you talked about Fixed Income. We've moved from 6% wallet share to 10% wallet share. So I think the dramatic change that we've made in that business has really been around a client-centric franchise and making sure that we're there to be able to service our client base.\nWhat we talked about as you highlight is that there was less client activity for us this second quarter compared to last year's second quarter. But interestingly, as you mentioned and you're right, we saw a dramatic change in that activity level specifically in Fixed Income right after the debt ceiling debate. So I think what we're looking to do is capture our fair share of the wallet. And that overall wallet, in terms of normalization, we think will likely land between 2019 and 2020.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nDirector of Financial Technology Research, JMP Securities\n\nOkay, great color there. And then, just in terms of just this green shoot and normalization theme, we are seeing in the Equity Capital Markets, Debt Capital Markets, some normalization. M&A still been pretty lackluster. And so just curious whether you just feel like maybe that's more on a lag basis as capital markets recover than M&A recovery would come next or is there something else kind of idiosyncratic to that market that may hold back results in that business? Thanks.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Remember that of course Advisory is always going to be lagged just because of the announcements. So we're digesting the fact that we had very muted or a dearth of announcements. If we look back six, nine months, if we think about the last month of the quarter, we began to see more announcements, and we're seeing that really in sectors specific that have strategic dialogue around them. So be that financials where you might see industry consolidation, energy where you're seeing transitional discussions and reasons to actually have strategic dialogue. So what gives us confidence is that you're seeing a broadening out of those strategic dialogues. Our backlog is building, and we're seeing it across various sectors. We're having both backlog and discussions.\nBut it is fair to say that Advisory will likely lag simply because you are dealing with a lagged announcement pipeline from the last six to nine months.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. Thank you. So I want to drill down a little bit more on the $90 billion. I know it can be lumpy but I didn't think it was 2-2 workplace produced. I wonder if you could drill down a little bit on what happened to work so well this quarter in this first half of the year. I mean it bodes well for your doubling of pre-tax margin. I'm sorry, doubling of pre-tax income for wealth. But just curious on what's contributing to the good lumpiness lately? Obviously well ahead of your trillion every three-year pace.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you so much, Glenn, for the question. Yes, I think referencing Andy's speech that he gave, for those of you who may not be aware, is helpful because it is an asset-led strategy. When we think about where we see expansion in that business going forward this particular quarter, you know, historically over the long term we've generally said no one channel is contributing to over 25% of NNA. Interestingly, this quarter, we did see the Advisor-led channel. It was a big proponent. And more than that, it was what was a big production. Part of the funnel was the assets held away from existing clients. That's been a strategy that we've been talking about back 2015 through 2018 or so.\nWe put out a number of tools, the Modern Wealth Toolkit, et cetera, to give advisors more time to begin to not only prospect new clients, but also really offer their existing clients better advice. So that's where I think you're beginning to see a lot of that work in terms of aggregating assets held away. We continue to believe that that's a real opportunity for us to grow our asset base.\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nI just want to add on this a little bit because it's obviously been a focus of mine for many decades. The run rate, Glenn, as you know, for the three years before this was $1 trillion. So we're running about $330 billion in a year. This year run rate, if you extended, would obviously be higher than that. It'd be around $400 billion. But I think you're right, it's going to be lumpy. I mean, you're going to have a quarter in here somewhere. That's a $50 billion quarter and I wouldn't get too excited about that. And just as I don't get too excited, we're ahead of the run rate. What I really care about, what I'm really excited about is it's a real thing. This is not. This is not just something that's going to stop. We've got a lot of wealthy clients.\nJust the dividends, the interest they get on their accounts, the money they bring in, the migration from the workplace, the migration from the E*TRADE accounts, it's the real deal. And you know, I know we put out this $10 trillion number, which I think is. I think, you know, this is going to happen. And at a 5%. Increase in the value annually on the portfolio with a trillion every three years. It happens in a bit over five years. You know, it's just a pretty much unstoppable force. But there will be lumpiness in it, I'm sure of that. I don't know when, but there will be lumpy. This happened to be a great one. You know, I'm excited about it. I think, you know, we're heading to.\nWe're clearly heading to 10 trillion, which is at 50 basis points, $50 billion in revenue. If you do the math, compounding, and I know people are going to call me crazy and I know it's the end of my 10 years so I get to do this kind of stuff. But if you do 5% over 14 years, you end up at 23%, which is $100 billion revenue business. Well, that seems like a long way out, but I started this job 14 years ago and we had much, much fewer than the $6.3 trillion we have today. So it's possible.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nWow. Maybe just one quickie. Sharon, you talked about sweeps, and it's too early to tell if we've settled in. I'm curious if you have any stats you can share on what percentage of FAs and or what percentage of clients have accounted for most of the moving. I'm not sure what to root for here, but curious on how widespread across the FA and client base the shifts have been or concentrated.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, in terms of the shifts, in terms of moving out of sweeps into savings or seeing savings products, we still have over 80% of our actual deposit base, is coming from our own client base. What's interesting in terms of the movement of sweeps, which might be your question, I'm not sure I'm totally answering it, Glenn, is that we began to see some of those sweeps, not just remember we used to see them move into money markets or other cash alternatives. In June, we began to see some of those dollars actually move into markets, so various assets. We hadn't seen that trend since January. So that just shows that some of the clients are actually also deploying excess cash or cash equivalents actually into the marketplaces.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our next question, we'll move to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Head of Financials Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning. So, James, I appreciate your comments on Basel III Endgame. Might be helpful if you could just speak to how the lengthy transition period informs your near-term buyback appetite, if at all. And given the RWA inflation could be quite meaningful. What are some of the mitigating actions you can pursue to alleviate some of the pressure on your businesses?\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, again, I think, Steve, we've got to see the rule proposed first. Without talking out of school, I've clearly had conversations with all the appropriate regulatory bodies and I'm encouraged by their response, which is they sincerely want to hear comments from the industry. They do understand. You know, capital changes across the whole industry.\nHave to result in the right economic outcome for the country. And by definition, the bank stability, as evidenced by the recent many years of CCARs, shows that the G-SIB banks, the top eight banks for sure, are well capitalized. So I don't want to get ahead and talk about what we'd mitigate. Clearly we have flexibility around our RWAs. You saw that this quarter we ended up with 15.5% CET1. You know, we did that. Not really from a Basel III perspective. I mean, we had that in the back of our mind, but more from, you know, this environment. It was a little, it was a little squirrely. I mean, let's just say that, you know, you had three bank fails at the beginning of the quarter that wasn't a good look. So we wanted to be cautious.\nOn the specific buyback, obviously just on the dividend, you know, we're totally comfortable with the dividend. We've said many, many times to regard half the company's a yield stock and we're going to treat it that way. The dividend increases you've seen, I think they're entirely appropriate and I would expect they continue over coming years, without saying exactly what level they're at. On the buyback, I mean, we will take advantage of weakness in the stock. We will be prudent. We're accreting, you know, this was a very difficult quarter and we accrued $2 billion. So it's not like we're not making money here. You know, I'd like to see the rule, I guess in a couple of weeks. Sharon. Right. We're getting the rule and then the first range of comments. We'll be doing buybacks through this year.\nWe have $20 billion authorization from the board. We won't be doing $20 billion, but you know, we'll be doing buybacks and we'll moderate it. I think this thing is going to take. As I said, I'd be surprised if this is all done and dusted by. Where are we? 2023. By the end of 2026. I think that's sort of. That's three and a half years, which is a lifetime in these industries.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Head of Financials Research, Wolfe Research\n\nNo, it's a fair point, James. I mean, admittedly we all had the experience with Basel III when it wasn't going to get fully implemented for a period of years and the impacts were fully loaded. So I think we're all just trying to prepare for maybe some expectation that it gets priced in a little bit more quickly?\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nIt could, it could. You know, we'll adapt, but we won't change our strategy. I'm going to be a strong advocate on where I think some of these rules do not align with what is right for the global, for the U.S. financial system and the US economy, not just Morgan Stanley's self interest.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Head of Financials Research, Wolfe Research\n\nNo helpful perspective. If I could squeeze in one more here just on investment management, the 30% margin goal that you've laid out for Wealth and IM Wealth, when we adjust for the specials of about 300 basis points, you're within spitting distance of that 30% the Investment Management margin. It's running in the mid teens, and I recognize you're still integrating Eaton Vance, but what are your margin aspirations for that business and what are some of the actions you're taking to maybe help close that gap?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo Steve, the margin goals that we've given have been really around Wealth Management. I respect your point though. We have given larger efficiency targets for the firm, and so there are places where you know, all puts and takes between ISG and IM. Remember if we look back less than 18 months ago or so we did, we were close to 30% margins in the IM business. So what we've seen over the course of the last year or so has just been the cumulative impact of the outflows associated with changes in what investor appetite was, particularly around active equity, but also just the asset levels themselves that are associated with market. What's important to us is the diversification of the platform and then continuing to invest in where we see real structural changes in that business.\nI mean by that business, I mean more broadly in an industry landscape. So things like customization consistently every quarter, regardless of what we've seen sort of on the top line, we continue to see increased flows, net inflows on the customization products you saw, you know, we talked about a solutions based product this additional quarter. So we're leaning into where we see industry opportunities, and as we grow assets similar to us growing assets on the Wealth Management side, that should help support the margin for the investment management business, which we do see as a through the cycle business.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMaybe we go to the next one and come back to Brennan.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to the next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Banking Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Well, this is the first chance we have to ask you about the CEO change, James. And you know, just why.\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nMike you asked me about the CEO change in 2012. That's second chance you ask me.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Banking Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, well you. You know, you survived and thrived so there you go.\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, I appreciate that.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Banking Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nBut it's yes, this is Wall Street, and what have you done for us lately and what's going to happen ahead. So, first, I don't understand what executive chairman is, and I do hope you have in-person shareholder meetings again, like you did in the past. And what will that mean when you're an executive chairman? And what is your thought process on timing of the new CEO and what are your considerations? I mean, we can all go through, you know, the candidates that we see in the press, but let's just hear from you directly what you're thinking and what the board's thinking. Who ultimately makes that decision?\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell. To take a few of those pieces, we're not going to have in-person shareholder meetings. In the years I did this before COVID, we have more people from security than we did shareholders physically in the meeting. So let's just be honest, it was an enormous waste of time and money. And while, you know, one or two people might ask, like asking a question in person, I just don't think it's a good use of time and money. But that, along with my pet peeve that we shouldn't have quarterly earnings reports, they should be every six months. That's two immediate changes I would make if I was God of finance. But that's not what you really asked about on the CEO stuff. I mean, Mike, you know, I said about five years ago, I'd step down about five years.\nI said three years ago to be three years, and nobody believed me. So I said the best way to get people to believe and the board agreed with this strategy was at the annual meeting to say I won't be in the job of the next annual meeting. So that makes it very clear. It's 12 months. We're already two months into it. When exactly that happens, frankly, just isn't that relevant. I mean, whether it happens tomorrow, it happens on May 15th or something, next annual meeting isn't relevant. It'll happen somewhere between those dates. There's a few things I think just given my tenure I could probably get done that will help the new CEO get off to a great start. And that is my intent.\nI want somebody to do this job, as you know, well, better than I've done it for the next several years and to thrive in it. And the best way to help them is to get them off to a good start. So the exact timing will be just driven by that. Obviously, given the questions here on Basel III Endgame, that's an important thing for me to dig into over the next few months. We just got the CCAR stuff done. We got the dividend done. We're chipping away at what I call the remaining pieces. The board will ultimately decide. We have a process. It's a committee. The Comp Management Development, and Succession Committee, chaired by Dennis Nally, runs that process. It reports to the board, obviously, and the poor board will ultimately choose the next CEO.\nAnd I'm sure at some point they'll want my formal input on that. But they're doing their process as they should, independently, and I think it's very healthy. So the criteria you look for, obviously not necessarily who's the best business operator running a given business on a given day, but who's best equipped to deal with the multiple constituencies and challenges of running a global bank. And that's what the board will figure out. So saying more than that, I think would be inappropriate because it gets ahead of the board's process and that's their job. And I'm just here to help along the way. So hopefully that clarifies it Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Banking Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, just one follow up. So, at least I guess there's three contenders, the three heads, the business lines, if that's correct. And, you know, I guess that means maybe two people don't get the job. What's a good technique for your firm or any firm to make sure that those people who don't get the top job are still made part, still stay with the firm, and feel a part of everything that's happening?\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWall Street's had a history of that not happening. I think we will, frankly, we will challenge that history. We have an unbelievable team. They've worked together for at least eight years. I think they've all been on the operating committee, and we have an unbelievable team of executives around them. Sharon, who you're hearing on this call? Eric Grossman, our chief legal officer, Clare Woodman, who runs Europe, Middle East, and so on and so on. So we have a lot of very talented executives. You know, that'll be for myself, frankly, to help navigate that path. But these jobs are enormous jobs, whether CEO or president or COO of these global companies. And you know, we're one of the largest companies in the world, so I'm confident we'll end up in a great place Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nHopefully you can hear me now.\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes, Brennan,\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nAll right. Sorry about that before. So, Sharon, I know you mentioned before about the NII and the deposit cost having a big impact, but actually the deposit cost trends were roughly in line with what we were looking for. And yet NII turned out to be a little better than expected. Could you tell us? We don't have great visibility on the asset side. Did something happen on the asset side? Were you able to reprice some assets, and how much more do we have potentially on the come?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThere were some places where we benefited from the asset side, but as you know, we'll have to look at the ALM mix and it will be dependent on some of the market rates that we see going forward. So unfortunately there's not that much more clarity I can give you other than what is leading us as we go forward is largely that liability mix. And so that's the trend that will, when we look out in the next couple of quarters is one of the biggest trends that will drive NII from here.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, thanks for that. Then I noticed, I know it can diverge sometimes, but the trends for firm-wide NII were different, down about $300 million quarter-over-quarter. So could you help us maybe understand why it was that the firm-wide NII differed substantially from the Wealth Management trends?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes, that was largely just associated with the trading position. As you know, it depends on many things including what products you have, where they're booked, how they're booked, and what type of instrument, and in addition various types of funding costs. It's really the, I think when we look and we manage the business specifically on the trading side, given our portfolio and how we think about our bank versus just the broader broker-dealer, et cetera. We don't manage it on an NII basis. When we're looking at NII, NII is clearly a driver from the wealth management side.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Another question on wealth and acknowledging the strong NNA number in aggregate, but what do you think we need to see for the fee-based NNA to begin to get closer in size to the total NNA, and maybe what you think longer-term that mix will look like?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat question. We've looked a lot at fee based and thought about sort of as we think about the funnel, one thing that we highlighted to you last year or last quarter rather, was that from the Advisor-led side we still had around 23% of those assets in cash and cash equivalents, that is a historical average of the last five years is around 18%. So in our mind a lot of it has to do with the way that people are looking at the markets right now and the idea that when you're moving into a fee based asset, specifically on the retail side you are doing so and you're actually obviously actively investing in different market assets.\nAnd so what is encouraging is, as I highlighted on, I think, to the question Glenn asked, that in the last month of the quarter we began to see individual retail clients actually put that money into markets. So that's an encouraging sign. But we do think that a portion of that is market dependent.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, Sharon. Can you give us some color? When the E*TRADE deal was closed, I think it was back in October 2020, one of the real attractions I think for Morgan Stanley was the workplace channel. And you guys are obviously a dominant player in this workplace channel. Are there any metrics that you can share with us on the success you're having in increasing the penetration in that channel?\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nEVP and CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes, we've talked a lot in the last two quarterly updates around just the movement that we see in terms of channel migration, is what we've called it. So workplace assets that are then some portion of it is moved into the Advisor-led side. And then from that sort of as a core, you see assets held away, beginning to come in. For the first three years that we had that, that number was around $150 billion. So call it $50 billion a quarter. And then in the first quarter of this year, we were, for that one quarter, we saw $28 billion. And when you look at the first half, we're largely running almost up to a full year rate of last year. And so what that puts into account is we are seeing encouraging signs.\nWe don't know exactly where that number will land, but obviously it's trending in a good direction. What it shows again is that workplace can begin to be sort of a seed to the conversation that people have with Advisors. You see that being 10, 20% of the assets that are brought in through the migration. The other 80% or so are coming in from assets held away.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. And then, James, just to circle back to the capital comments that you made with the Basel III Endgame, and we've heard from some of your peers about the engagement with the regulators appears to be stronger this time, maybe than in past. Can you share with us your feelings when you think about what you guys all went through post the financial crisis and the new regulations that came from Dodd-Frank? Do you think the regulators are really listening to you folks more so this time than in the past, or is that not the case?\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Well, I think, Gerard, you know, it's early. We need to see the rule. There's one thing to listen and there's another thing to listen and act. The test is once the regulatory community receives feedback from the industry groups, which are very coordinated, I will say. You know, what input do they take into account? Frankly, how do we compare, you know, what the European Banks have done on their own regulations? So I think bringing the U.S. to sort of a gold plated European standard just doesn't feel to me like the right end outcome. I think we should do what's right for the U.S. financial system. Yes, I think they're listening.\nThey've shown an interest in, a strong interest in getting the feedback from the industry, the communities, the legislative bodies, et cetera. So. But you know, the proof will be in the pudding. We'll find out over the next. I don't know how long it'll take, the comment period. I'm assuming it could be a year or so. I mean this is a big deal. Remember Basel III Endgame, first proposed in 2017. So it's taken us six years to, you know, make its way in a small sailing boat across the Atlantic and here it is. So now we've got to decide what we like about what we don't. So, you know, I'm maintaining constructive tone because I think everybody wants to end up in the right place.\nI don't happen to think, and this is contrary to some people's views, that the Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank have a whole lot to do with this stuff. But you know, that's a different discussion for a later day. So yeah, I would hope and expect that they're going to listen because we should be listening to each other.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our next question we'll move to Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Lim\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Societe Generale\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to circle back again on Basel III as well. So I note your comments about European Banks having maybe a bit more work to do. A lot of them are guiding towards impacts on a quantitative basis at the low end though, sort of like below 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you saw something a bit more specific that might level the playing field for the European Banks versus U.S. banks debate, and then turning over to the U.S. banks. Obviously we're all familiar with the large impacts that have been talked about by Jerome Powell and Michael Barr.\nOne of your competitors was a bit more forthcoming, saying that that might allude to operational risk-weighted assets being added to total standardized risk-weighted assets, which currently isn't the case under the standardized approach. So I was wondering if you had any like specific thoughts about that or whether you thought that was a bit more. A bit less relevant given that that would allude to legacy RMBS losses from many years ago. How do you think about that?\n\nJames Gorman\n\nChairman and CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, I'm not going to go into more detail about the European banks. I was just observing that the system was set up many years ago under Basel. The European Banks, some of which are fully compliant with it and some are not yet, and the country system was set up in the U.S. of CCAR. So we've actually had a capital stress test system for at least, I don't know, 12 years or something. So that was simply the observation on the operational risk standardized approach to risk-weighted assets. Yes, actually that is very clearly going to be in the proposal. That is the Basel III proposal, and that is going to be in the initial readout I think from the U.S. proposal where that ends up.\nI've made my position very clear on that. Tying standardized RWAs to fee-based business is not, just doesn't make sense to me. So up until now we've had idiosyncratic evaluation of specific bank operational risk, and the regulators are trying to move to a standardized approach. How they get there, when we get there, remains a lot to be seen. A lot of work to be done on that.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers.\nThis call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.\nToday's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release.\nThis presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\n\nJames Patrick Gorman\n\nChairman & CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're doing the call a little differently this time. I'm in London, Sharon is in New York. So if we have any logistical gaps for a second or two, please understand, but I think we'll be just fine.\nThe firm delivered a very solid quarter against, obviously, what is a more challenging backdrop. Our businesses proved resilient, reflecting an important aspect of our strategy, and that is to, as we've said many times, deliver stable performance in a difficult environment while remaining well capitalized.\nThe integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance continued to expand our opportunities to reach new clients, grow assets and support the firm's overall stability.\nNet new assets in Wealth Management of over $50 billion, despite the volatility and clients tax-related withdrawals in the quarter, underscored the scale of our business and its power to attract assets. And in the face of a sharp decline of equity markets, Wealth Management delivered a strong PBT and improved margin, supported by the benefits of rising rates.\nInvestment Management benefited from its diversification, and we saw continued momentum in private alternatives, parametric customized portfolios and the countercyclicality of our money market business.\nFinally, in Institutional Securities, our strong franchise in equity and fixed income helps materially counter what everybody knows to be limited activity across Investment Banking.\nOur results this quarter also reflected two notable headwinds that are worth calling out. First, we saw a significant movement in the investments related to deferred cash-based compensation plans.\nWhile the marks on these investments are substantially offsetting compensation expense, they created a significant drag on top line revenues in the quarter across the firm, particularly in Wealth Management, where the impact of revenues exceeded $500 million.\nSecondly, the quarter results also included the legal costs of $200 million that reflects the likely resolution of regulatory investigations by the SEC and the CFTC regarding employees' use of unapproved personal devices and the firm's record-keeping requirements. This has been the subject of industry-wide scrutiny.\nOur ROTCE, excluding integration expenses for the deals that we've done, was 14.3%, down 20% in Q1 and from last year. As I said at the outset, our objective to demonstrate resilience and balance in a more difficult economic cycle was achieved this quarter, helped in part by the acquisition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance in what was otherwise a challenging environment.\nFinally, the Fed stress test further affirmed our differentiated business model. Our diversified business mix as well as our strong capital position provide us the flexibility to invest for future growth and support our robust capital return program. As such, we increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and announced a $20 billion multiyear buyback program.\nHaving a dividend that's aligned to the more stable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management is a leading priority of this firm. And by the way, today's stock price, the current dividend, has a yield of approximately 4%.\nWith the buyback, we wanted more flexibility than an annual fixed commitment allows. Given the nature of our business model, it's especially appealing to have this additional flexibility to deploy capital at what we believe to be attractive valuations.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sharon. And as always, at the end, we'll take your questions.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.1 billion in the second quarter. Our EPS was $1.39, and our ROTCE was 13.8%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.44 and our ROTCE was 14.3%. Our results reaffirm the stability of the franchise against a challenging backdrop and the benefits of a balanced business model.\nThe integrated investment bank continues to serve clients' evolving needs in a dynamic environment. Wealth Management benefited from its scale and rising rates. Despite the decline in global asset prices, our expanded product set in Investment Management proved supportive to that business.\nThe firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio, excluding integration-related expenses, was 70%. This includes the $200 million legal matter related to the firm's record-keeping requirements that James discussed.\nGiven the broader market uncertainty and inflationary environment, we are focused on discretionary spend while balancing continued investment initiatives and ensuring the right controls are in place to support future growth.\nAs a management team, our priority is to diligently address what we can control, given the market realities. We will continue to review incremental spend as we regard efficiency as a critical performance objective.\nNow to the businesses. Institutional revenue of over $6 billion demonstrates the power of our balanced franchise against the difficult market backdrop. Revenues declined from the exceptionally strong prior year, while the backdrop was challenging for Investment Banking, particularly underwriting. Fixed income and equities led the strength of the quarter as clients navigated volatile markets.\nInvestment Banking revenues were $1.1 billion, down significantly from the prior year. Heightened volatility led clients to delay strategic actions and new issue activity. Advisory revenues were $598 million, reflecting lower completed M&A volumes.\nEquity underwriting revenues declined to $148 million. Results were in line with global equity volumes, which fell meaningfully versus the prior year.\nFixed income underwriting revenues were $326 million, also down compared to the prior year as bond issuance was muted across both investment-grade and non-investment-grade companies.\nThe Investment Banking pipeline remains solid. Conversion to realize will largely be dependent on market conditions and corporate confidence. Equity revenues were $3 billion, reflecting the strength of our business against a volatile backdrop.\nPrime brokerage revenue...\n(technical difficulty)\n\nOperator\n\nPlease standby as we reconnect our speakers. Please continue.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nOur revenues declined versus the prior year and reflected a loss of $413 million. Mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale, including event loans, offset by gains on hedges, were $282 million. This reflected the widening of credit spreads.\nNotable declines in deferred-based -- in deferred cash-based compensation plans, compared to gains in the prior year, also contributed to the decline.\nTurning to ISG lending. As a reminder, over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are either investment-grade or secured. Our Institutional Securities Group credit portfolio continues to perform well. Our funded ratio on corporate loans stands at approximately 11%, in line with prepandemic levels and well below the first quarter 2020 peak of approximately 25%.\nTurning to Wealth Management. By several measures, performance was strong despite the volatile backdrop. We reported revenues of $5.7 billion. Results were meaningfully impacted by movements in DCP, which reduced revenues by $515 million in the quarter.\nExcluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 6% from the prior year to $6.3 billion, a new record. The decline in DCP was substantially offset by a reduction in compensation expense.\nExcluding integration-related expenses, PBT was robust at $1.6 billion, and the margin increased to 28.2%. The margin resilience in a turbulent market environment serves as evidence of the strength of the franchise and the benefits of our business mix, including the growth of our banking offerings.\nTransactional revenues were $291 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 17%. Lower revenues reflect a moderation of client activity from last year's elevated levels and limited new issuance.\nSelf-directed daily average trades remained well above E*TRADE's pre-acquisition highs. Asset management revenues of $3.5 billion were up modestly versus the prior year, driven by strong fee-based flows, realized over recent quarters.\nFee-based flow assets were $29 billion in the quarter, and fee-based assets now represent 50% of our adviser-led assets.\nTotal net new assets were $53 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date NNA to $195 billion, representing a 6% annualized growth rate. Tax outflows were roughly double that of recent second quarter. And yet asset generation remains strong and balanced.\nNNA was driven by existing and new clients in the adviser-led channel, stock plan vesting events, positive net recruiting and self-directed channel inflows.\nBank lending balances grew $7 billion in the quarter, driven by securities-based lending and mortgages. We continue to expect full-year loan growth of $22 billion.\nDeposits declined $12 billion in the quarter to $340 billion. The decline was associated with seasonal tax outflows and the deployment of rate-sensitive cash. The outflows were largely in line with our expectations.\nThe average rate of deposits increased to 28 basis points. This was driven by an increase in savings account rates and deposit mix.\nNet interest income was $1.7 billion, up notably from the prior year, driven by higher rates and continued strong bank lending growth.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, NII is now a more reasonable exit rate, going forward. While the magnitude of rate hikes is not certain, if the forward curve is realized and our model assumptions materialize, we estimate $500 million of incremental NII to be spread over the upcoming two quarters, weighted towards the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Investment Management. Revenues were $1.4 billion. Against the challenging public market environment, our results demonstrate the benefits of our diversified product mix, particularly with strength in our portfolio solutions, led by Parametric customization and private alternative funds as well as our liquidity offering.\nWe've built a portfolio that provides balance across various market environments. The benefits of these efforts were apparent in the quarter. Total AUM was $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of $3.5 billion primarily reflect recurring headwinds in equity strategies, where we are partially offset by strong demand in alternatives and solutions, particularly in Parametric customized portfolios.\nCollaboration with our Wealth Management business as well as other U.S. wealth management platforms is a driver of strength of our customized offerings.\nLiquidity net inflows exceeded $30 billion. We have invested in our liquidity business in the past decade, which has positioned our franchise well to benefit from the current rising rate environment. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower AUM was partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue as rates came off of a zero bound.\nPerformance-based income and other revenues were $107 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternative portfolio, with particular strength in infrastructure and the energy sector investment. The decline versus the prior year was driven by movements in DCP and markdowns on public investments.\nOverall, our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. We have seen early success in leveraging our global distribution across our combined businesses.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets declined 4% from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs notably decreased to $461 billion from the prior quarter as we manage our exposure efficiently across our businesses amid a market decline. The result was a reduction in RWAs of $40 billion.\nOCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected an increase of unrealized losses of $1.1 billion. While this should be earned back over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter.\nOur supplementary leverage ratio was 5.4%. During the second quarter, we completed our $12 billion buyback plan that we announced last year. The most recent stress test results further reaffirmed our durable business model, and we announced a dividend increase of 11% and a $20 billion multiyear repurchase authorization.\nLooking ahead, while the second half of the year remains difficult to predict, we are focused on our underlying business drivers. Lower asset values will impact revenue in both Wealth and Investment Management. However, in Wealth Management, rising rates are already driving NII higher, supporting performance. And net new assets remain healthy in Investment Management.\nThe diversification across fund strategies should continue to support results. What we do not know is how much volatility we will see in the coming months and how it will impact our Institutional Securities business. However, our competitive positions remain strong, and we remain close to our clients while they assess current valuations and the overall environment.\nWith that, we will now open the line up for questions.",

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sara Bersan. Please go ahead.\n\nSara Bersan\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the full year 2021 results of MediaForEurope. Today's presentation will be opted by our Group CFO, Marco Giordani, and by Matteo Cardani, Managing Director of Publitalia. During the presentation, we will show you a video. The video will represent an important section of today's presentation. So please bear with us as it gives you insight on our new commercial offer and its attractiveness to the advertisers. Now let me hand over immediately to Matteo for the advertising and audience outlook. Matteo, please go ahead.\n\nMatteo Cardani\n\nMD of Publitalia, Mediaset S.p.A.\n\nThank you, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for your attendance. Today, we will give more colors on fiscal year 2021 results, and also on the current trading. MFE fiscal year '21 result was positive. As you can see from Chart #3, at plus 14.4% year-on-year, and we were around 1.6 points better than the market that was at plus 12.8% year-on-year. So in the last fiscal year, we increased our market share from 40.3% to 40.9%. And in 2022, we are further gaining market share. In fact, the overall market has not recovered the 2019 pre-COVID level being still down 4.5% against fiscal year 2019. On the contrary, neither for Europe has not only recovered the pre-COVID level but reached a level that was up plus 2.4% versus fiscal year 2019, gaining additional EUR 45.7 million.\nThe fiscal year results above market trend is a truly impressive performance. If we consider that last year, during summer, we were competing against the European football championship and the Olympics, and we had to deal with the internal discontinuity of Champions League in August '20. Remarkably, it is the first time since 2010 that Mediaset has beaten both at the total advertising market and the TV market in a year with sport events broadcasted by competitors. The other interesting thing is that the overall results were achieved, thanks to the double-digit positive contribution of over through media, TV, radio and digital. Last but not the least, it is remarkable that we consolidated also a positive Q4 performance plus 2.2% year-on-year even against Q4 '20 already strongly positive. Then I can also anticipate that Q1 '22 is the seventh quarter in a row with a positive performance year-on-year even against a positive Q1 '21.\nSo I'd like to share with you that the company achieved the above-mentioned results, thanks to 2 main drivers. First of all, as you can see from Chart #4, the positive growth performance throughout almost all the key economic sectors. The sector represented the 85% of the MFE advertising collection were positive year-on-year. And the remaining sectors, in particular, automotive were mostly impacted by the crisis in the procurement of raw material in Q3 and Q4. But as you can see from Chart #4, where you have the weighted contribution to growth sector by sector, you can see that the crisis in the automotive sector was more than compensated by all other sectors.\nE-commerce sector gave a fundamental contribution. It's around 30% of fiscal year '21 growth. But also we benefited from recovering sectors, such as tourism, travel and leisure and also traditional sectors like fast-moving consumer goods and retail that significantly contributed to fiscal year growth performance. This was the first driver. The second driver of the advertising growth has been the strength of our offer, namely our proposition defined as the total media audience system that we are going to show you in more detail in a few minutes.\nAs you can see from Chart #5, you have the total audience evolution, linear and nonlinear. And despite all the talks around the linear TV audience downturn, actually, our linear TV audience is in good health, plus 2.1% versus 2019. On the solid ground of this linear baseline, we had the highest digital -- digit growth from digital screens. So connected TV plus mobile price tested. And this brings you to a total audience growth of plus 3.9% versus 2019. So the combination of the strength of first linear screen plus the high growth on digital screens is the perfect scenario to protect the legacy business to increase revenue diversification towards a higher digital mix.\nNow I have the pleasure to share with you a video that explains the strength and reach of our comprehensive cross-media proposition. A video that has been shown to more than 1,000 advertising during our March roadshow throughout Italy. So please go ahead with the video. Thank you.\n(presentation)\nThank you for your attention, and the go-to-market proposition of the video just shown clearly explains why in the last couple of years, we were able to overcome the market performance and also to drive attention and budgets from pure digital e-comm players.\nNow I would like to close my speech, giving a quick outlook on Q1 2022. Of course, the advertising market in Italy is having a slowdown as in all the other European countries. However, the total market is not drastically falling like it happened in Q1 2020, so we estimate a flattish trend year-on-year in Q1 2022. This is for the market. On the back of this uncertain scenario, us, MediaForEurope is further gaining market share, registering the seventh positive quarter in a row even against a positive Q1 2021. This positive trend has been sustained by 3 factors. First of all, a rational defeature of our advertising as we materially touch during our road show in March, where we had the opportunity to meet more than 1,000 advertisers, even in the case of war outbreak, advertisers did not have panic reactions, but simply adopted their plans. All the thanks to the range of investment opportunity granted by the unique MFE commercial offer. In fact, the majority of our clients have confirmed their original plans, and we have not registered any material cancellations so far.\nThe second factor sustaining our Q1 performance is the sector dynamics shown before, where we have been able to balance the slowdown of suffering sector as automotive, thanks to both the stronger traditional ones and the new sector as the e-commerce and direct to consumers. Last but not the least, the positive momentum of our total audience going on. We had the best Q1 audience performance over the past 5 years, and this performance was also supported now by official and certified metrics just released by Auditel. So to wrap up, despite the uncertain market conditions, thanks to all the factors I just commented, we were able to close Q1 2022 with a performance of plus 2% year-on-year. Having said that, I pass to Marco, and I thank you.\n\nMarco Giordani\n\nCFO, Central Manager of Administration, Finance, Control & Business Development & Executive Director, Mediaset S.p.A.\n\nThank you, Matteo, and good morning to everybody also from my side before entering the numbers, I'd like to spend a couple of words regarding the tender offer on Mediaset España minorities. As you know, we are waiting for the approval of the offer documents from CNMV. And so it's very hard to comment on this particular phase of the process, but we can tell you that as soon as the offer document will be approved and the calendar will be finalized, we will be on the market, and we are planning to meet all of you organizing a roadshow and explaining all the details about the offer.\nNow I mean, on the 2021 number, I mean, they were already disclosed beginning of March. So we will not spend a lot of time on it, but I will try to give you also the guidance regarding 2022. In any case, I'd like to underline some of the highlights of 2021. First comment would be on revenue. We came back to 2019 level with a higher profitability. And that's clearly a very good result as far as our number is concerned. We have generated EUR 475 million of EBIT. That is clearly much more higher than 2021 more than 50% up. And in terms of net profit, we closed 2021 with EUR 374 million profit, 2.5x better than 2020.\nYou know that 2021 has been affected by extraordinary gains. But even excluding them, the group net profit is more than the double than 2020 number, and it is 50% higher than 2019 level the last year before COVID emergence. The group net financial position was EUR 870 million debt at the end of 2021. We recorded an extraordinary cash generation that helped us, let's say, to improve, to reduce the debt, even including the distribution of more than EUR 340 million cashed out in July last year. Setting in, in the Italian business. Matteo has just explained the advertising performance. In any case, total revenue were EUR 2.038 billion fully recovering and exceeding 2019 level. The other revenue line in 2021 was at EUR 338 million better than an expectation. And the main contribution to this extraordinary result was given by our OTT Champions League streaming offer. The sale of in-house content to third party. We had some exceptional revenue coming from the Vivendi settlement and also the DZAN Publitalia contract that we signed in summer last year.\nMoving to guidance. 2022, there will be clearly many changes in the mix of the other revenue line. Clearly, we are not going to have the extraordinary revenue coming from the Vivendi settlement almost [EUR 428 million]. And we are going to have less revenue coming from some of the contracts we signed in 2017 with SKY for the transmission and the streaming of the premium channels that has been terminated at the beginning of 2022. On the other hand, we are going to have other improvements. The first one is coming from Medusa. Clearly, cinema now are reopened. And so the Medusa activity will restart. And in that respect, we will have some more revenue for sure for 2021. Clearly, OTT platform, Infinity performance will go on because clearly, the Champions League will not be like-for-like at 2022 versus 2021, when we started streaming only in September. And for that reason, all in all, we are expecting a level of other revenue between EUR 300 million and EUR 310 million. in full year 2022.\nAs far as costs are concerned, last year, costs were EUR 1.788 billion, in line with the guidance, showing a reduction of more than EUR 100 million compared to '19. That's the reason for which our EBIT performance was so good. As I said, revenue were higher than 2019, but costs were down EUR 100 million. So that's clearly an example of how our, let's say, cost discipline performed in 2021. And we are accounting a reduction of cost in the region of 5.4% compared to the '19 cost base.\nThen moving to 2022. Clearly, we are living in a very complex time in terms of forecasting, uncertainty is dominating not only the advertising market, as Matteo was saying, but also the cost part because clearly, we are getting some inflationary pressure, but we are going to set our 2031 focusing ourselves on flexibility and trying to adapt as much as possible our cost base in relation to the evolution of the advertising market. Clearly, we are working on a base scenario that is clearly something we are expecting now. And our base scenario is projecting an advertising revenue growth of 1% and a cost pay evolution of plus 0.6%. So in any case, improving our profitability. That's our cost base scenario, and that will produce a EUR 1.8 million cost base. This is clearly, again, a combination of several factors. We are going to have the energy cost inflation and the cost of labor inflation that are clearly affecting us in these days. And that would probably create additional cost for EUR 70 million in 2022.\nThis includes also the sports rights we acquired last summer, like Coppa Italia, Super Cup and also DZAN contract I was mentioning before. But this EUR 70 million increase in costs will be offset -- almost offset by EUR 60 million of savings representing roughly 3.4% year-on-year reduction. That's clearly our, as I said, base scenario, but we are ready to adapt our cost base following what is going to happen in the coming months that, as I said before, it's very difficult to foresee today. Lastly, I would like to underline the fact that the EBIT margin in Italy in 2021 has been the highest since 2011. So the best performance in the last 10 years.\nMoving down to the P&L. The financial income in 2021 was positive for almost EUR 20 million, and the associates were clearly affected by the extraordinary disposal of EI Towers and was almost EUR 111 million positive in 2021. Moving to 2022 guidance, financial income will be around EUR 10 million positive, again, a composition -- so let's say, a mix of effect coming from proceeding dividends and financial charges. And on the associate line, the guidance is for a positive contribution of almost EUR 15 million.\nMoving to CapEx. Page 11. As you can see, we were able to reduce a lot that amount. That's clearly the result of the change in mix of scheduling. Clearly, we are reducing the acquisition of TV rights, and we are investing more in local content that are in the OpEx side. So we have reduced last year almost EUR 75 million of TV rights investment compared to 2020. And as far as the guidance is concerned, we are confirming for 2022, the investment, let's say, level of 2021. So again, we can say that our investments are at almost 35% lower than 2019.\nThen moving to cash flow. Last page, Page 12. We have registered -- clearly, we have explained the composition of the P&L and the investments. So we have registered in 2021, a huge increase in the free cash flow. That's clearly the combination of all the elements I've just commented. And clearly, moving down in the cash flow statement, you can appreciate also the cash out for the dividends we paid in July last year. And also the contribution coming from the EI Towers extraordinary sales happen in the second quarter last year.\nMoving to 2022, the -- let's say, the net debt target for the full year will be affected by many things. The first one is the one that I mentioned before, so the uncertainty on the top line. As I said, our base case scenario is based on a plus 1% advertising revenue increase in 2022. That's clearly what the consensus is saying. As tradition, we are not estimating anything. Clearly, we will perform what the market will do. But I confirm that our base case scenario is the one that the consensus is showing. So clearly, net debt will be affected by that.\nThe second element that will affect the net debt at the end of the year will be the tender offer on Mediaset España minorities that could represent a cash up, up to EUR 258 million. And the third element that will affect the net debt in 2022 will be the dividend. I mean you have learned this morning that the Board has approved to propose to the AGM a payment of EUR 0.05 dividends for both Category A and Category B shares. That's a remarkable yield for the 2 shares, and in particular, for Class A with a 9.3% yield and also for Class B that is almost 5.5% yield. So a pretty remarkable yield for our shareholders.\nWe decided to do our best to ensure also to the Mediaset España shareholders the dividend, so we have agreed with Borsa Italiana to delay the traditional payment date to wait, so to say, that the tender offer will be completed and the offer period will be set. That's the reason for which, for the time being, we don't have a specific date for the dividend payment. And we will wait for the approval of the prospectus in Spain when the offer calendar will be set. And at that point, the dividend payment date will be set by the Board of Directors. In any case, all in all, our target for the full year is to stay in the 1.0x EBITDA -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, even including all these elements that I have just commented.\nNow I have completed my presentation, and I'll leave to the Q&A session time. Thank you. Thank you for the attention.",

On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. Within the strategic update, certain reported information has been adjusted as noted. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation of the earnings release.\nMorgan Stanley closed its acquisition of E*TRADE on October 2, 2020, impacting annual comparisons for the firm and Wealth Management and closed its acquisition of Eaton Vance on March 1, 2021, impacting period-over-period comparisons for the firm and Investment Management. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\n\nJames Patrick Gorman\n\nChairman & CEO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Morgan Stanley delivered another record year of profits and results in 2021, generating a full year ROTCE of 20%. Performance was strong in each business. In Institutional Securities, we showed strength and gained share. And in Wealth Management, we added over $430 billion of net new assets, bringing total client assets to nearly $5 trillion. We drove our strategic vision forward Investment Management, successfully closing our acquisition of Eaton Vance in the year and created a premier asset manager, which itself has $1.6 trillion of assets under management.\nSharon will discuss the details of the quarter and the full year shortly. But first, as always, I will walk through our annual strategic updates. If you turn to the document and start on Slide 3. At the beginning of last year, we set 2-year objectives with the expectation that 2021 would be a transition year as we work through our integrations. Clearly, the firm's performance exceeded the expectations we had for 2021 heading into that year. With the early successes of the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions and the firm's overall momentum, we entered 2022 ahead of plan.\nTurning to Slide 4. First, I'll focus on our 12-year transformation and where the firm is today. History offers perspective on our track record. Next, I'll highlight where we've built unique competitive advantages around each of our businesses and how we expect to grow and maintain our leading positions. Then I will address our continued commitment to return capital to our shareholders. And finally, I'll touch on how, when taken together, this should lead to further multiple expansion.\nTo begin with our longer-term evolution, Slide 5 highlights the transformation of Morgan Stanley into a more balanced, higher returning firm today. Total revenues are more than double the level of 2009 with each business significantly growing and contributing to the firm's enhanced profitability. Each of our businesses now have defensible and sustainable competitive advantages to protect and drive their leading positions.\nStart with Institutional Securities on Slide 6. Looking back to 2014, when we had recovered from the financial crisis, but before we reset our strategy and restructured some of this business, we've increased share both overall and individually across business lines. Share continues to aggregate to the industry leaders, and we expect this trend to hold. Our competitive position is strong, and as demonstrated in the very active markets for the last 2 years, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities to hold, if not gain, share across the division.\nMoving to Slide 7. Our integrated investment bank delivered $30 billion of revenues in 2021 and continues to demonstrate operating leverage, highlighted by our expanding margins. Our footprint is balanced around the world, putting us in a leading tier of investment banks with global scale. Our franchise has never been stronger, and we have seen tangible results from the collaboration between our segments.\nShifting to Wealth Management on Slide 8. The growth we have seen in 2021 has been unprecedented. We added nearly $1 trillion in client assets in a single year. Scale advantages propelled growth, and we added $438 billion of net new assets in the last 12 months. This predominantly organic growth is the result of our consistent and focused execution on our integration and expansion initiatives and puts us in a leading position.\nThe journey over the last few years has demonstrated the out of the possible. With respect to net new asset growth, this business has gone from very low single digits in the last decade to 4% to 6% more recently to unprecedented growth this year. Obviously, it's still early days but the verticals are in place. Before we commit to specific guidance for net new asset growth, we need more time to better understand the power of these channels. But what I can tell you is that the proof points are strong, and we feel great about where we are today in the business potential.\nTurning to Slide 9. With the top adviser-led business in the industry, complemented by leading workplace and self-directed offerings, the wealth franchise we've built as a category 1. We already serve nearly $5 trillion of client assets, and overall revenue on assets remains high over 50 basis points, underlining this segment is -- underlining this segment as an economic engine for the firm. As we think about the growth ahead, we are most excited about the nearly 15 million relationships we have across channels and the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate clean assets under the platform.\nOn Slide 10, we look more closely at workplace, which I'm incredibly excited about for the future. As we've said before, we see this channel as a funnel for client and asset acquisition to sustain growth going forward. We now have over $500 billion of unvested assets in this channel and expect to retain an increasing proportion as they vest. In 2021, we had a 24% retention rate. That compares with 21% the previous year. Given our focused effort, our long-term goal is to reach 30% retention. This new metric illustrates the strength of the workplace business to augment net new assets to Wealth Management.\nMoving to Investment Management on Slide 11. Our platform has transformed into premier and growing asset manager. Our distinctive capabilities enable us to deliver differentiated client value as endorsed by $115 billion of net flows in the year. Total AUM is now $1.6 trillion, and our more durable asset management fees are nearly triple what they were in 2014.\nIf you look closely with our Investment Management business on Slide 12, you can see we're a leader and growing where it matters most. Customization, specifically direct indexing through the premier Parametric brand, sustainability and alternatives are each areas of increasing client demand. We've strengthened our position across these categories with robust investment our capabilities, and we've seen meaningful asset under management growth as a result.\nMoreover, the complementary nature of distribution networks with Eaton Vance's powerful U.S. retail distribution capabilities and MSIM's strength in international distribution enhances our client reach. We're encouraged by early signs of success in leveraging the greater combined network, along with our world-class equity franchise and value-added fixed income platform, and we expect these areas will continue to drive growth into the future.\nFinally, on Slide 11, as we look ahead, we expect rates to rise. We expect approximately $500 million of incremental NII in Wealth Management this year based on the year-end forward curve. Additionally, we expect another $200 million this year from the reversal of fee waivers in our Investment Management business.\nTo further measure our rate sensitivity, we look at what happens if there is an incremental 100 basis point parallel shift in rates beyond the curve. That would deliver another $1.3 billion, which largely goes to the bottom line. While we certainly don't expect this additional shift to happen this year, the firm will clearly benefit substantially as rates rise over the next several years.\nPivoting to our capital return strategy on Slide 14. Our increased earnings power, supported by revenues from more durable sources, has enabled us to double our annualized dividend to $2.80 just last year while, at the same time, executing on meaningful share repurchases. Notwithstanding the returns we're making to shareholders and the investments we make in our business, we continue to have an excess capital position. Our CET1 ratio was 16% at year-end after paying our dividend, executing on our repurchase plan and accounting for the impact of SA-CCR.\nAnd as further illustrated on Slide 15, a growing net income has provided us the flexibility to reduce our share count. While we added 300 million shares from our 2 large acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, we continue to execute on our meaningful buyback program and have brought back our share count back to just under $1.8 billion from $2 billion in 2014.\nTaking all this together, Slide 16 highlights the fundamentals we have in place to drive future multiple expansion. We have scale, significant growth opportunities in wealth and investment management, coupled with a leading institutional business, and a strong commitment to capital return. The Morgan Stanley brand has never been stronger. We've been fortunate enough to acquire additional brands in the last few years that have tremendous value in expanding our footprint. The sum of these elements supports multiple expansion for the combined company.\nSlide 17 shows our performance goals. Of note, we are increasing our ROTCE goal to reflect the earnings power we see in our business model. We are laser focused on delivering value to our clients, our shareholders and our employees, and we believe an ROTCE in excess of 20% is achievable. As we look to the longer term, with the support of our track record behind us, we're adding a new goal, a long-term goal to achieve $10 trillion in client assets across wealth and Investment Management. As always, our targets are subject, of course, to major market moves or changes in the economic, political and regulatory environment. However, with the outlook we have now, we fully expect to achieve our goals. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results. And together, we will take your questions. Thank you.\n\nSharon Yeshaya\n\nCFO, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, and good morning. The firm produced record revenues of $59.8 billion in 2021 and ended the year on a strong footing with fourth quarter revenues of $14.5 billion. All 3 businesses contributed to the extremely strong full year results, reflecting high levels of client engagement and active market. Excluding integration-related expenses, our ROTCE was 20.2% for the full year and 20.4% for the fourth quarter, and EPS was $8.22 and $2.08, respectively.\nEven while investing in our business, we continue to demonstrate operating leverage led by Institutional Securities. The full year efficiency ratio was 67.1%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 66.3% down from 68.4% in 2020. Total expenses in the year were $40.1 [billion.] The increase in total expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the integration-related costs and higher compensation on higher revenues.\nNow to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered excellent full year performance with record revenues of $29.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $6.7 billion. Our integrated approach, global footprint and balance across business lines continues to distinguish our model.\nUnderscoring the operating leverage in the business, pretax margin was 39.6% for the full year, increasing from 34.6% in the prior year. Investment Banking revenues were a record $10.3 billion for the full year. While each business delivered record results, advisory and equity underwriting led the year-over-year improvement. Corporate clients actively pursued strategic opportunities and sponsor-deployed capital. IPO issuances were exceptionally robust in the year. And from a geographical perspective, results were led by the Americas, along with sustained strength in EMEA.\nFourth quarter revenues of $20.4 billion -- excuse me, of $2.4 billion increased 6% from the prior year driven by strength in advisory. Trends from the third quarter persisted, particularly as results benefited from a broadening of transactions across sectors. Although underwriting revenues moderated overall, equity issuance was strong, and elevated levels of event-driven activity supported fixed income.\nWe continue to invest in our Investment Banking business. Our outlook entering 2022 is strong, and our pipelines continue to be healthy across products. CEO confidence remains high, and markets remain open and constructive. Additionally, advisory transactions should support strong capital market issuance. Equity full year revenues were a record $11.4 billion, increasing 15% from the prior year as client engagement remained high. The increase versus the prior year was driven by strength in prime brokerage and, from a geographical perspective, Asia.\nRevenues were $2.9 billion in the quarter. Increased revenues in prime brokerage on higher client balances were offset by declines in cash and derivatives on lower client activity versus the prior fourth quarter. This quarter also included a mark-to-market gain of $225 million on a certain strategic investment. Fixed income revenues were $7.5 billion for the full year, declining 15% from the last year's exceptional results. The full year decline was driven by tighter bid offer spreads in macro and credit corporates partially offset by securitized products.\nQuarterly revenues of $1.2 billion were 31% lower than the prior year, reflecting a challenging trading environment and rates and lower volumes and tighter bid offer spreads and credit. Further, client engagement tempered in December, reflecting seasonal patterns impacting results.\nTurning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.2 billion and a PBT margin of 25.5%. Excluding $346 million of integration-related expenses, the PBT margin was 26.9%. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.3 billion, up 10% from the prior year, and the PBT margin was 22.6%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $109 million, the PBT margin for the quarter was 24.4%.\nQuarterly margin was negatively impacted by seasonal expenses and certain compensation and benefits decisions made to further support our employees. Given the full annual impact of these decisions was taken in the fourth quarter, the impact was amplified in this quarter's margin. Going forward, this will be spread throughout the year pro rata. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2022, we expect the PBT margin to be more in line with the 2021 full year margin, excluding integration-related expenses.\nThis business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform. Client assets grew nearly $1 trillion this year and now stands at $4.9 trillion. Fee-based flows were an incredible $179 billion in the year, recording growth in fee-based assets of $1.8 trillion or 25% higher than last year. In the quarter, asset management revenues were -- asset management revenues were $3.7 billion. Net new assets of $438 million in the year represent 11% annual growth of beginning period assets. Momentum was carried through the fourth quarter, which saw net new assets of $127 billion. We saw strong asset generation from both existing clients and net new clients driven by the adviser-led channel. We remain a destination of choice for advisers and continue to add strong teams and retain productive advisers.\nNet new assets growth is further buoyed by positive momentum in our newer channels, namely workplace. Our results demonstrate the tremendous asset generation capability of our platform. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1 billion, declining 23% from the prior year, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus prior year, revenues were flat.\nThe workplace continues to gain traction. Our total number of participants we now read stands at 5.6 million, 14% higher than last year, and unvested assets now exceed $500 billion. As James mentioned, we are reporting on a new metric to show the percentage of stock plan assets that vest and remain within Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. E*TRADE previously disclosed a similar metrics. The definition going forward will measure the retention of the value of vested stocks on a rolling 12- to 24-month period. This new metric will allow us to measure the potential strength of workplace to service the funnel to grow our asset base.\nWe saw 24% retention in 2021, which compares to 21% in 2020. As James mentioned, over time, we believe that number can reach retention for our stock plan administration business. Going forward, we plan to disclose this metric annually. Bank lending balances grew by $31 billion in the year, and now stand at $129 billion. Strong client demand for securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase. Net interest income was $1.4 billion in the quarter driven by strong lending growth and the benefit of fully phased-in funding synergies. The fourth quarter NII is a reasonable base to inform 2022. This year, NII will be impacted by the forward curve on lending growth. On rates, while the timing and the magnitude of the rate hikes is uncertain, we should benefit from rising rates and the realization of the forward curve. This would imply an estimated $500 million of additional NII this year, largely weighted to the back half of the year. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand. And while growth is likely to moderate some, we expect approximately $20 billion of loan growth in the year.\nFinally, the integration of the E*TRADE continues to go well. We are encouraged by continued client engagement and are seeing rate clients take advantage of Morgan Stanley capabilities being introduced on the E*TRADE platform. Building on our digital client experience, clients are now able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on. We have successfully merged E*TRADE's bank legal entities with Morgan Stanley. Throughout the integration efforts, we continue to focus on a unified client experience while providing clients choice. Completing this integration successfully remains a key investment priority.\nMoving to Investment Management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult. So I will make my comments primarily on an absolute basis. Investment Management reported annual revenues of $6.2 billion and quarterly revenues of $1.8 billion. Our results continue to demonstrate the diversification of this business and a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenue.\nTotal AUM rose to a record high of $1.6 trillion, of which long-term AUM was also a record at $1.1 trillion. Total net flows were $12 billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term net flows were slightly negative. For the full year, net flows were $115 billion. Asset management and related fees were $1.6 billion in the quarter. The 8% sequential increase was driven by higher performance fees. As a reminder, performance fees are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter. Performance-based income and other revenues were $166 million, reflecting broad-based gains in our diversified alternative platform.\nFinally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on track. In the first half of this year, we will bring a number of Eaton Vance and Calvert funds onto our international distribution platform. We are also now offering MSIM model portfolios on the E*TRADE platform, and we are seeing positive traction.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets were essentially flat to the prior quarter at $472 billion. We adopted SA-CCR on December 1, resulting in a $23 billion RWA increase. This was offset by a decline in activity and lower market levels towards the end of the quarter. Our SA-CCR mitigation efforts were better than we anticipated and resulted in an impact lower than our initial guidance to produce a better outcome. We repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of common stock during the quarter. We remain well capitalized post the adoption of SA-CCR, and our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%, flat to the prior quarter. Our tax rate was 23.1% for the full year. And absent any changes to tax law, we expect our 2022 tax rate to be in line with 2021. We which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility.\nIn terms of our outlook for calendar year 2022, the exit rate of our Wealth and Investment Management asset base and the integrations of our acquisitions set these businesses up to continue to perform strongly. In addition, as James discussed, the realization of the forward curve will only further support results. As it relates to institutional securities, while it remains difficult to forecast this business, the banking pipeline looks healthy and the year has started off well. That said, a lot will depend on monetary and fiscal policy and its impact on sentiment. With that, we will now open the line up for questions.",

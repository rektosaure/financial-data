Please go ahead.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations, which are based upon information currently available to the company.\nA number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Unless otherwise noted, we will be discussing our financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis on this call, and historical operational metrics will exclude pandemic years of 2020 to 2022. Please refer to the related definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures at the end of our earnings release.\nJoining us on the call today to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Scott Kirby; President, Brett Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Leskinen. We also have other members of the executive team on the line available for the Q&A. And now I'll put the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. For the last few years, we've talked about an industry that is transforming and the United Airlines is competitively positioned to win. For United, that's meant winning brand loyal customers. The third quarter is another data point that is consistent with the structural, permanent and irreversible changes is occurring in this industry.\nWe delivered strong third quarter results despite macro volatility in the first 9 months of the year, and we now expect to grow earnings for the full year. The first 3 quarters of the year were an economic downturn for airlines at least and our ability to grow earnings in the face of the macro issues is proof that the brand [indiscernible] United next strategy is resilient in tough times and a clear proof point on our path to solid double-digit margins.\nWhat we've really proven is air travel is not a commodity. Our calls in the last few years, we spent a lot of time appropriately talking about the industry structure and making predictions about how that would play out in the future. We're now seeing those predictions come true and even though it's only the second or third inning, I think the general contours of how that is going to end or widely known and easy to forecast everyone at this point. And given that, I think it's time to shift the focus and talk about how United gets to double-digit margins even in the current industry environment.\nThere are 2 points on the revenue side and likewise, 2 points on the cost side. On the revenue side, it starts with winning brand loyal customers. United is investing over $1 billion in customer product enhancements annually. And that investment is in all cabins and class of service. Every customer who flies United gets more value. For basic economy customers, we don't just offer them a competitively priced ticket. We offer them the best app and on-time flight power in every seat, seatback screens, a great loyalty program, just to name a few.\nFor brand loyal customers, we -- all the benefits I just mentioned, plus expansive clubs, more seats upfront, better food, more extensive route network to exotic destinations around the globe, and a loyalty program that gives bigger rewards and a tremendous amount of utility for their miles.\nAnd most importantly, our people are our best asset, and they're delivering for all of our customers each and every day. We're in the people business and our people have done an amazing job of caring and providing friendly service that makes customers feel good and is the foundation of keeping them brand loyal. From basic economy all the way to the Polaris class, every United customer simply gets more value at United than what our competitors offer. And that's why they're brand loyal.\nIt's also why we're winning more brand loyal customers every day, and it's the important competitive advantage that's giving us a generational lead versus most of the industry. We believe that winning brand loyal customer sets up our second revenue advantage, the potential to double the EBITDA from our loyalty program in the years to come. We're still in the pre-game warm-ups for taking the United loyalty program to another level. But in order to invest over $1 billion per year in incremental customer products and services, we had to find a different and better way to manage costs.\nHistorically, airlines looking to reduce costs and focused on cutting customer-friendly amenities like food, because most of our expense is in areas we can't control, like union contracts, airport fees, fuel, et cetera, or by adding utilization flying late at night on off-peak days [indiscernible] slower times of the year. United is doing the exact opposite of that industry [ dogma ], namely investing more for the customer and focusing on flying at times that can be profitable instead of just trying to maximize aircraft utilization. And you can see it in our numbers.\nOur major cost focus at United is to drive real cost efficiencies through our use of technology that can also improve the customer experience. In public discussions, we tended to focus more on the app and customer-facing technology, but we're doing far more behind the scenes and we're the most cutting-edge technology airline in the world. Mike will give you some examples of these technology-driven savings that allow us to lower true CASM-ex. These technology investments are efficient for costs, but they also help us to run a more reliable operation for customers.\nAnd secondly, on costs, we have large gauge increases coming as both Boeing and Airbus get back to a better delivery cadence. This strategy is working and I expect us to add at least 1 point or more of margin each year normalized for any unusual macroeconomic activity up or down, which gets us to the low teen margins in this industry capacity environment. But as I said earlier, the industry restructuring, i.e., each airline focusing its capacity in markets where they can be profitable is only in the second or third inning. And as that process plays out, I expect that to add several more margin points to United, moving us up into the mid-teens margins. And as we deliver on that, I'd bet that our multiples move up meaningfully as well.\nI'll now turn it back to the team for a run through the quarter and our outlook.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott, and good morning. This summer was the busiest in United's history. We surpassed 1 billion available seat miles in a single day and flew over 48 million customers in the quarter. Even with these volumes as well as significant summer weather disruptions and system-wide ATC challenges, our operation was resilient this quarter. The third quarter marked our lowest rate of cancellations for any third quarter in company history, and 6 of our 7 hubs ranked first or second for on-time departures.\nWe continue to adapt under pressure and to maintain flexibility during irregular operations, preserving travel plans for more than 290,000 customers by managing delays rather than canceling flights for the use of [ connection sale ]. This is what drives the most value to our customers and helps build the brand loyalty we speak so much about. And our customer NPS score was up nearly 7% this summer versus summer 2024. This performance is a testament to the dedication of our United team. So thank you to each of you.\nAt United, we remain focused on innovation and providing our teams with the most advanced tools in the industry to help them deliver their best every day. We are modernizing applications for employees that allows us to recover faster, scale support for customers, enabling better experiences even when things don't go as planned. We also continue to invest in our industry-leading digital customer experience with a new dedicated section and our mobile app focused on making tight connections smoother and more predictable for customers through real-time personalized tools and communication, driving further improvements in our customer experience and NPS scores. As we continue to take aircraft deliveries, we will also be growing our team. In 2026, we expect to hire over 2,000 pilots and over 3,200 new flight attendants.\nWe are all proud of the fact that we continue to be a destination for great talent with over 27,000 applicants in just a few days for the most recent flight attendant posting.\nRegarding the negotiations with the AFA, we met with the mediator in mid-September, and our negotiation is scheduled for the end of October. We remain focused on getting our flight attendants, the best in the industry, the industry-leading contract they deserve.\nI want to thank Secretary, Duffy; Administrator, Bedford and the administration for their support and leadership on the improvement at Newark. We are pleased with the FAA's announcement that flights in Newark will be capped through October 2026 at 72 operations per hour, which better matches the capacity of the airport. The reduction in emissions, along with the continued focus on technology upgrades and ATC staffing further underpins our confidence in Newark's long-term outlook. Newark achieved its best ever on-time departure and Star D0 for any third quarter, clear proof that the investments being made are working.\nYesterday, our first Starlink Equipped Boeing 737-800 took off from Newark following FAA certification last month. This marks a major milestone in our journey to deliver the fastest, most reliable and free for Mileage Plus members, WiFi in the skies. More than half of our regional flight now has StarLink successfully installed. We believe this superior in-flight experience will be truly game-changing as it expands across the remainder of our fleet by 2027.\nThank you to the entire United team for your continued hard work and commitment to excellence this quarter. I will now hand it over to Andrew to provide an update on the revenue environment.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. United's top line revenues increased 2.6% to $15.2 billion in the quarter on a 7.2% increase in capacity. Consolidated TRASM for the quarter was down 4.3%. Domestic PRASM was down 3.3% in Q3 on 6.6% more capacity, premium cabins outperformed the main cabin once again. After a long stream of positive RASM in quarters, United's international flights in Q3 had PRASM down 7.1%. Global long-haul demand continues to spread both earlier and later in the year out of Q3 making those periods stronger, but trade we take any day.\nPremium revenues were up 6% year-over-year and PRASM for premium cabins outperformed the main cabin by 5 points. United had the company's all-time highest business revenue [indiscernible] during the week ended October 5 of the top 5 best weeks in our history, 3 of the remaining 4 occurred in September 2025. Leisure demand is also healthy as we head into Q4. Not unlike 2024, capacity and demand are simply better balanced in the last quarter of this year, particularly for global long-haul flying. We saw bookings inflect positive in early July, and industry revenues are expected to be positive year-over-year for all remaining months of 2025. We expect our consolidated RASM to meaningfully improve in Q4 year-over-year. International RASMs in Q4 will outperform domestic based on the current outlook. We also expect that Q4 will have United's best revenue quarter ever, but also have the highest absolute RASM of any quarter of 2025.\nAs you can see by the stressed financials at many airlines, it is clear much of their domestic flying once again lost money in 2025, but also in the peak summer quarter. It is already beginning, but we believe more unprofitable industry flying will continue to be scaled back, although the timing remains uncertain. While the supply/demand imbalance did impact United's profits in the third quarter, we can report all 7 of our hubs who are profitable in the quarter.\nWe, at United, remained focused on refinements we can make to the network and commercial strategies to build a stronger margin, particularly in the third quarter of each year. Two years ago, we focused on adjustments to our Q1 network deployment that led to nearly a 4-point improvement in pretax margins. And in 2026, we're going to take a similar approach to Q3.\nFor most of recent prepandemic history, Q3 RASMs were consistent with Q2 and Q4, with the modest peaking of the capacity in Q3, where marginal RASM was greater than marginal CASM. However, in 2024, we saw GAAP emerge where Q3 RASM at United trailed Q2 and Q4. We expect -- in 2025, we expect this gap to once again exist and to have widened. This Q3 issue appears to be an industry issue not specific to United. As much as we love the relative Q4 performance in recent years, the idea that Q3 trails by the magnitude we've seen in 2024 and in 2025 represents an opportunity for margin expansion.\nIn 2026, we'll adjust how peaked our summer capacity plan is by ending the summer schedule a week early, operating 15% fewer Red Eye flights and tended more capacity from the July 4 holiday to name a few, in pursuit of higher margins. I also expect that our Atlantic capacity year-over-year, excluding Tel Aviv will be flat to negative in Q3 2026.\nUnited's business model now has a more balanced demand levels across more of the year as our increasingly optimal mix between leisure demand, premium leisure demand and business demand is yet another emerging advantage we have over commodity-based airlines. United's ability to further de-seasonalize capacity, we think, creates yet another opportunity for cost convergence versus commodity airlines, they only see profit opportunities on peak leisure travel demand days or months. I think it's interesting to note, profitability is now inversely correlated with aircraft utilization in the U.S. The highest utilization airlines have the lowest margins.\nMileage Plus had another strong quarter with total loyalty revenues up over 9%, overhead remuneration was up 15% year-over-year and should end the year up over 12%. We are seeing increased retention of cardholders along with higher spend as United's brand grows.\nToday, I'd also like to share my view of where United has come from in the past decade, why our actual 2025 results thus far have proven so durable and what we expect to drive continued gains among brand loyal customers and double-digit margins down the line. Starting with our many transformational annual investments of over $1 billion for our customers, we have successfully decommoditized most of United's passenger revenues. We believe that our tilt to brand loyal capacity and products in the last 5 years was well timed, but also consistent with the demand profile in our hub cities, which is why it's worked so well and why our premium efforts will be more margin accretive than others. However, it's important to understand we're always investing to create value for all passengers in all cabins. Even our most premium yield passengers often fly in the main cabin and our efforts to convert passengers to brand loyal clearly starts in the main cabin.\nBasic Economy has altered the competitive landscape in the U.S. and providing United a profitable entry far to attract many customers over a full life cycle.\nQuality and value matters more than ever to U.S. consumers, clubs that are not overcrowded, enhanced meals, great wind, industry leading technology, great customer service, seat-back screens and fast WiFi to name a few, those are the attributes we focus on. The quality part of the product offering was often overlooked by many as we favored simplicity and low cost. In our view, quality goes well beyond the schedule we offer are inherent excellent reliability. Smaller details do matter, and that combined with best-in-class customer service our team members deliver sets us up for success.\nConsistency of our products and services was unsurprisingly low at the early stages of our transformation, but is now reaching critical mass. United now operates 765 jets with more than 146,000 seat-back screens. These screens are 1 way of defining a premium airline in the U.S. Our signature interior conversion is now at 64% and an investment of over $1.6 million.\nAt United, we've proven our ability to increase our relative RASM with the best results, while at the same time increasing domestic gauge by almost 20% since 2019. We said a decade ago that not all capacity was created equal, and our results have proven that business case. The statement is only true for Brand Loyal Airlines. Domestic gauge is expected to once again accelerate in 2027 as our [ 200 A321 ] fleet reaches critical mass after years of delay, helping drive better customer experience, but also creating cost convergence with others. This gauge increases a proven formula for margin growth and accelerate as we retire smaller, lower-margin A319 and A320 aircraft from our fleet by 2030. United hubs can support this higher gauge and allows us to accept more basic economy fasteners at a profit.\nOur transformation is making the world a smaller place for United and allowed us to add unique find places including, but not limited to, Greenland and Mongolia. A large thanks to the 100,000-plus United team members together have built this durable generational lead. I'm going to turn it over to Mike to talk about our financial results. Mike?\n\nMichael D. Leskinen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew. We delivered a strong third quarter. Customers are speaking with their wallets and are increasingly choosing to fly United because of our strong operational performance and the significant investments we made and continue to make in the airline. StarLink is another example of how we're differentiating our customer experience for the better.\nThis quarter, I'm particularly proud of our team for our disciplined cost management. I expect that our [ negative 0.9% ] CASM-ex performance will be industry-leading.\nAs Scott mentioned, we made strategic investments in our products that drive higher costs, but we are helping to offset those by running the core airline more efficiently. And those investments are increasingly differentiating United Airlines, creating brand loyal customers, decommoditizing United and driving solid margins and returns on capital. We've been investing over $1 billion annually over the last few years into improving our aircraft, our clubs, our food and our WiFi, and we expect to spend another $1 billion next year.\nWe increased the amount we spend on food by 25% this year. We're investing $1 billion on our rollout of Starlink WiFi so that our customers have the best-in-class connectivity. Our investments in clubs doubled in 2025 and is expected to more than double in 2026 as demand for this product continues to grow.\nThese are just a few examples, but it's important to note that we're doing this all while delivering industry-leading cost performance. Being able to invest in our customer experience is possible because we're simultaneously driving efficiency in the core operation. That produces meaningful and permanent savings. Some examples include: modernizing all of our maintenance technologies so that can be used on iPads, allowing our technicians quicker access to United resources. For example, before introducing iPads throughout the shift, our technicians would walk to and from our hangers and aircraft, checking the aircraft's paper logbook, printing manuals from the legacy mainframe systems at the hangar and ordering parts from their terminal at the hangar to ultimately fix the aircraft. Today, iPads give technicians the ability to instantaneously access, troubleshooting manuals and order parts, all while at the aircraft, turning airplanes faster and improving the efficiency of our workforce.\nAdditionally, significant investments in people, process and technology have been made to improve our recovery from IROPs events which enables us to restart the airline following an event much quicker than we have in the past. One particular tool already in use is our Orca tool, which optimizes aircraft routing, crew pairings and customer connections so that our targeted delays or cancels prioritize our customers and the optimal plan for guiding the airline through significant events.\nOur operational leadership and frontline employees are performing the best in our history. This has led to United leading the industry in the quickest recovery following significant events and you can see the direct impact of that comparing our third quarter cost to others in the industry.\nWe're not just looking to make our operation more efficient. We're making process changing -- changes and using AI to make -- the work of our headquarters management team more efficient too. In fact, our management headcount is 4% lower than last year as this efficiency work continues, we're planning to shrink another 4% in 2026. This is a new culture at United Airlines, and as such, I'm going to give a long-term framework on how we're thinking about CASM-ex.\nGeneral inflation in this industry is running about 3% to 4% annually, and we expect that to continue inclusive of labor. At United, our gauge growth should provide about a 1-point annual tailwind through the end of the decade. We're also committed to driving efficiency into the core business of another 1 point per year. So together, our core CASM-ex growth should run up at 1% to 2% annually if we did nothing else. But as we've been highlighting, United is transforming because of our investments we have made into improving the customer experience and decommoditizing air travel. You should expect that to continue. And on average, we expect that to add about 1 point of CASM-ex pressure per year that is more than offset by revenue generation. Altogether, our CASM-ex run rate should run up around 2% to 3% annually.\nNow turning to the quarter. We delivered third quarter earnings per share of $2.78 above the top end of our guidance range of $2.25 to $2.75. And ahead of Wall Street expectations of $2.68. Our pretax margin was 8% and would have been a point higher absent the disruptions earlier this year at Newark. We had industry-leading operational performance that underpins strong unit cost performance. Our third quarter CASM-ex was down 0.9%.\nOur costs in the quarter did benefit by approximately 1 point of expense moving to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by maintenance and approximately 1 point from the timing of certain labor contracts.\nLooking to the fourth quarter. The momentum in the revenue environment, Andrew described continues, and we expect fourth quarter EPS to be $3 to $3.50, that brings our full year EPS towards the better half of our full year 2025 guidance range of $9 to $11 and should position us to be the only airline to grow earnings this year. This demonstrates that winning brand loyal customer drives resilience in the business and when the economy rallies provides upside.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, the industry now has 2 brand loyal, structurally profitable and revenue diverse airlines, which together will represent about 100% of industry profits in 2025. We continue to target double-digit pretax margins in the long term.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We continue to march towards our goal of an investment-grade balance sheet. During the quarter and earlier this month, we bought back [ 377 ] aircraft off of expensive COVID Air leases to carry implied interest rates in the high single digits. This accelerated our deleveraging efforts while further optimizing our cost of capital. We've eliminated all expensive financing from the balance sheet and have no fixed coupons over 6%, an average floating margin of 1.9% and an average cost of debt of less than 5%. These actions are being noticed by the rating agencies. We are upgraded by S&P to BB+ from BB on August 12, the highest they have rated us in over 2 decades. This change gives recognition to the fact that our business plan is working as our earnings grow and become more resilient and continue our migration towards investment-grade credit ratings.\nFree cash flow generation also remains a key focus, and we expect to generate over $3 billion in free cash flow this year. I've talked about free cash flow conversion around 50%, and this year, we're trending well above that due to the timing of aircraft deliveries. As aircraft deliveries accelerate and CapEx rises, we expect to remain in the 50% range. And as we exit the decade, we expect the conversion to accelerate closer to around 75%.\nOn the buyback, we continue to take a measured approach and take advantage of opportunistic moves in the market while also working towards getting our net leverage below 2x.\nTo wrap it up, I want to thank the team for their continued execution. Our ability to manage through what has been an earnings recession for the airline industry has been remarkable. And while I still think there is upside to our absolute margin, and that matters the most, our relative margin is outstanding. My confidence in the financial future continues to grow as we exit the year. United Airlines and the industry continue to transform into a customer-centric brand-loyal business. United Airlines will continue to provide more value to our customers, to our employees and to our shareholders. Now back to Kristina to start Q&A.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. We will now take questions from the analyst community. We want to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to 1 question and if absolutely needed 1 follow-up question. Regina, please describe the procedure to ask a question."

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available for Q&A. And now I'd like to kick the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kristine. Good morning, everyone. The second quarter was yet another proof point that the United Next strategy continues to work and as the 2 brand loyal [indiscernible] of airlines continue to generate the bulk of industry profits. I'm extremely proud of the team for executing a strong operation and navigating through a volatile macro period and unique short-term issues that impacted United Newark while still managing to grow earnings and margins for the first half of the year.\nNewark faced unique challenges this quarter. With the help in partnership with the FAA and DOT, it has rebounded stronger and has been the best performing airport in the New York City area. But I know that everyone, including us, cares more about the future than the past. So I'm going to start today with the two macro drivers of our industry, supply and demand.\nFrom a supply perspective, it's deja vu all over again. This is almost the exact same setup that we had a year ago at this time with weak RASM results across the industry, leading to supply cuts starting in mid-August, leading to better margin results which then led to strong stock price performance. But demand also matters in this equation and demand, while it stabilized, was about 5 points weaker in the first half of the year than we were expecting at the start of the year. As we look closely at the data, we've had a hypothesis, which seems increasingly correct. Demand was weak for the last 5 months due to high levels of uncertainty for both businesses and consumers. I'm sure that's not a shocking thesis. But in the past few weeks, the level of uncertainty has declined. The tax situation is settled after the reconciliation bill pass. The geopolitical situation in the Middle East appears to have stabilized. And while tariffs are not yet certain, I think the market in most businesses have a much better read on how they'll manage in a narrow array of outcomes.\nAnd encouragingly, that higher level of certainty has translated into a meaningful inflection in demand. It's only 3 weeks' worth of data. Andrew will give you more detail. But as uncertainty has declined, we've seen an improvement in book revenue, including a double-digit acceleration in business demand. So to summarize the macro. Supply is adjusting once again, just like it did last year. Demand feels to us like it is inflected upward and is returning toward the normal trend line we expected at the start of the year. And bigger picture, for United, the industry and United industry-specific transformation we've been discussing over the last few years continues to play out.\nOne, [ revenue ] diversity, and that includes basic economy just as well as premium is the only formula that works in the U.S. to have industry-leading margins. Two, the two brand loyal airlines continue to just gradually win share quarter-over-quarter and the advantages that we have are structural, permanent, irreversible and they're growing, and it's simply not practical to copy them. Three, convergence, specifically at the high-cost airport, is making the economic flying at those airports for low-cost carriers [indiscernible].\nFor what it's worth, the only remaining successful LCC around the globe in my view is Ryanair. And guess what? That's because they're the only LCC that stayed true to their founding principles and don't fly to high-cost airports like London, Heathrow or [indiscernible] Gulf. Four, and all of that is gradually leading airline focused on their comparative advantages. It's often two steps forward and one step back, but the trend continues to be towards each airline flying more and more in places where they have relative strength and shrinking in places where they're at a disadvantage. That, of course, is just basic economics, but it's happening. And because it's just basic economics, that trend is going to continue for years to come.\nSo to conclude, I'm proud of the team for overcoming the macro and Newark environment in the first half of the year. We had high confidence that the supply changes were coming, but it's good to actually see them. But I'm also encouraged that the demand environment appears to have inflected back towards the trend line we're expecting to start the year. Typically, I would now leave it to Brett to speak next, but he's not able to join us for the call today. He recently had a pre-planned surgery and is on the road to recovery. We're looking forward to having him back soon. So for today's call, I'll hand it off to Chief Operations Officer, Toby Enqvist.\n\nTorbjorn J. Enqvist\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Customer Officer, United Airlines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott. I'm really proud of our United team and our operational performance in the second quarter. Before I detail our top-tier system-wide results, I'm going to start with the hop back at the most attention this quarter, Newark.\nLocated in the largest media market in America and the most crowded airspace in the world. Newark will always get outside attention even this past week when all the New York City airports were hit with severe weather, it disrupted at travel plans and got a lot of airtime. Thunder storms are going to happen, especially in the summer. That's why cementing the progress we have made over the last couple of months to improve the resilience of our New York operation is a huge priority for United. At the start of the second quarter, our New York team was thrust into the middle of a perfect storm, a string of FAA technology outages, combined with Newark's ongoing runway construction and the FAA staffing shortages drove cancellations and delays, impacting customers' perception of the reliability of the airport.\nThose perception and the extensive negative news coverage of the situation at Newark Airport drove meaningful book-away and load factors dropped 15 points following the event. As a result of the book away and capacity reduction, Q2 margins were impacted by approximately 1.2 points. We expect that the impact will linger into Q3 with an approximately 1 point margin impact. But here's the key takeaway, and it's really good news. We've already seen a dramatic turnaround in Newark. Bookings have largely recovered, and we don't expect any impact in Q4 because Newark isn't just back to normal, it's running better than ever. In fact, United's operation at Newark had the fewest cancellations and most on-time flights of any airport in the New York area in the month of June. The airport now is actually operating within its capability and our team is back to running an operation that delivers a great experience for our customers. These are the changes that made it possible. Thanks to the great work of the airport authority and Newark runway construction was completed 2 weeks early and the runway re-opened on June 2.\nThe FAA was able to upgrade their fiber optic technology, and perhaps the most important way, the FAA implemented badly needed hourly flat caps to prevent the airport schedule from exceeding its capacity. Newark has had a schedule and capacity problem. We have been urging the FAA to fix for more than a decade. And thanks to the leadership shown by Secretary Duffy, we now have the line of sight to a longer-term solution to this problem. [indiscernible] slightly we look back and find that this long-term capacity fix is the most important and positive outcome [indiscernible] public. What happened [indiscernible] April and May is also evidence of the broader need to improve our nation's ATC infrastructure. United was deeply engaged with Secretary Duffy and the FAA, we successfully advocated for the $12.5 billion in funding that Congress just passed earlier this month to begin the long overdue process of rebuilding our outdated ATC infrastructure. Much of this funding will go towards upgrading copper wire to modern fiber optic cables to help reduce the hundreds of outages that FAA experience across the ATC system. We look forward to working with Secretary Duffy and leadership in Congress for the additional funding needed to fully update our ATC technology.\nI actually ran Newark Airport for United from 2011 to 2014. So I know the airport really well, and I'm more optimistic about the United's future there than I've ever been, because Newark has never been in better positioned to operate reliable and profitable than there is right now. From the FAA to Secretary Duffy, to Governor Murphy to the New Jersey Congressional Delegation to the [indiscernible] of New York, New Jersey lots of people deserve credit for this turnaround. But our team on the ground in Newark to serve the most. They are professional, resilient, focused and committed. Despite challenges that were out of their control, they showed up day after day and deliver for our customers and one another. All across the system, United offering continues to fire on all cylinders and continue to be a big reason where our airline is [indiscernible]. We ranked #2 in an on-time departure among the top 8 U.S. carriers, even though we operate in the toughest markets in the world, all while managing record high customer volumes, including the busiest travel day in United history with over 611,000 passengers on June 22.\nWe also had one of the lowest second quarter seat cancelation rates in our history. This [indiscernible] strength played a key role in supporting our strong NPS performance in the quarter, our highest Q2 NPS since the pandemics. Thank you to the entire United team for delivering a fantastic second quarter result, and I'll hand it over to Andrew to talk about the revenue environment.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Toby. United's top line revenue increased 1.7% to a record $15.2 billion in the quarter. Consolidated TRASM for the quarter was down 4% on a 5.9% increase in capacity. Adjusted for events at Newark, we believe United TRASM would have been down [ 2% to 3% ] and our EPS would have been at the high end of our guide. This outcome for Q2 comes during the highest level of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty we have seen in years.\nInternational flying outperformed domestic yet again with a RASM decrease of 1% compared to a domestic decrease of 7%. United Pacific operations continued their impressive results to a positive RASM growth in Q2 across most destinations. We look forward to new service to Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines starting later this year, subject to government approval. The Atlantic, which had an incredible run of 23% RASMs since the pandemic did have negative RASM year-over-year. Unlike in off-peak quarters, pushing Atlantic RASM higher in peak period has proved more difficult in part due to the spread leisure demand to usually lower demand period. Margins in these historically off-peak periods are up, while margins in peak months, which are still high, are down.\nPremium Cabin revenues were again strong in Q2, increasing 5.6% year-on-year, while the economy cabin was negative. Overall premium RASMs were 6 points better than nonpremium. It's nice to see once again that the premium capacity remains resilient. Given the consistency of these results, we plan to further lean into premium processing capacity in the coming years. Cargo performed strong with revenue up 4% year-over-year on record volumes and loyalty revenues had another strong quarter with revenues up 9%. Now turning to our outlook for Q3 and the rest of the year.\nNewark's negative impact on bookings in Q2 for future travel are expected to have a very temporary impact on revenue results in Q3 of about 1 point. The good news is Newark's share of New York city sales has now largely recovered in July, along with the reliability of our flight operations, Passengers can now book with [indiscernible]. Newark sales returned normal [indiscernible] are critical to our revenue performance. However, in addition to normal New York sales volume, we are seeing a step down published industry capacity later this summer that we believe will be a positive for United.\nPublic industry domestic capacity for August and September indicates slightly less capacity year-over-year, when just a few months ago, it was published at up almost 4%. Low-margin airlines without strong brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams cut-in unprofitable flying. We believe this is [indiscernible] and inevitable outcome and outcome that we expect will be uniquely beneficial to brand loyal airlines with much higher margins and well defined diversified networks and products. A great reset we see from the low-margin airline today [indiscernible] for them, but in no way do we expect them to match what we offer consumers today, plus what we have planned in the future.\nWe have a large lead and we intend to maintain that with further innovation. Combining the normalized Newark sales, along with less overall industry capacity, sets up an improved revenue backdrop. However, the most important developer revenues is at the overall demand environment. Recent United and industry sales data confirms a demand environment that has inflected positively in recent weeks due to this less macroeconomic uncertainty. Just as quickly as demand stepped down in early February due to this uncertainty, it appears that demand is now stepping up. This step-up is a 6-point positive swing in sales to-date in July versus the second quarter but even more importantly, a full digit swing in higher yield in business revenues in the same period.\nDomestic tickets sales are now also showing positive year-over-year yields, reflecting this improved demand environment for the first time since February. For us, we believe these four factors of new performance, industry capacity, demand improvements and positive domestic yields makes the setup for post-summer 2025, very similar to the period in 2024. As you will recall, the second half 2024 setup created a very good outcome for Q4 and a nice run-up in our stock price. This significant positive momentum in sales in recent weeks is nice to see, that it is really important to draw distinction between bookings and [indiscernible] revenue as we look at Q3. Recent booking strength does not change the fact that 50% of the third quarter sales were sold as of July 1, prior to the [indiscernible], along with the unique impact of temporary lower demand for Newark on United sales. The setup for global flying all looks much better as we head into Q4.\nFor United, Q3 relies the most on the segments of the business that have been the weakest in 2025. Offshore sales and main cabin sales. As we head into Q4, we historically rely more on onshore business and premium demand, which makes Q4 of a better outlook in the current environment. Our early look at Q4 global yields and bookings support our view but we still have a long way to go and Q3 RASM will likely be negative year-over-year.\nIn summary, booking strength is -- now translates into stronger flowing revenues and RASM later in Q3 and Q4. This recent sales momentum, along with [indiscernible] point of negative impact on Newark on Q3 RASM gives us confidence that the implied RASM step-up from Q3 to Q4, we had our internal outlook is quite achievable and maybe even conservative. We are hopeful that cooled Middle East tensions will allow a full schedule to Tel Aviv soon. We plan to resume Tel Aviv service initially just from Newark on July 21 and will include other gateways later this year.\nBuild domestic [indiscernible] at our hubs continues to be one of our largest focuses for 2025 and 2026 as we recreate winning schedules and ultimately larger PRASM, RASM premiums versus others in the process. We believe this connectivity effort, combined with larger [indiscernible] jets with more premium seats will narrow significantly the margin gap between our domestic and international flying. United has grown its relative TRASM by 7 points more than the industry since 2019 and faster than other carriers since the [ pandemic ] as evidence that our plan is working and not all capacity is created equally.\nBrand loyalty for United is increasing with documented share gains in Q1 in each of our hubs. United's revenues are more diverse than ever and in the process, our product choice range gives customers more choices for the experience they desire. United plans to introduce the Polaris Studio suite later this year, another step in increase in our premium capacity and revenue diversity. We also look forward to building our Blue Sky collaboration with JetBlue later this year to help create a more competitive alternative for United customers and MileagePlus members in New York City, along with Boston. We also look forward to returning to JFK in 2027 after a long absence with a competitive schedule and a built-in frequent flyer base.\nIn summary, we remain bullish about the future given less macroeconomic uncertainty we are seeing, plus scheduled capacity changes by the low margin [indiscernible] this summer. The inflection in bookings and yields we've recently seen gives us great confidence. With that, I want to say thanks to the entire United team for running a great airline in Q2, and I will hand it off to Mike to discuss our financial results.\n\nMichael D. Leskinen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew. I'm very proud of the United team this quarter. We faced several geopolitical challenges that impacted [indiscernible] prices and customer demand while also managing through the Newark difficulties that Toby discussed earlier. And despite all of this, we delivered earnings per share of $3.87, well within our guidance range and ahead of Wall Street expectations of $3.81. I'm very pleased with these results, I want to highlight that if we excluded the financial fact of the Newark disruption, we would have been above the high end of our range. This is another proof point that our United Next plan is working. In fact, I'd go as far to say that our plan has worked.\nThe industry has transformed into a healthier industry where customers are brand loyal, and increasingly choose to fly not just based on the schedule but also based on their preferences for reliability, for clubs, for technology and for loyalty programs. The industry now has two brand loyal, structurally [indiscernible] and revenue diverse airlines, which has driven much of the rest of the industry to cut money-losing capacity to return to profitability. This is air reversal and will lead to stable double-digit margins for United Airlines.\nTurning to costs. We continue to run better than planned, and I'm pleased with the 2.2% CASM-ex growth we delivered in the second quarter. You've heard me say that the best way to manage cost is to run a reliable airline, and this team continues to deliver. I expect similar cost performance for the remainder of the year. As we look to the third quarter, we expect continued stabilization in the geopolitical environment. This is already driving stronger bookings, and as Andrew discussed, we're optimistic those trends will continue.\nTaking that into account, along with the continued strong cost performance, we expect third quarter EPS to be between $2.25 and $2.75. Consistent with what happened last year, we also expect the industry to continue to reduce money-losing capacity in domestic markets beyond September. This adds to our confidence in the fourth quarter and may even lead to upside as we continue to believe in our path to double digit pretax margins longer term. For now, we expect full year EPS to be between $9 and $11.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $18.6 billion in liquidity, including our $3 billion undrawn revolver. We generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow, and importantly, on July 7, we paid down the remaining $1.5 billion balance of our MileagePlus bonds 2 years early. This was our most expensive remaining fixed rate debt. This prepayment, along with the prepayment of the MileagePlus term loan, 1 year ago, fully un-encumbers the MileagePlus business, a crown jewel asset of United. With this prepayment, we have unencumbered assets that exceed $40 billion. Strengthening the balance sheet remains a top priority, and we target net leverage below 2x and continue to work towards investment grade. With this prepayment, we've now reduced our gross debt by almost $7 billion since the peak debt level of COVID. Our average cost of debt is now 4.7%.\nOn the buyback, we repurchased $235 million worth of shares at an average price of $66 during the quarter, leaving $829 million in authorization. We will continue to take a balanced approach to our capital allocation strategy. Our shares continue to trade below our view of intrinsic value. Therefore, we are balancing the level of buyback while also pursuing our leverage target. We ended the second quarter at 2x net leverage. Free cash flow generation also remains a priority, and we now expect to generate over $2 billion in free cash flow for the year.\nIn conclusion, I remain excited about the future of United Airlines, and we will continue to work to deliver on our financial commitments. Despite the headwinds we faced in the first half of the year, we delivered significant growth in EPS and we feel very good about the core fundamentals of our airline in the second half of 2025 and beyond. Now back to Kristina to start the Q&A.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. [indiscernible] that excitement. We'll now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed, one follow-up question. Krista, please describe the procedure to ask a question."

We also recognize that there's a real risk of the U S economy going into a recession.\n\nIf we enter a recession, we are modeling an additional five point reduction in total revenue for the remainder of the year on average per quarter in that scenario, we would make an additional downward adjustment to capacity and we have not assumed any further relief in fuel price, even though that might happen.\n\nEven in that World, we expect our full year earnings per share to be between $7 and $9.\n\nWell that is not what our expectations were at the start of the year that scenario would be the first time, United would have remained solidly profitable through recession.\n\nWe believe it would justify significant multiple expansion as we will have proven our financial resiliency are greatly improved competitive position and the durability of a de commoditize business powered by brand loyal customers.\n\nTurning to the balance sheet.\n\nWe ended the first quarter with $18 3 billion in liquidity, including our Undrawn revolver, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow and paid down $1 billion of debt.\n\nIn fact over the last 12 months, we've generated over $5 billion in free cash flow, representing approximately 130% of our net income at.\n\nAt our current equity valuation that represents an over 20% free cash flow yield.\n\nOur net leverage was reduced to 2.0 times from two two times at the end of the at the end of 2024, marking continued progress as we work towards our long term net leverage target of less than two times.\n\nRecognizing our progress Fitch upgraded the United a double b with a positive outlook with the change to a positive outlook from Moody's as well.\n\nOn the buyback as of April 10th we've repurchased approximately five 6 million shares in 2025 at an average price of $80.\n\nHistory has taught us that even industry leaders are prone to steep market over corrections in times like this and we built our buyback strategy around being opportunistic.\n\nWe believe this is precisely the right time to repurchase our shares at our current depressed valuation with approximately $1 billion left in authorization.\n\nRegardless of the economic path ahead, we expect our financial results to be resilient and we believe that the long term earnings power of our company Hasnt changed and frankly, it's possible that some of the weaker airlines may be forced to curtail money, losing capacity sooner than they otherwise might have.\n\nTherefore, our view of the intrinsic value of our shares also hasnt changed in fact as I mentioned earlier, we believe our multiple should expand as we proved that our business is stronger and more resilient even in a time of economic stress.\n\nFor as long as our share price remains depressed we plan to continue to utilize a meaningful portion of free cash flow to repurchase shares at what we believe are discounted prices.\n\nAs I've mentioned in the last several quarters free cash flow generation remains a top priority.\n\nWhile demand has softened we continue to expect.\n\nContinue to expect to generate full year free cash flow approaching $3 billion in a base case and positive free cash flow even in a downside recession scenario scenario.\n\nTo close unites competitive competitive position in the industry is only strengthening.\n\nWe're focused on leaning into our network strengths continuing to win brand loyal customers and delivering on our financial commitments now back to Christina to start the Q&A.\n\nThank you, Mike we will not be questions from analysts.

Please go ahead.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to United's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website at ir.united.com.\nInformation in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations, which are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.\nUnless otherwise noted, we will be discussing our financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis on this call. Please refer to the related definitions and reconciliations in our press release. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release.\nJoining us today on the call to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Scott Kirby; President, Brett Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Leskinen. In addition, we have other members of the executive team online available for Q&A.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kristina, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I want to begin by saying that our thoughts are with those affected by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area. We've been in close touch with our employees and communities in the area to offer them support. We'll continue to monitor the situation to see if there are more ways that we can help.\nTurning to earnings. 2024 was another solid proof point on our way to double-digit margins. By the fall of 2020, several months after COVID struck, we at United had a clear vision of how our airline and the industry were going to evolve. And 2024 seems to have been the year that we gained broad recognition from others that the vision is playing out as we expected.\nOur outlook has always been based on a realistic view of how the economics of the industry were going to change and how those changes have the potential to drive structural, permanent and irreversible changes in the entire industry. Our 2024 plan developed from that vision, and our results were the culmination of years of thoughtful planning, bold actions and strategic investments.\nI'd like to thank our employees for these stellar results. And I'm proud to say that we'll be paying out $713 million in profit sharing this year.\nIn 2024, United continued to make progress with our United Next plan and once again delivered earnings within our original range. Our investments over the last several years have further differentiated United from the rest of the industry and led a strong customer preference for the United brand.\nBut the bigger point here is that the changes that led to this moment are structural and durable. Cost convergence, which we first talked publicly about on this call in Houston 2 years ago, combined with effective revenue diversity at United for the first time ever and industry-leading product and service, causing customers to choose United are just irreversible structural changes that have created a competitive moat for United.\nAnswering an analyst question 2 quarters ago, I talked about how this feels very much like 2012 to 2014. But today, I'll add that there are 2 additional tailwinds this time around. The international environment, which Andrew will discuss in more detail, is going to be far stronger for longer because of the structural supply constraints that are going to last at least for the rest of this decade. Wide-body supply, both airframes and engines, is even more challenged than narrow-bodies.\nAnd second, domestically, the seeds of the 2012 to 2014 [indiscernible] demise were being shown at the time with 15% to 20% growth from the ULCCs. It's very hard to see that happening again. Importantly, all of this means that the industry is evolving into an equilibrium where each airline driven by economic necessity will be primarily focused on flying where they have a competitive advantage. Different airlines have different competitive strengths and weaknesses in the post-COVID era.\nCost convergence has been the most impactful at the big high-cost airports in the country. The cost per passenger in the 3 New York City airports is $48 compared to the average ULCC fare of $67 in those 3 airports. When an airline is spending 72% of their fare on airport costs, it's hard for me to imagine that they could ever be profitable in those airports.\nAt the same time, LCCs do have an advantage and will always be able to be more profitable than United in point-to-point low-cost airports. It really is a transformed industry, and United more than anyone is leading the way.\nWe have 7 great hubs. We got well ahead of the curve in investing for the future, and we're focusing all of our efforts in growth in our hubs where we have the competitive advantage.\nThe combined virtues of our side and our innovative culture make us a competitive juggernaut. We know who we are. We know our strengths. We also know our weaknesses, and we're going to focus on our strength and nothing else.\nBut we won't rest on our laurels. We will never be complacent or satisfied with our results. We'll continue to be an airline where good leads the way by focusing on ways to be even better airline for our customers.\nStarlink is one of the most obvious high-profile investments for customers that's really just the visible tip of the iceberg. Our digital team is expanding our best-in-the-world technology by making further improvements to make the airline even more transparent and easy to do business with.\nAnd our ops team is focused on changing the unchangeable and trying to solve problems that no other airline in the world has ever even tried to fix. And we'll continue to invest in a brand that inspires pride in employees and customers alike.\nThis year, we expect to grow our EPS by approximately 18% at the midpoint. And we'll deliver strong free cash flow while continuing to invest in the future. That includes signing industry-leading contracts with our United team, which is made up of the best aviation professionals in the world. We are the best airline in the history of aviation, and we're going to continue to raise that bar. That's been and will continue to be increasingly good for our employees, customers and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott, and good morning. 2024 was an exceptional year for United. The investments we've made to improve our operational reliability and resilience have driven top-tier results. We served a record nearly 174 million customers last year and finished the year first and on-time departures at all 7 of our hubs.\nWe had the busiest December in our history, flying on average 511,000 people a day. And when so many of our customers were counting on us to get them home safely for the holidays, we closed out the month of December ranked #1 in on-time departures.\nI want to thank the incredible professionals at United, who worked through the holidays and through tough weather to deliver for our customers. Thanks too [indiscernible] enhance processes for recovering crews during our regular operation events. We achieved an 82% reduction in crew-related cancellations compared to [ 2 ] prior years.\nAdditionally, we continued refining our aircraft turn process, focusing on key components such as aircraft cleaner time and boarding efficiency, driving improved turnaround speed and overall operational performance. In 2024, we had the company's best post-pandemic turn execution, reducing cancellations and improving efficiency, both meaningfully cut costs and results in a much better experience for our customers.\nDespite that progress, staffing at the FAA remains a challenge for the airline industry and most importantly, the traveling public. In 2024, even on clear blue sky days, 66% of United delays were driven by ATC challenges and technology and staffing. We remain engaged with leaders in Washington and in both parties to get the FAA the resources they need. And we'll look for opportunities to work with the new Congress and new administration to achieve that goal.\nOver the last several years, our culture of innovation has fueled countless enhancements and technology that empower our employees and improve customers' experiences. And just for the last several months, our team has developed new capabilities for our award-winning app like integrating Apple Air tag data to help us reunite customers with their bags and allowing customers to select seat premises so they can get moved to the seat they prefer automatically as soon as it becomes available.\nTranslating our entire app into Spanish drove usage even higher. And now nearly 90% of customers engage with our digital channels on the day they travel. In 2024, these and other app enhancements enable half of our customers who experienced a cancellation to utilize a self-service or automated method to get back on their way, a 28% increase year-over-year.\nOur industry-leading app has led to happier customers, who have more control over their travels and employees, who have more time to help customers who most need it. At United, we're proud of this culture of innovation because it's central to our effort to differentiate our good leads the way brand and give our customers even more reasons to choose United.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Andrew to review our strong revenue performance in 2024 and discuss our expectations for revenue environment in 2025.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. The fourth quarter revenue environment materially improved as the capacity backdrop for the industry became more constructive. United's Q4 TRASM increased 1.6% year-over-year on a 6.2% increase in capacity. The Sunday after Thanksgiving was our best revenue day in history, shattering the former record by 25%.\nUnited's domestic capacity increased 7.8% in Q4 with RASM down 1.9%. We project domestic RASM will turn solidly positive in Q1. The domestic pricing environment is improving as underperforming airlines remove unprofitable capacity at an increasing rate and business traffic growth accelerates. Industry fare sales are less prevalent with lower discount rates as airlines are prioritizing profitability.\nAll United hubs were profitable in Q4 and for the last 12 months, with only a 7-point pretax margin difference between the best and the worst performing hub, the narrowest spread we recorded in a quarter since 2016. Our network health is very strong with room for margin expansion as we continue our United Next plan.\nAfter years of waiting, we're also finally starting to gain a critical mass of larger narrow-body aircraft, which allows us to execute on our plans to increase gauge. United international capacity was clearly the star of the quarter in terms of RASM growth relative to Q3. As a result, international margins continue to outpace domestic margins in 2024. United's plan during the pandemic was to double down on international client, and it's proven to be the right move.\nQ4 Pacific capacity moderated, and China headwinds slowed versus Q3 resulting in PRASM flipping from down 15.7% to up 4.1%. Pacific PRASM was up high single digits for the last 2/3 of the quarter versus last year. United has profitably digested a 31% increase in Pacific capacity in 2024, and we have now fully reinstated our prepandemic capacity levels across the region with margins that are now above system averages.\nIn the past, the Pacific margins routinely lagged. We plan to moderate our Pacific growth as we head into the first half of 2025 [indiscernible] capacity added in 2024 mature.\nDuring 2025, we are excited to launch a new initiative to operate 737s on a small number of Narita flights to destinations in Asia that do not support nonstop service to the U.S. We anticipate this unique initiative made possible by our Guam base will extend our lead as the largest trans-Pac carrier to build an unmatchable network scope. We're going to redeploy underperforming assets and efficiently grow load factors from Japan to the U.S. where local origin demand still has not fully recovered from the pandemic.\n2024 was also a great year for the United Atlantic network, and Q4 was no exception with PRASM up 7.1% on flat capacity. We entered 2024 [indiscernible] capacity growth for the year in the Atlantic after a rapid growth in the region post pandemic.\nOur plan for 2024 worked extremely well. All months in Q4 are PRASM positive year-over-year with December RASM up double digit. United is the largest U.S. carrier flying over the Atlantic by ASMs. And in 2025, we plan to have low to middle capacity growth in Q1 to support continued RASM strength. From what we see today, I expect the first quarter to be our best Atlantic financial result in the company's first quarter history.\nLatin America trailed the other regions throughout 2024. However, it's important to note that United continued to operate profitably in the region despite these challenges. PRASM was up slightly in Q4, and the outlook for early 2025 is positive.\nOverall, the momentum for international flying in the fourth quarter was exceptionally strong. We believe the [indiscernible] era global long-haul reset along with a sluggish delivery rate of new wide-body jets sets up the industry really well for years to come in international flying.\nCargo also had a very strong showing in 2024. Cargo revenues for the year were up nearly 17% and up almost 30% in Q4 versus last year. It was a very good quarter and year for cargo.\nThe business traffic recovery was a nice tailwind in Q4. Results in Q4 and our outlook for Q1 clearly shows this strength in higher yield corporate traffic volumes.\nFlown business revenue grew 16% in Q4 year-over-year. We expect that trend to continue in Q1, which is a tailwind for our business-focused network. Contracted business sales in the quarter for all future travel were up 14% year-over-year.\nPremium passenger revenues increased 10% year-over-year, and premium cabin unit revenues were positive. Both trends have persisted throughout the year. We see no change in consumer behavior seeking out increased premium experiences, but we also remain committed to our most basic product.\nIn Q4, Basic Economy passengers increased 21% year-over-year and now represents 2% of domestic passengers, up 2 points versus 2023. Loyalty revenues grew at a healthy pace at 12% in 2024. Co-brand spend was up 9% with 1 million new card acquisitions.\nTurning to the product. We reached a milestone of deployment of our signature interior with nearly 50% of the fleet were complete as of year-end 2024. With installation work moving quickly now, we expect to be at 70% by the end of 2025.\nAcross the entire United network, we expect to have 150,000 seat [indiscernible], full of rich content available to all of our passengers with a better ability to personalize everyone's experience by the end of 2025.\nAs you can see from our first quarter outlook, we continue to make progress on improving the financial performance of that quarter. Changes to our capacity deployment across hubs, days of week and time of day have been very effective. Return to more corporate traffic and the desirability of the Southern European vacation in the winter is also a tailwind.\nAs we announced a few weeks ago, we're tracking ahead of our schedule on Starlink installation, which we think will be a material advantage versus slower for-pay Wi-Fi services offered by other U.S. carriers. United's Starlink plan is yet one more action to elevate our product, creating a brand customers use more and more often.\nWe will share more on product innovation, merchandising and capacity optimization in the coming year, furthering our lead. We will also talk about how we believe Starlink will unlock a host of new digital benefits for our customers and shareholders. We believe that creating more choice, more segmentation and enhancing our products is the winning formula. Merchandising, sell-in and managing the complexity of these multiple experiences is our proven expertise.\nWith that, I want to say thanks to the entire United team for an amazing 2024, and I'll hand it off to Mike to talk about our financial results. Mike?\n\nMichael D. Leskinen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew. We delivered record fourth quarter earnings with earnings per share of $3.26 ahead of expectations and a fourth quarter pretax margin of 9.7%, up 3.5 points year-over-year. These strong fourth quarter results brought our full year earnings per share to $10.61, above the midpoint of our initial guidance range of $9 to $11.\nMuch of this success is due to the strong revenue performance that Andrew just discussed. But the foundation of our success is a strong operation, and I'm incredibly grateful for the tremendous efforts of our operations team this quarter.\nOur hubs are in some of the most congested airspace in the world, and still we delivered industry-leading operational performance during the quarter. Importantly, an operation that runs on time and with few cancellations is also a more cost-efficient operation.\nFinally, I'd like to celebrate our stock performance over the last 12 months. In 2024, we were the fourth best-performing stock in the S&P 500. I've long believed in the potential for [indiscernible] rate given the structural improvements in our business. It's nice that the market is beginning to recognize the shareholder value we've delivered.\nFor the first quarter of 2025, we expect earnings per share of $0.75 to $1.25, an approximately $400 million improvement from the first quarter of last year at the midpoint, implying an approximately 3.5 point improvement in pretax margin. The commercial team has done a great job of continuing to shape the network to match demand in what has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter.\nFurther building off first quarter momentum, we expect full year 2025 earnings per share to be between $11.50 and $13.50. At the midpoint, this represents 18% growth in earnings per share versus 2024.\nWe expect a similar pace of earnings growth is sustainable as we march toward low double-digit pretax margin. We've a decommoditized -- we have decommoditized air travel. Our operation is strong and the United Next plan continues to deliver both higher and more sustainable profits.\nAirlines with less competitive offerings are cutting money-losing routes and frequencies. The industry setup has never been better, and we believe United is uniquely positioned to succeed.\nOn costs, CASM-ex was up 5% on 6.2% capacity growth versus the fourth quarter of last year. As we look ahead to 2025, we are focused on driving efficiency improvements throughout the business while also improving the experience for our customers and enabling our employees to be more effective at their jobs. For the year, we continue to expect 2 to 3 points of CASM-ex pressure from our labor agreements not yet signed.\nShifting gears to the fleet. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of 5 Boeing MAX aircraft, 14 Airbus A321neo aircraft and 3 Boeing 787s. In 2025, we are planning to take delivery of 71 narrow-body aircraft and 10 wide-body aircraft.\nRecall, we had been planning for approximately 100 narrow-body aircraft deliveries in 2025. But due to the OEM production delays, we are planning for less, which leads to our expected full year CapEx spend to be below $7 billion. That's below the low end of our $7 billion to $9 billion multiyear guidance.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $17.4 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow.\nIn 2024, we paid down $7.4 billion of debt, $3.6 billion of which we voluntarily prepaid. We've now prepaid or refinanced our remaining high-cost COVID [indiscernible] debt, bringing our total cost of debt down to 4.6%. Our net leverage was 2.4x at year-end, an improvement as we make progress to our long-term net leverage target of less than 2x.\nOn to buybacks. In the quarter, we repurchased $81 million worth of shares, leaving over $1.4 billion left in the authorization. We remain firm believers that United stock is undervalued as we continue to grow earnings and margins year after year with further room for multiple expansion.\nFinally, I want to reiterate the consistent and growing free cash flow generation remains a top priority. And in 2025, we are targeting free cash flow around the $3.4 billion we delivered in 2024. The future at United Airlines has never looked brighter, and I'm excited to continue to build upon our competitive advantages in 2025 and beyond.\nNow back to Kristina to start the Q&A.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Mike. We will now take questions from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] Regina, please describe the procedure to ask a question."

My name is Brianna, and I will be your conference facilitator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.\nI will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Kristina Edwards, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Brianna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website at ir.united.com.\nInformation in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.\nUnless otherwise noted, we will be discussing our financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis on this call. Please refer to the related definitions and reconciliations in our press release. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release.\nJoining us on the call today to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Scott Kirby; President, Brett Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Leskinen. In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line and available to assist in the Q&A.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you, Kristina. The United team produced another solid quarter. We did that while further sharpening our focus on improving our already strong safety culture over the last several months.\nLooking at a wide variety of metrics, our airline is safer than ever before, with our culture rooted and constantly striving to make our airline safer for our employees and our customers. So we're continuing to work closely with the FAA and other partners to do exactly that.\nAdditionally, thank you to our employees for delivering top-tier operational performance amidst challenging weather, including Hurricane Barrel in Houston and getting our customers to their destinations safe and on time.\nWhile this is a quarter where industry capacity growth exceeded still solid demand, it was also a quarter that continued to show the industry developing along the lines that we've been anticipating for the past couple of years. The pressure other U.S. airlines are experiencing today is due in large part to their unprofitable flying in many domestic markets.\nIt was always inevitable that carriers would begin to cancel this unprofitable flying, and you see that happening in earnest in the second half of August in the schedules. As a result, it appears that the domestic industry capacity growth will moderate by roughly 5 points by the fourth quarter compared to where we were in the second quarter, which should provide a constructive setup as we close out the year and a particularly beneficial backdrop heading into 2025.\nSince COVID began in early 2020, United has consistently been ahead of the curve in the big picture developments driving the industry. We're running the best operation in our history despite operating in the most difficult hubs in the world, Chicago, Newark and San Francisco and despite having more exposure to the issues at Boeing than any other -- than any airline in the world.\nOur people are proud of United, and they have completely transformed the service and care for our customers. And we have the best commercial and revenue management teams in the world that are always on top of the demand environment, making strategic and technical adjustments to drive revenue.\nAnd the proof is in the pudding. We've now led the industry in domestic PRASM growth 3 years in a row. That cannot happen by accident. United Next was a great strategy, but a great strategy only works with great execution. And that has allowed us to structurally and permanently change our position within the industry.\nAnd while we are proud of our relative outperformance to the industry, we also know that our absolute results are all that really matter. They're solid right now, but I can already see the impact that the schedule changes are having on our advanced bookings and yields as we hit the mid-August industry capacity inflection point.\nAnd we are absolutely committed to our no excuses philosophy and controlling what we can to hit our guidance. And so while the industry is developing as we expected and our relative results are outperforming as we expected, we are not going to rely just on industry changes outside of our immediate control. We're also taking steps in the short term to ensure that we meet our targets. That includes aggressive cost management and reducing domestic capacity 300 basis points in the fourth quarter.\nThe industry rationalization that we expected is beginning to play out, and we've reached the inflection point. The United Next plan continues to be the winning strategy for United. And as a result, we continue to be -- to expect to be within our full year 2024 EPS guidance range of $9 to $11 despite the tough industry environment around us.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott, and good morning. This quarter, we continued to achieve record operational performance, delivering the best on-time performance, completion factor and seat cancellation rate for a second quarter since the pandemic, while flying the most passengers in the quarter ever in our history, over 44 million.\nLooking across our network, Newark, our largest hub, broke several of its own records in 2Q with its April and May on-time departures being the best in company history. The FAA waiver allowing for better balance between the number of flights and with the runways, facilities in aerospace and safely and efficiently handle at Newark has enabled us to produce these results for our customers.\nOperational excellence was not limited to Newark. Six out of our 7 hubs departed more on-time flights than our primary competitors. The improvements were made over the last year to adapt to a more challenging operating environment, have shown meaningful benefits to our reliability, particularly during times of the regular operations.\nOur strong operation, underpinned by our safety culture, is translating into an even better customer experience and driving efficiency benefits to the bottom line. This would not have been possible without the commitment to operational excellence from our frontline employees. So thank you to all of them for their hard work.\nAs I mentioned before, our strong operation is not only driving efficiency, but it is also positively impacting our customer experience. As a result, our NPS scores were the highest quarter -- highest second quarter results since the pandemic. We're investing in all aspects of our product, including the introduction of Tillamook ice cream on board our aircraft.\nAdditionally, the United app continues to be the most downloaded airline app with new features like seat preferences that automatically reseat customers when their preferred seat becomes available. This summer, we also started texting lag radar maps to customers during weather delays, so they can stay informed about how increment weather in one part of the country can impact their journey. Investment in our leading product and customer experience will remain a key priority to United and will continue to differentiate us as a premier global U.S. carrier.\nShifting gears to our employees, I'm pleased to share that after a brief pause in pilot and flight attendant hiring classes due to the Boeing delivery delays for the months of May and June, we resumed these classes in July. Looking ahead, we have a busy end of summer in front of us. The United team continues to innovate and adapt to a complex operating environment. While Andrew will describe some of the near-term trends, it's clear that United has a bright future, and we remain on track to deliver $9 to $11 in earnings per share this year.\nI'll now hand it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. United today reported total revenues in Q2 of $15 billion, up 5.7% year-over-year. TRASM was down 2.4% on 8.3% more capacity year-over-year. We expect United's year-over-year unit revenues in Q2 to be the best of all our large peers.\nDomestic PRASM fell by 1.9% on 5.3% more capacity. As widely discussed, unprofitable industry capacity that exceeded still solid demand put pressure on domestic PRASM in 2Q.\nInternational PRASM fell by 3.6% on 12% more capacity year-over-year. Flights across the Atlantic had a small PRASM gain, while flights to Latin America and Asia continue to see declines year-over-year. Cargo yields have also stabilized at higher levels than forecasted, which is helping cushion some of the PRASM declines we have seen.\nMileagePlus had another strong quarter with revenues up 13%. Our 3 key revenue segments continue to gain ground. United gained ground in our key markets among frequent business road warrior travelers, which we continue to believe is due to our no-change fee policy, our diverse set of products, our leading global network and our award winning MileagePlus program. Revenue from these road warriors was up 11% in the quarter, while total passenger revenue was up 5%.\nConsolidated premium revenues increased by 8.5% to $7.4 billion. Premium capacity was up 9.1%. Demand for United's premium capacity, including the Economy Plus, was strong in the quarter, outperforming non-premium seats.\nBusiness load factor contribution in the Polaris cabin increased year-over-year by 2.6 points. Polaris and premium plus RASMs were up 1.4 points year-over-year. We also continue to see strong demand for our premium domestic first-class product with sold load factors up 13 points versus 2019 and 8 points versus 2023.\nContracted business revenues were up 10% year-over-year. Basic Economy revenues remained strong and were up 38% year-over-year. United plans to continue to increase the total number of seats we offer in basic as we grow our mainline gauge. However, basic as a percent of sales will likely stay stable or decline as we continue to expand higher-margin premium capacity faster.\nWhen United offers basic fares for sale at competitive rates, we believe customers will always choose United first over a ULCC or an LCC, given the features of our product, which includes seat power and seatback entertainment along with the unmatched benefits of MileagePlus.\nQ2 revenue results for United and the industry did trail expectations. Looking back at the quarter now, it is increasingly clear that demand was, in fact, strong. It just could not keep up with the incremental industry domestic capacity added in 2024.\nExcess capacity, in turn, pressured yields. While July domestic industry capacity growth is published at similar levels to June, published capacity levels pivot in the second half of the quarter and beyond.\nBased on these schedules, we estimate that Q2 2024 industry scheduled domestic capacity increased by 6.6%. As we head into Q3, we expect July and the first half of August will look very much like June and Q2. We do see a step down in the second half of the quarter to 2.5% to 3% through the overall quarter at about 4%.\nWe also see the industry altering capacity on peak travel days more than usual later this summer. Peak day spill traffic is no longer filling up excess capacity on off-peak days such as Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday as it did in 2023 for leisure-focused, lower-margin airlines.\nWe can also see from our internal data that Latin America unit revenue trends have stabilized in Q3, and PRASM declines will moderate significantly for the first time since 2Q 2023. But Latin America and Deep South unit revenues were strong in Q2 and look good going forward.\nIn the third quarter, we do expect Pacific PRASM to remain negative. We do not lap our 2023 expansion wave until the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, we'll also lap China's return and expect more normal unit revenues from China, which is currently a material headwind in the region. Growth rates for the Pacific will also moderate as we end the year.\nWe expect premium cabin RASM in Q3 will once again outperform coach at a level stronger than Q2 as we continue to see growth of road warrior customers in United and the continued popularity of the many elevated products that we offer. Mid-August is clearly the pivot point we're expecting for some time as others race to adjust with what we believe is unprofitable flying heading into the period of seasonally less leisure demand.\nCompetitive capacity overlap on United nonstop routes peaked in Q2, which will also help build better unit revenues for the second half of 2024 for United. We believe it's clear in our internal advanced revenue data for August that the pivot will be beneficial to United.\nAdvanced PRASM for United are currently booked 4 to 5 points better in the second half of the quarter than the first. Unfortunately, this expected pivot occurs only for about half of Q3. So the revenue quality, we will continue to be impacted for the time being. We're encouraged by the yield improvement we see booked in the second half of the quarter.\nAs we look towards Q4, we estimate that industry domestic capacity will only be up about 1.5% to 2.5% based on what's currently offered for sale. On off-peak days, capacity could be flat year-over-year.\nWhile our relative results indicate that United Next plan is working, we have decided to cut approximately 300 basis points of planned domestic capacity in the fourth quarter. While there are many macro issues outside of our control, the amount of capacity we offer is within it. This change will help us accelerate RASMs we see in the second half of Q3 into Q4 and beyond.\nAs noted in our published schedules, we will be optimizing our capacity in Q4 by time of day and day week, similarly to what we did in Q1 of 2024, which was very successful in increasing our relative RASM results.\nWith that, I'll say a great thanks to the United team for another strong quarter with industry-leading financial and operational results. And I will hand it over to Mike to discuss our financial details.\n\nMichael D. Leskinen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew, and thank you to the United team for all of their hard work this busy summer season. In the second quarter, we delivered pretax income of $1.8 billion. Our earnings per share of $4.14 came in ahead of expectations driven by good cost performance.\nIn the quarter, we continued our no-excuses approach to managing the business to maximize profitability and to consistently deliver on our earnings guidance. The second quarter is another solid result despite some capacity headwinds to the industry. We have never been more confident that our United Next strategy is working. We've successfully differentiated our business, and that will support sustainably higher profitability.\nTurning to costs in the quarter. Unit costs, excluding fuel, were up 2.1% year-over-year on 8.3% capacity growth versus the second quarter of last year.\nOur strong second quarter CASM ex performance was driven by 3 factors. First, over the year, our operations team has invested in technology and improved their processes to better recover from irregular operations. Our ability to recover faster leads to a more reliable operation, and a more reliable operation is a more cost-efficient operation.\nNotably, crew-related disruption expenses such as premium pay and deadheading costs are much lower than we have seen during similar events in prior years. The full impact of these improvements drove approximately 1 point of CASM-ex improvement in 2Q compared to our own expectations.\nSecond, as yields softened throughout the quarter, we doubled down on expense management to ensure we hit our EPS guidance. As we've discussed before, we have a no-excuses mentality with respect to hitting our EPS guidance, and we will do what is necessary in the quarter to achieve that. These specific actions led to another 0.5 point of CASM-ex improvement in the quarter versus our plan.\nFinally, approximately 0.5 point of CASM-ex is associated with the timing of maintenance events, which were delayed and will likely be seen in the second half of 2024.\nAs we look to the third quarter, we expect industry capacity rationalization is beginning to take effect starting in mid-August. Money-losing flights across the industry are being cut rapidly, thus supporting our confidence in our trajectory for both the third quarter and the full year.\nOur own third quarter system capacity plan moderates by approximately 3 points versus the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. While this is the correct action to take for United, this reduction in capacity along with the impact from Hurricane Barrel in Houston puts pressure on CASM-ex and makes the third quarter the high point for CASM-ex for the year.\nAltogether, with the revenue backdrop that Andrew described, we expect our third quarter earnings per share to be in the $2.75 to $3.25 range. As for the full year, we continue to expect to fall within our original EPS range of $9 to $11.\nI realize that many of you will immediately point out that this implies a better-than-normal seasonal pattern for Q4 versus Q3 earnings per share. That's accurate, and it's what we expect. It has nothing to do with seasonality and everything to do with a better balance between supply and demand in the fourth quarter, which should lead to significantly higher yields and therefore, improved profitability.\nAndrew already touched on this, but I'd like to reiterate it. We aren't hoping for moderating industry supply. It's already happened, and you can see it in published schedules and with our own reductions. Despite the excess industry capacity, it's clear demand for the United product remains strong, and we expect our revenue growth to outperform the industry. Coupled with disciplined cost management, we expect United and one other airline to represent the vast majority of industry profits in 2024.\nOn the fleet, in the second quarter, we took delivery of 4 Boeing MAX aircraft, and 5 Airbus A321neo aircraft. We expect 66 aircraft deliveries in 2024. And with the movement of certain PDPs related to deliveries in future years, we now expect total adjusted capital expenditures to be less than $6.5 billion for the year.\nIn the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, while also continuing to invest in the business with almost $1 billion in capital expenditures. Earlier this month, we took advantage of this position to improve our balance sheet by voluntarily prepaying the $1.8 billion outstanding balance of MileagePlus term loan that had an interest rate near 11%. This reduction in high interest rate debt significantly reduces our interest burden.\nAs of the end of the quarter, our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 2.6x. I'm encouraged by our strong performance in the second quarter. Our team remains nimble as we've demonstrated our ability to adjust to an evolving environment.\nThanks to the whole United team for their hard work. The United Next plan continues to run on all cylinders, and our confidence has never been higher about the trajectory of our business.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Kristina to start the Q&A.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. We will now take questions from the analyst meeting. [Operator Instructions] Brianna, please describe the procedure to ask a question."

Please go ahead.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Christa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.\nAll forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.\nUnless otherwise noted, we will be discussing our financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis on this call.

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with Q&A. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kristina, and welcome, everyone, for the call today. Before we dive into our Q1 earnings performance, I want to start by talking about the issue that always comes first at United, safety. Safety is the fundamental pillar of our core for net safe, caring, dependable and efficient. And in that order. Safety is at the core of everything we do at our airline to make United success. As you've read, the FAA recently began evaluating several elements of our operations to ensure we're doing all we can to drive safety compliance.\nWe welcome the [indiscernible] engagement, and we are embracing this review as an opportunity to take our safety culture standards to an even higher level. As we undergo this review, I have confidence that, first, we have a strong foundation and a culture of safety here at United, including training, systems, processes and reporting culture. And that's backed up by our strong track record and the success of our safety protocols. Second, through the FAA review, I'm confident that we'll uncover opportunities to make our airline even safer.\nAt United, we have the best team of airline professionals in the world, and we're committed to embracing this opportunity to make the best airline in the world even better for our customers and employees. Now to our Q1 earnings. We delivered a strong first quarter, and it's clear the United next Plan continues to put our airline on a bright path. Notably, we saw a meaningful year-over-year margin improvement in the first quarter. And if the Boeing MAX 9 hadn't been grounded, we would have been profitable for the quarter.\nOur United next plan continues to demonstrate resilience and challenging industry conditions as we faced further significant aircraft delivery delays. These delays are driving temporarily higher costs this year but we've been able to find ways to offset most of those headwinds. On demand, we see continued positive momentum in bookings across all customer segments from the most price-sensitive customers to domestic road warriors and up to the premium global customer.\nOur cost management and clear demand for the United product continue to support our confidence in the United Next strategy and full year 2024 EPS of $9 to $11. In conclusion, I'm proud of the United team for delivering top-tier operational and financial results. Thank you for all the work you do that makes us the airline that customers choose to fly. And with that, I'll hand it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott, and good morning. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work this quarter as we navigated through the grounding of the Boeing MAX 9 fleet. We recovered well and got our customers to their destinations with limited disruption. As Scott mentioned, together with the FAA, we have begun an in-depth review of our processes and procedures. These reviews are being taken very seriously, and we will see this as an opportunity to further strengthen our commitment to safety.\nAs we work through this safety review with the FAA, certain certifications will be delayed. As a result of this, we expect a small number of aircraft scheduled for delivery in the second quarter to be delayed. We expect this to have a minimal impact to our 2024 capacity plans. I am confident that we will be able to successfully look back on this review process, resulting in an even better airline for our customers employees and shareholders.\nOn the employee front, we reached a tentative agreement with the IBT for a 4-year extension to their existing contract. We expect to hear if it is ratified by their membership in the next few days. Taking a look at our operation. In the first quarter, we delivered top-tier service for our customers. We had our second best on-time departure performance in the first quarter in our history excluding pandemic years.\nThis resulted in being second in the industry and on time to [indiscernible] for the seventh month in a row. Additionally, our widebody operation had the company's best on-time performance since the pandemic. We accomplished all of this while having the price seat factor for any first quarter in our history. This is a great testament to the hard work of our team. In addition to strong operational performance, we also continue to make customer enhancements that have driven up our Net Promoter Scores. Some of these include continuing to retrofit our existing mainline fleet with signature interiors that feature larger overhead bins in-flight entertainment and every seat back and Bluetooth connectivity.\nSignature interior aircraft were 9 points higher in on-time NPS compared to the rest of the narrow-body fleet, and we are on track for 50% of our North America fleet that have signature interiors by the end of the year. We were the first U.S. airline to offer Mileage Plus pooling, allowing customers to share and use miles with their friends and families. We've also partnered with the TSA to launch TSA Precheck touchless ID at Ohara and LAX, which uses biometrics to enable customers to pass through the TSA line faster and without having to pull out their ID.\nRunning a reliable operation and enhancing the customer experience continues to differentiate United. These encouraging operational results and improved Net Promoter Scores combined with our focus on safety by creating strong momentum for the rest of 2024. I will now turn it over to Andrew to talk about the revenue environment.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. United's revenue and financial performance will be top tier in Q1. And as Scott and Brett mentioned, we also had strong operational results. Without the ground into the MAX 9, we clearly would have produced a profit in the quarter. Looking back at 2023, we did have a great year, particularly in Q2 and Q3. However, United's relative financial performance in Q1 of 2023 did not meet our expectations. Improve in United's absolute and relative Q1 margin is something we're very focused on to achieve our long-term financial targets. Q1 has always been our most challenged quarter financially, post-pandemic Q1 seasonality worsened due to decreases in corporate business.\nFor the first quarter of 2024, we took the lessons from 2023 and carefully refined our commercial plan with encouraging results. A few of our domestic capacity changes in Q1 included Florida capacity increased 20% with financial results well above our system average. Las Vegas capacity increased 7%, again, with strong financial results. Margins on off-peak, early AM and Lake PM flights improved by 12 points year-over-year and margins on off-peak days improved by 11 points driven by United changes and industry changes.\nIn making these changes to how we deploy capacity in Q1, we sacrificed about 1 point of narrow-body utilization year-over-year. But in exchange, we offered a schedule that was more attractive to passengers with better departure and arrival times and more profitable for United, lower utilization also enhanced our reliability. We believe our Q1 2024 results set United up for producing profitable first quarters in the upcoming years and show our agility on adjusting our plan to meet new challenges.\nTurning to our overall revenue performance in the first quarter. Revenue increased 9.7% on 9.1% more capacity consolidated TRASM was up 0.6% and PRASM was up 1%. Domestic PRASM increased 6.1%, which we expect to be industry-leading year-over-year while international PRASM was down 4.2%. Domestic revenue results were also well above our expectations on strong demand and did help offset lower RASM year-over-year from global flying and Latin America.\nUnited's domestic RASM gains since 2019 lead the industry even with United having the largest increase in aircraft gauge of any U.S. airline. United's domestic network has been starved of gauged historically. I think our domestic RASM results in Q1 yet again showed that not all industry capacity is created equally, considering the marginal RASM performance of growth ASMs at other airlines versus United. Cargo revenue decreased 1.8% year-over-year, and we're hopeful that this is the last year-over-year decline we'll see in the near term.\nMileagePlus had another strong quarter with revenue up 15% and United's premier frequent flyer new members are more engaged than ever by flying and using one of our co-brand credit cards. Managed corporate travel in Q1 was up 14% year-over-year yields for managed travel will be faster than non-managed travel due to stronger close-in pricing and refined discounting guidelines. The strength of the business traffic rebound is a nice development for an airline like United.\nLatin American PRASM was down 12.7%. Weakness was felt in near Latin America markets for the most part versus South America. We are pleased with our capacity growth across Pacific where capacity was up 66% and PRASM was down 12.9%. However, we do plan to make capacity adjustments to a small number of underperforming routes later this year. Q1 performance for United's Atlantic line was up with strong PRASM 11% up. We saw a material rebound in London where Polaris revenues were up 8% on 11% less capacity.\nWe saw weakness to Germany offset by strength in Southern Europe and Africa where we increased capacity. United's efforts to build our brand and premium product choices while reducing customer friction is having a noticeable positive impact on our results as we gain share across the network for leisure and business travelers. For our road [ warrior ] or frequent flyer business customers, United elimination of change fees, the functionality or app to manage their entire travel experience improvements to MileagePlus and the steady increase in United Club facilities has resulted in improving share.\nHowever, we cannot understate the importance of the elimination of change fees, which is a game changer for how people feel about United. United's focus on premium products has matched well with increased consumer demand for our premium seat choices. We believe this focus has diversified and made our revenues less cyclical in the long run. Premium passenger revenue mix improved 1.9 points versus Q1 2023 and 3 points versus Q1 2019.\nIn other words, we're seeing near-term acceleration. Premium revenues were up 14% year-over-year on 10% more capacity, and we estimate that United's premium revenue streams lead the industry. While our largest focus is on growing premium revenues, we also believe our rollout of Basic Economy is a critical competitive tool and important to attracting customers of all types in our core geography. Basic Economy sales trends in Q1 were up 35% year-over-year.\nBasic has clearly changed our competitive stance versus the ULCCs. Larger narrow-body jets are also increasing United [ gates ] faster with more premium fees than any other U.S. airline. We are absorbing this gauge increase well, which can be easily measured in our continued domestic RASM growth relative to others. We continue to plan for further gauge growth between 2025 and 2027 with our expanded MAX 9 and A321 fleet. Other product innovations are planned with the goal of increasing choice for customers, expanding premium revenue streams and segmented demand. United gauge growth will also create further cost convergence. More importantly, gauge growth provides consumers a wide range of premium seat choices that they want and that we have proven we can monetize.\nFor Q2, we continue to see strong domestic and Atlantic demand with positive RASM results tempered by the Pacific where we expect a negative result year-over-year. We also expect Latin America will have a materially negative PRASM result year-over-year in the quarter. As we think about the second half of 2024, we do like the macro setup, particularly for domestic capacity where we think we can continue RASM growth above industry average.\nWe are focused on building connectivity in our core non-coastal hubs in 2024 with both new mainline jets and with enhanced RJ capabilities. With that, I wanted to congratulate the entire United team on a job well done and turn over the call to Mike to discuss our financial results and updated fleet plan. Mike?\n\nMichael D. Leskinen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew, and thank you to the United team for the tremendous effort as we work through the grounding of the Boeing MAX 9 fleet and entered the peak spring break travel season. In the first quarter, we produced a pretax loss of $79 million, a $187 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Our loss per share of $0.15 was better than our guidance, and well ahead of consensus expectations, driven by both strong revenue results and disciplined expense management.\nThe grounding of the Boeing MAX 9 fleet negatively impacted our earnings by more than $200 million and without it, we would have had a profitable quarter. We also generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow and our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR of 2.7x is back to pre-pandemic levels. These are strong results in what is our seasonally weakest quarter, and they provide another proof point that our United. Next Plan is working. Before I turn to the outlook, I'd like to address the changes we made with Boeing and Airbus, to optimize the delivery skyline.\nBoeing's repeated delivery delays had created an impractical bow wave of aircraft deliveries that both United to address and we have. In 2024, we now expect to take delivery of 61 narrow-body aircraft and 5 wide-body aircraft. This compares to our contractual deliveries of 183 narrow-body aircraft at year-end and the 101 aircraft we were planning for at the start of the year. Due to these fleet changes, we now expect full year 2024 total capital expenditures to be approximately $6.5 billion down from $9 billion at the start of the year.\nWe've also made changes to level out our fleet plan for 2025 through 2027. This modified fleet plan allows us to execute on our long-term goals while also smoothing out the pace of deliveries and our annual CapEx spend. We've converted a near-term portion of our MAX 10 deliveries scheduled through 2027 into MAX 9s. Additionally, we have signed letters of intent to lease 35 new Airbus A321neos with CFM engines scheduled for delivery in 2026 and 2027.\nWith these changes, we now anticipate taking delivery of approximately 100 narrow-body aircraft on average each year during this 3-year period. This delivery schedule provides fleet renewal, steady growth and addresses the bow wave of aircraft delivery delays that had been building. These changes bring our total adjusted capital expenditures in 2025 through 2027 and to the $7 billion to $9 billion range in each of those years.\nBalancing our United next growth plan and managing the business towards positive free cash flow remain top priorities. And with the rebalanced skyline, we are targeting positive and growing free cash flow over the next 3 years. While we will provide an updated long-term earnings target later this year, we are confident we are on a path to higher earnings, better margins and materially stronger free cash conversion.\nNow turning to costs. Unit costs trended as expected during the quarter and were up 4.7% year-over-year on 9.1% capacity growth. As I mentioned, it was challenging to re-optimize our expenses with the uncertainty created by the MAX grounding and continued delays to our aircraft deliveries. While our underlying costs are consistent with our forecast at the beginning of the year, it's important to understand that the continued reduction in capacity from delivery delays will continue to temporarily pressure our CASM-ex for all of 2024. As we entered the year, we built a business plan for a larger airline. -- and deliveries have fallen more than 40 aircraft short of our expectations.\nWe continue to incur most of the expenses as we hired for that capacity despite flying fewer ASMs and it is driving almost a point of CASM-ex pressure. We are working diligently to reduce these costs as much as possible, and our higher completion factor has helped offset some of it. For the second quarter, we expect CASM-ex to be similar on a year-over-year basis versus the first quarter. Given our expectation for costs and our current outlook for revenue and fuel, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be between $3.75 and $4.25.\nWe have great momentum. Our United next plan is working and the future for United and our industry has never looked brighter. Our margins are already near the top of the industry, and we still have significant and unique network and gauge opportunities in front of us. United has never been in a stronger competitive position. We have developed a wide variety of products that are compelling to a wide variety of customers. And as a result, they are increasingly choosing to fly United.\nI remain excited about our future and believe we're firmly on track to deliver $9 to $11 in earnings per share this year. With that, I'll pass it over to Kristina to start the Q&A.\n\nKristina Munoz Edwards\n\nManaging Director of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. We will now take questions from the analyst community.

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with the Q&A.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristina, and good morning to everyone on the call today. Despite the numerous geopolitical and other headwinds around the globe, 2023 really was a year that our plan for United Next came together. Our thesis at this time last year was that operational constraints and other factors were leading to cost converters, and those cost pressures in turn would lead to higher revenue. That is certainly true for United because our diversified revenue streams continued to differentiate us from other airlines.\nAnother way of saying that is that we believe that a Newark link between United's CASM and RASM was being solidified. And while I'd be hard to get either a CASM or RASM for guests exactly correct, we could have higher confidence in forecasting the relationship between the 2, and therefore, we have higher confidence in our earnings and margin forecast. And is by the year, build on the best that we could have never predicted. That's exactly what happened in 2023.\nAnd so I'd like to thank the 100,000 United team members around the world who worked so hard to make that. And those same with 100,000 people continue to deliver in the face of huge impacts on our voice and customers from the MAX 9 [indiscernible]. I'm proud of our tech ops, who's taken the lead and has been working 18-hour days nonstop since January to ensure that the MAX 9 is 100% safe before we return it to service.\nI'd also like to thank the FAA for their professional leadership in this situation and also acknowledge that they too are also working long hours and weekends with us, in an effort to ensure that we know for sure what happens so that we'd be confident that the remediation prevents it from ever happening again.\n2023 really sets the stage for what is likely to be a repeat in 2024. United financial performance was impressive, especially considered for analysts were expecting just 1 year ago.\nIn 2023, we delivered full year earnings per share above $10, which was within the range of our initial United targets of $10 to $12. I want to spend some time today examining how we got there and why we think those trends will persist in 2024.\nOne, we expect the operating environment to be challenging, driven by pilots and other hiring constraints, FAA, air traffic control set, maintenance catch-up and supply chain issues. It turned out to be even more challenging than we thought. Two, and those operating environment challenge led directly to industry capacity plans, including our own coming down 3 points on average as carriers adopted to the new operating environment.\nFor United, we made changes to our schedule and we closed out the year setting operational records. The improvements in Newark, in particular, are one of the most important accomplishments that we achieved last year. Brett will share more detail in just a moment, but the FAA waivers rightsize the airport and aerospace, to physical constraints that allowed us to run an operation that is performing better than ever in Newark. That's been good for our business, and it's been really good for our customers.\nThree, but as we predict the challenging operating environment led to cost pressures and cost conversions in the industry, to be bear, even we at United underestimated, the inflationary pressures that we would face primarily from labor, maintenance and supply chain issues, and that led to higher absolute CASM-ex than we were forecast. But those same cost pressures are being [indiscernible] across the entire industry. And a year ago, when we talked -- we believe the industry-wide cost pressures will wind up as a pass-through, much like fuel have been in the past.\nFour, and that is, in fact, exactly what happened.\nWhile industry cost pressures drove higher CASM-ex at United, we offset those higher-than-expected costs with higher-than-expected revenues.\nFive, which leads to the final point. while difficult to predict events like the fuel price spike, rising conflicts in the Middle East, fires in Mali, persisting inflationary pressure. So many other things that make it difficult to predict United's full year 2023 CASM in rather than 12 months in advance. The timing connection at United between CASM and RASM meant that we achieved our initial $10 to $12 EPS range despite those multiple headwinds around the globe.\nThe link between RASM and CASM combined with the success of United Next, [indiscernible] May 2023 such a successful and important year in our history, and we expect 2024 to follow a similar path for the same reasons. This is just the new normal. The operational challenges remain. It will be years before the FAA is back to full staffing. We're still overlapping new labor agreements, which shows in our CASM and the supply chain challenges aren't going away anytime soon. That means capacity will continue to ratchet down out of necessities and cost convergence will continue. But revenues will adjust to the new cost reality, and you can expect United to maintain and grow EPS and margins.\n2.5 years ago, we laid out our United Next growth strategy. In 2023, we demonstrated that the plan is working almost exactly as we expected in the future is bright. There have been and there will be more bumps in the road. But we continue to feel confident about our ability to grow earnings and margin over the long term because of the tighter connection between United's cost and United's revenue.\nLooking ahead to 2024, the United Next plan is working and no airline is better positioned to capitalize on industry and macroeconomic trends in United, and we're continuing to move aggressively to capitalize on emerging opportunities. We'll have more to share with you at our Investor Day later this spring.\nIn the meantime, we're focused on delivering another great year for our employees and customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott, and good morning. As of Saturday, January 6, Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft has been grounded. We are currently the largest operator of the Boeing [indiscernible] fleet type aircraft representing approximately 8% of our capacity in the first quarter. Our financial guidance assumes that United 79 MAX 9 aircraft is grounded in January.\nI echo Scott's gratitude for all United who worked so hard travel plans were affected by the grounding of our MAX 9 fleet. I'm also extremely proud of our TechOps team, who we're working carefully to ensure the safety of our MAX 9 aircraft before we start flying them again. 2023 was a year of growth and restoration. And we closed out the year with strong record-breaking operational results, carrying a record 171 million customers.\nThe fourth quarter consolidated customer D0, A0 and misconnect rate were the best for any quarter in our history. Not only did we set company records for the quarter, but we also ran record-setting operations during our busiest time of the year over Thanksgiving and Christmas.\nThanksgiving and the entire fourth quarter had the highest NPS scores in our post-pandemic history. We wrapped up the year with our lowest ever cancel rate for the month of December. One of the largest challenges United and all airlines flying to and from New York have historically faced more flights than air traffic and the air traffic system can handle is now being addressed, thanks to proactive intervention by the FAA.\nNewark, United's largest hub has been operating with the best reliability on record since the FAA mandated that flight activity to be consistent with the aerospace and runway limitations of no more 77 operations per hour this fall. For United, that meant we reduced flight activity from Newark by about 10%. Expect to continue with those cuts for the remainder of 2024. Our customers and every passenger flying from New York are now benefiting and the cascade of delays that historically would flow across the United States from New York airspace has significantly improved.\nOur customer D0 from Newark the company record 76% in Q4 of 2023. We expect this level of performance to continue as long as the FAA continues to mandate the flat operations remain at 77 or fewer operations per hour going forward. United plans to continue to upgauge our Newark flying to ensure that there is plenty of capacity available for our customers even with fewer flights.\n2023 was also a banner year for employee recruiting, hiring and retention at United. On the heels of hiring more than [ 21,000 ] people in 2022, we hired another 16,000 aviation professionals to our airline last year. We hire the best of the best. The skill and talent of our employees played a big role in our operational performance -- outperformance in the second half of the year. Our record-breaking customer scores during the holidays and our overall financial performance as an airline in 2023.\nWe are a better, more successful airline because of our people. And I'm proud of the way we've gone about growing our team. I'm happy to announce we will be paying our eligible employees, $81 million in profit sharing next month. This is 5x higher than 2022, and over 2x higher than the average of the last 10 years. Our team will be the part of this airline profit sharing [indiscernible] these impressive results today without them.\nWith that, I will pass it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. As Scott mentioned, op pressures led to healthy revenue trends in the quarter with stellar performance over the holidays. Total revenues in the fourth quarter increased 9.9% on a 14.7% increase in capacity. Consolidated TRASM was down 4.2% and PRASM was down 3.3% for the quarter. Domestic demand was strong in the quarter and PRASM results were slightly negative year-over-year, a nice improvement from the third quarter.\nAtlantic PRASM growth in Q4 of positive 3.8% was consistent with Q3 year-over-year growth of 4%. We also experienced a small but measurable demand weakness period across for Europe in Q4 triggered by the conflict of Israel, but that has now moderated. United increased Asia Pacific flying by 82% in the quarter. PRASM was down 11.6% year-over-year.\nIn the quarter, we increased flying to China from 4 weekly flights to twice daily. Amongst many other changes we've now fully restored our capacity to pre-voted levels across the Pacific. Latin American unit revenues decreased by 11.6% in the quarter, pressured by record industry capacity levels and heavy fare discounting. Cargo revenues continue to adjust to their new city state post-pandemic state. For 2023, cargo revenues were $1.5 billion, 31% lower than 2022. Amongst all the revenue changes due to yields, not volumes.\n[indiscernible] Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TRASM in Q1 to be approximately flat year-over-year, which is a nice sequential improvement versus the past few quarters. Domestic demand remains strong with increases in business traffic volumes year-over-year in addition to stronger pricing thus far this year, and we expect domestic year-over-year PRASM to be positive for the quarter. We see the best yield growth occurring on tickets purchased within a week of departure.\nBookings and yields for Atlantic fly in early 2024 are also strong and we expect these trends to continue into the second and third quarters. Service to Tel Aviv will resume as soon as it's safe for our customers and crew but no sooner than February 15.\nWe also saw a nice step-up in London Heathrow business demand in recent weeks, which has helped in Atlantic results in Q1 to date when combined with lower United capacity to London. We remain focused on slow growth across the Atlantic for 2024. Asia Pacific growth remains above normal as we head into Q1, we continue to absorb the incremental Asia Pacific capacity added in 2023. We expect all of United's new Asia capacity to produce strong margin results as we head into Q2 and Q3.\nLatin American RASM is expected to remain negative for Q1 year-over-year, a trend that's likely to continue into Q2. FAA imposed industry capacity limitations on New York for virtually all of 2024 and San Francisco for most of 2024 will limit capacity from either airport. We've prioritized international growth over domestic at both hubs. We're optimistic that the demand will catch up with supply in 2024 in these 2 United hubs that have lagged the recovery elsewhere.\nIn summary, we expect strong unit revenue performance on domestic and Atlantic capacity in early 2024, with weaker results in Asia as we absorb 2023 growth and in Latin America due to record industry capacity growth levels.\nWhile we expect international RASMs will grow slower than domestic for a period, we also expect that international flying will have materially higher margins for United versus domestic in 2024 or just less of a gap than in 2023. We, at United, have I think, created a really very durable commercial model that has diversified our revenue streams and our network and largely decommoditized our product versus just about every other airline in the U.S. maybe for the exception of one. Our commercial strategy has resulted in fair levels at United just in -- not only for changes in price of fuel, but also for the cost inputs at United, allowing us to overcome the inflationary cost pressures larger than we expected in 2023. You can see this in our relative revenue performance quarter-to-quarter.\nUnited unique hub system in the largest U.S. cities and the network we have built over decades from these hubs underpins our outlook and gives United access to revenues and profitable flying others simply do not have or have not been able to replicate. The United Next fleet growth in recent years has allowed us to unlock the true value in our hub system, which you can see from our results today. unique aircraft cabin and capacity plans continue to be a driver of our strong revenue performance, particularly as demand for premium products remains elevated.\nFor example, domestic premium revenue grew 13% year-over-year in Q4, over double the rate of coach, another data point validating our strategy. While we remain focused on monetizing our growing premium capacity, we also remain committed to Basic Economy. Domestic Basic Economy revenue was up nearly 20% in the fourth quarter versus last year. Correct engage deficits at United remains a key component of the future. We continue to believe we can add gauge to domestic flying while maintaining strong unit revenues.\nSince 2019, United has increased its North American gauge by 22%, while also leading in PRASM growth. For 2024, we intend to focus much of our domestic growth in our Mid-Con hubs in Washington, Dallas, as we had significant levels of new connectivity. This connectivity change is why we have confidence in the RASM being accretive in 2024. Diversified revenue streams across our global network remain key to our relative success as we implement our United Next plans. United's global network is a key structural advantage we will focus on in the coming years, and it differentiates us.\nWith that, I wanted to say thanks to the entire United team and hand it over to Mike to discuss our financial results. Mike?\n\nMichael D. Leskinen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew, and thank you to the whole United team for closing up the year on a high note, both operationally and financially.\nI'm proud to report that in 2023, we delivered pretax income of $4.3 billion, a more than $3.2 billion improvement over 2022. We delivered earnings per share of $10.05 within our initial guidance range of $10 to $12, and well ahead of consensus expectations of about $6 at the beginning of the year. We achieved this despite significant industry headwinds and operational constraints that led to lower capacity.\nFor the fourth quarter, we delivered pretax income of $845 million and earnings per share of $2, ahead of consensus and above the high end of our guidance range. Strong operational performance, robust revenue trends and a decrease in fuel prices supported these results.\nFourth quarter CASM-ex was up 4.9% as we did not operate flight to Tel Aviv for the full quarter. Additionally, effective with the fourth quarter, we are now classifying certain commissions that has been classified as contra-revenue and distribution expense. This has no impact on net income or cash flow. This change added 1 point to our year-on-year fourth quarter CASM-ex and increased fourth quarter year-on-year unit revenue by 0.6 points. The change will also result in an approximate 1 point headwind to year-on-year CASM-ex in an approximate 0.6 point increase in RASM through the end of the third quarter of this year.\nUnderlying unit costs trended favorably during the quarter as the completion factor came in better than planned due to our strong operational performance. Compared to 2019, our relative performance on CASM-ex was near the top of the industry. As Scott outlined, delivering strong relative cost performance remains critical to the successful execution of United Next.\nWe have always ascertained the costs that are borne by the entire industry are passed along in prices with a lag. Historically, this relationship has been clear with jet fuel prices. More recently, the relationship has been clear for both higher labor and higher maintenance costs as well.\nNotably, our unit cost in 2023 were up 17.8% versus 2019. The compared to ultra low-cost carriers unit costs that are expected to be up 25% on average. That more than 7-point cost convergence and costs occurred simultaneous with an emerging preference for United product. The top-tier operational reliability that United provides. The result is unsurprising. Our margins have dramatically and structurally improved, and we're only in the early innings of [indiscernible].\nFor the first quarter of 2024, we expect a loss per share between negative $0.35 and negative $0.85. While our core costs remain on track, our first quarter CASM-ex faces a few headwinds.\nFirst, the cancellations of the MAX 9 flights have reduced first quarter capacity. Due to the close in nature of these canceled assets, most of our expenses are fixed. And we also incurred additional interrupted trip expenses. We expect the combination of these items will increase CASM-ex by approximately 3 points.\nSecond, as we mentioned that the contra-revenue reclassification in the distribution expense is a 1 point headwind.\nThird, the impact of new labor agreements as they annualize as an additional 3 to 4 points.\nAnd fourth, a higher volume of engine events and continued supply chain challenges lead to another 1 point of CASM-ex headwind.\nWhile the first 2 items I mentioned are United-specific headwinds, labor and maintenance are an industry-wide issue, and the primary drivers of the cost conversions that Scott described earlier.\nMost importantly, we're confident that the pace of inflation in our costs will continue to be favorable versus our historically lower cost competitors.\nBuilding off of our 2023 momentum, we expect full year 2024 earnings per share to be between $9 to $11. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing and our United Next plan is working well. This is our guidance, but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that our internal targets are higher. We plan to update our longer-term financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day.\nLooking ahead, we intend to take a different approach to guidance. As demonstrated in 2023 and just recently with the MAX grounding, we operate in a dynamic industry. With the no excuses philosophy, we intended to take United off the detailed quarterly metrics shortly after I joined and led the Investor Relations team. The pandemic interrupted those plans, but now that we're pass the crisis, and as we deliver on our earnings per share target, you should expect us to remove TRASM, CASM-ex and capacity guidance and focus on earnings per share.\nWe've provided RASM and TRASM for the first quarter, but this is likely the last time we will do so for our quarter. We will continue to provide fulsome commentary on the trends impacting our business. and we will continue to be transparent with our views of the longer-term future for both United and the industry that we're managing this business towards. We will earn your confidence by delivering bottom line results.\nShifting gears to the fleet. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of 20 Boeing MAX and 4 Airbus A321 aircraft. Looking ahead to 2024, we have a total of 107 aircraft scheduled to deliver, 31 of those being maximized. It is unrealistic at this time to believe all of those aircraft will deliver as currently planned.\nWe also have 277 MAX 10 aircraft on order through the remainder of the decade and an additional 200 auctions for MAX 10 aircraft. We are monitoring Boeing's progress towards certification and [indiscernible] closely. At this time, our current aircraft delivery schedule would lead to a total CapEx of approximately $9 billion in 2024. But given the MAX 9 grounding and the continued supply chain issues, there is a downward bias to our 2024 spend. We also expect a reduction in orders and deliveries from Boeing in 2025. This will require reworking of our fleet plan, and we will share the details when that work is complete.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $16.1 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 2.9x, consistent with our leverage target of less than 3x provided at the start of the year. Managing the business towards positive free cash flow will be a top priority for our team over the coming years. Our stock is deeply undervalued, trading at less than 4x earnings despite the fact that we delivered 19.5% revenue growth and realized significant structural improvement in relative profitability in 2023.\nBut we also understand the generating free cash flow consistently even while we execute our United Next strategy is an important component to increasing our valuation. 2023 marked the first full year of United Next plan. We are thrown some curve balls, but we adapted quickly and exited the year stronger than ever. It's clear that when customers are given a choice, they are choosing United. You can see it clearly in our revenue and margin performance relative to the industry.\nFinally, I'm happy to announce we will be hosting an Investor Day on May 1st in Chicago. We plan to provide an update on our progress with the United Next plan and introduce some of the United tailwinds that will drive continued margin expansion and sustainable free cash flow. I'm encouraged by our results in a relative momentum, and I'm looking forward to delivering another solid year for our employees, customers and shareholders.\nWith that, I will pass it over to Kristina to start the Q&A."

I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Kristina Edwards, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKristina Munoz\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Silas. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company.\nA number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Unless otherwise noted, we will be discussing our financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis on this call. Please refer to the related definitions and reconciliations in our press release. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release. Joining us on the call today to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Scott Kirby; President, Brett Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Leskinen. In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with the Q&A. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristina. I want to start today by saying how heartbroken we are by the horrific attacks on Israel and the escalating conflict in the region that has millions of innocent people in harm's way. here at United with tragedy strike anywhere around the world, we focus first on safety and second on how we can use our unique capabilities to help. While we suspended our service to Tel Aviv, we were the first U.S. carrier to add extra flights to Athens where customers connect from airlines operating between Tel Aviv and Athens. We also updated some regularly scheduled flight to Athens added a dedicated Tel Aviv support desk continued play to [indiscernible] to maximize flexibility for our customers with ticket to Tel Aviv. We're closely monitoring the situation on the ground and staying in close touch with state department officials so that we can resume service as soon as possible.\nWe look forward to the cessation of violence in the region and as we've done in the past crisis around the globe, we expect United to continue to play a meaningful role in the humanitarian response. Turning back to the business. I want to start by welcoming Mike to the leadership team. You all know him well that I'm excited to have him as a partner who agrees with my no-excuses approach who is 100% committed to making United work for our employees, customers and shareholders. I also want to congratulate Kristina for recent announcement as from Cranes here in Chicago as one of the top 40 under 40. The third quarter was another solid milestone to demonstrate that United Next is working as we expected, and the growth we are adding is profitable.\nThough fuel spiked this quarter we're very encouraged about our results. It's clear to see why from the numbers. Our top line revenue grew 12.5% to $14.5 billion, making it at the highest third quarter in our history. Our costs were also on track with our plan as we delivered strong operations in both August and September. United's diverse revenue streams have also allowed us to handle variations in demand and produce solid absolute even better relative results. It's evident in the numbers. United and one other airline expected to account for 98% of the total industry revenue growth this quarter and over 90% of the industry's total pretax profitability.\nEven in a tough industry environment, United's diverse model is building strong, absolute even more impressive relative margins. So what is it about revenue diversity that makes us different. First, because of our size and industry-leading global network, our loyalty program is the most attractive program in the world for customers and therefore, generate significantly directly earned EBIT, significant loyalty but also a significant opportunity to do even more with it in the future. Expect to hear a lot more details from us on this front starting at an Investor Day in early 2024.\nSecond, we have unmatched geographic diversity with a large domestic network complemented by the largest long-haul international network and both are solidly profitable. While this is a great attribute it does create some short-term risk and volatility as we're seeing right now with the transitory hit to margins this quarter as a result of the tragedy in Israel. Third, we feel both business travelers, and it's been nice to see recent momentum in that segment, but also increasingly the leisure customers as well. We've got a lot more agile at pivoting capacity in the leisure market and not surprisingly have found that our core customers can now fly us in both business and leisure markets as we add seat-side destination.\nOur ability to move domestic capacity in the leisure markets when they're strong is a consequential driver of our strong relative revenue performance. And fourth, we continue to advance and improve our segmentation efforts. This is a project almost a decade in the making, but all the way from basic economy, which allows us to compete profitably on price on the low end and all the way up to Polaris on long-haul international, United is able to give our customers the real choice they want.\nSo what does that mean going forward? In short, it's a confirmation that United Next is working as we expected. We thought the industry operating environment would be difficult. We thought that medium-term capacity aspirations would be higher than demand growth. We thought that domestic would be a lot tougher than international in the short to medium term. But we also thought United would win share, grow our gauge and grow our connectivity, and that would allow United specifically to improve our results.\nBy the way, we also expect and now believe will happen even faster that the domestic market is going to see a shakeout that leads to an improvement in margins over the medium to long term. It's impossible to call the timing exactly. But I guess that we see meaningful industry changes about 2H '24. And for what it's worth, that's what has happened every single time we've been through one of these cycles in my career. And as that is happening, aisle continue closely tracking the airline industry revenue to GDP relationship. I've talked about this in the past, but that ratio declined by approximately 35% in the past few decades.\nI don't think we'll make all that up, but almost everything we do make up goes straight to the bottom line. So in conclusion, I'm proud of the team at United. We're creating something special here. Even in a tough industry environment, we're producing strong absolute results while producing the best relative results in our history. We believe we have a lot of runway ahead of us with United Next and our diverse revenue streams along with our ability to catch up on Engage and connectivity position United well.\nWe expect that the current stress and segments of the industry is also going to lead to structural changes that lay the foundation for an even better future for United, our employees, our customers and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott. And thank you to each member of the United team. Your dedication is what continues to propel us to the top. I also want to acknowledge the tragic conflict in Israel. At United, our top priority is the safety of our crews and customers. We are closely monitoring the situation. While in our coordination with the State Department, we have suspended flights to Tel Aviv until the end of October, and we are offering waivers to impacted customers. We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust as needed.\nMike will provide more detail on the impact of these capacity investments shortly. Last quarter, we announced changes to our operation at Newark to better hedge against disruptions, including taking advantage of FAA granted waivers to reduce our flight schedule along for necessary airspace relief in the highly congested region. While July was a difficult weather month the Newark waivers and other proactive measures to improve reliability helped avoid pre-pandemic levels of ATC-related delays. In the third quarter, delayed arrivals were down 16 points versus the third quarter of 2019.\nAdditionally, in August, we had the fewest cancels of August in history, while operating the third largest quarter wide-body schedule effort. In September, the FAA granted extensions to the New York airspace waivers, allowing the ability to maintain a reduced flight schedule at Newark that will help minimize air traffic delays through the rest of the year. The flexibility enabled by waivers are proving to be successful in ensuring operational reliability and resiliency at our largest international hub and have meaningfully improved the travel experience for our customers traveling in and out of Newark and throughout our network.\nLooking to our system operations. During the quarter, we carried over 482,000 revenue passengers daily. The most in any quarter in United's history. The top-tier system customer D00 in August and September. We're grateful to the FAA for allowing us to make necessary adjustments in Newark work and thank our employees who worked hard to get our customers to their destinations safely and on time. While most of our network has recovered to 2019 capacity levels or beyond, our China network has been last to recover. At the start of the quarter, we were operating 4 flights a week from San Francisco to Shanghai. And this month, we increased that to a daily flight.\nNext month, we will be the first U.S. airline to return to Beijing with a daily flight from San Francisco. We believe this measured approach to bringing China capacity back online as appropriate as demand slowly recovers. These increased flights are a significant step forward in rebuilding our Asia Pacific network. Late last month, our pilots ratified their industry-leading agreement. This contract enables us to continue providing great career opportunities in United, and I'm excited for the future as we continue to execute our United X plan. At this point, we ratified agreements for 4 out of our 5 major work groups.\nApplied attendance represented by AFA are in active negotiations, and we look forward to sharing an update when we have one. As a reminder, we began accruing for pilot pay rate increases in the first quarter of this year. Our outlook has and continues to represent our expectation for this agreement. And with that, I will hand it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue environment.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 12.5%. 1 point ahead of our guidance midpoint. PRASM was down 2.8%. PRASM was down 1% and capacity increased 15.7% year-over-year. Capacity came in a bit below our original outlook, mostly due to the changes in our Hawaii client levels in response to the fires. It's nice to come in ahead of our revenue outlook as the strong Q3 outcome further validates that our United next commercial strategies are working well and that we have differentiated United from our competition.\nDemand for the Atlantic and the Pacific was truly outstanding, and we see that trend continuing into the fourth quarter. Third quarter domestic PRASM results were consistent with our year-over-year performance in the second quarter of down 2.1 points. In other words, we saw no real change in our domestic trends in the quarter-over-quarter review. Our focus on prudent gauge growth centered in our hubs resulted in strong positive marginal revenue on our incremental capacity.\nWe did focus a majority of our third quarter growth on international flying. International capacity increased 22%. International PRASM was up 1.3% year-over-year. International profit margins remain well ahead of domestic, though domestic margins remain solidly profitable. We also saw strong performance across most of the globe. Clearly, Europe was a standout with capacity being up 12% and with positive PRASM performance. Asia Pacific led international PRASM up 3.8% on 86% more capacity. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect total revenue to be up approximately 10.5% on approximately 15.5% more capacity.\nThis implies TRASM will be down around 4.5% year-over-year. Our guide assumes we began limited service to Tel Aviv began in November. Tel Aviv accounts for approximately 2% of United's consolidated capacity. As we think about the sequential trend in unit revenues, I know many of you are wondering if we are seeing a slowdown. Resurgence of the Pacific line is resulting in many long-haul flights being added, increasing United's long-haul international stateline by 5 points versus Q3. United's Q4 unit revenue expectations are consistent with Q3 adjusted for stage.\nUnited has taken full advantage of the demand surge across the Pacific with capacity being added to key markets, including the long pending resumption of daily flights to Beijing, and Shanghai from San Francisco and the addition of Manila, just to name a few. Having done capacity plan in my entire career, I have said that our team is the best in the business. United properly allocated our 2023 growth to international markets over domestic and in domestic markets, we wisely invested engaged, not scope or depth. Less than 1% of United's domestic capacity this winter is in new markets, not for in 2019.\nCapacity planning for 2024 will be even more important to achieve our financial goals. While we're not going to provide guidance for 2024 today, we have plans to let the 30% growth we've added to the Atlantic since 2019 mature in 2024. And expect to fly a similar level of capacity in '24 as '23. We also plan on little to no growth for the first half of next year on domestic flying. This preview of our 2024 capacity, I think, will allow United to continue to produce top-tier results as we align with industry conditions. I wanted to touch on a few other important commercial elements today as well.\nRecently, the question I get asked the most often by our frequent flyers is about potential changes to achieve premier status on United. The good news is we have no material changes planned for 2025 program year. We've carefully managed our premier population in recent years to maintain a robust and valuable set of benefits for each premier member. We very much believe and never causing a situation where everyone has a premier status which obviously results in no one receiving an adequate level of premier benefits. Our United strategy to offer Premier members access to more premium seats than each of our competitors is enhancing the value of our pre-compare loyalty program.\nI also wanted to take a moment to talk about revenue segmentation. We've worked really hard on perfecting segmentation of our products in recent years. Not only do we have multiple product types appealing to a broad range of customers but we also have new, more effective ways to distribute our products by united.com and NDC technology. United is, of course, very focused on growing all of our premium products, given where our hubs are located. When I look back at where United was in 2017, we simply didn't offer premium products that many of our best customers were willing to pay for.\nWe put a plan in place with United Next to correct this disconnect in our commercial plans, and we're making quick progress. Premium Plus is one of our best examples of segmentation and has been a huge success. Premium Plus third quarter 2023 capacity is 5x that of 2019, with revenue up 7x 2019 and is now our most profitable cabin. Premium Plus is now offered on all twin engine international aircraft to United and also on board will be onboard our new A321 XLR jets, which replaced our 757 [indiscernible] 2025. Another important driver of revenues has been the success in domestic first class.\nSo we plan on increasing our first class seats per departure from 9 in 2019 to 16 by 2027, an 80% increase. This increase in first-class seats comes as more and more customers are seeking elevated experiences. United's Basic Economy product represents the other side of the spectrum compared to many of our premium products. Basic has made United more competitive versus ultra low-cost competitors and giving our customers more choices. Basic economy is now 12% of our domestic passengers, and we expect to be even more competitive in this segment of the market in the future with the arrival of our large narrow-body jets in 2024 and 2025.\nThese new jets have low marginal CASMs allowing United to be price competitive with anyone at any time. While it took time to perfect the offer and we are only in the early stages of inducting these jets basic has changed the competitive dynamics of our industry. I think it's also becoming increasingly care that United's core business model of multiple product choices and expanding club network, experience levels from basic economy to Polaris provide travelers choices, and for United's grown premium product choice travelers are willing to pay for. Beyond segmentation, United Network split evenly between domestic and global capacity, our leading positions [Technical Difficulty]\n\nKristina Munoz\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nI'll use for that brief interruption. Can we continue, silos?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for standing by. We are now live again to the audience.\n\nKristina Munoz\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYou can go.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nDiversified revenue streams provide United with a resiliency other business models will just not ever achieve. RASM-accretive gauge growth focused in our hubs in turn provides United with the unmatched ability to create cost convergence for years to come with our low-cost providers. Thanks again to the best team in the business. And with that, I will hand it off to Mike.\n\nMichael D. Leskinen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew. And good morning, everyone. Before I get into the results, I want to take a minute to say how honored and excited I am to join the United executive team during such a transformative time. Industry dynamics are constantly changing, and I continue to see the incredible opportunity ahead for United. We believe our no excuses mentality and clear strategy with United Next or laying the foundation for success. I look forward to continuing the conversations I've had with the investment community thus far in my new role, and I'm excited to lead the talented finance team here at United.\nNow let's turn to the results. For the third quarter, we delivered pretax earnings of $1.6 billion and a pretax margin of 10.8%. Our earnings per share of $3.65 was ahead of expectations as our revenue growth came at a full point ahead of our guidance midpoint. Thanks to the amazing commercial team for their great work. They truly are the best in the business. Fuel remains volatile and worked against us in the quarter. Our average fuel price for the quarter ended $0.30 higher than the midpoint of our July expectation and more than accounts for the entirety of the reduced outlook for the third quarter.\nOur CASM-ex remained on track at up 2.6% versus the third quarter of 2022. Our operation to Tel Aviv has been impacted by the recent events in the region and is materially impacting our outlook as this market represents approximately 2% of our capacity. For the fourth quarter, we expect CASM-ex to be up approximately 3.5%, with capacity up 15.5%, both versus the fourth quarter of last year. Our guidance incorporates no service to televise through the end of October. If flights are further suspended through the end of the year, it would reduce capacity by an additional approximately 1.5 points and add approximately 1.5 points of CASM-ex as it's very difficult to cut the associated expenses related to this flying so close in.\nThese changes bring capacity for the full year, up around 17.5% year-over-year just below our guidance. We're proud of that result given all the headwinds United and our industry faced a huge testament to the hard work of our operations team. Lower capacity along with elevated maintenance expense has pressured CASM-ex and pushed us above the high end of our CASM-ex range for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share of approximately $1.80 with an average fuel price of approximately $3.28. Absent our Tel Aviv flying through the rest of the year, our fourth quarter earnings per share would be reduced by approximately $0.30.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we feel good about the core fundamentals of our expenses. However, we are facing sizable headwinds with labor and expectation of a new flight attendant agreement and continued higher maintenance expense. We believe our capacity growth, along with improvements in utilization are helpful tailwinds as we manage down expenses. We are working through our 2024 budget and new projections for 2024 capacity, CASM-ex and our other financials, and we'll provide our customary guidance on our January call.\nOn the fleet, in the third quarter, we took delivery of 18 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and pay for 14 of those aircraft with cash. We expect to take delivery of 2737 MAX aircraft in the fourth quarter, and we took delivery of our first Airbus A321neo last week. This is a reduction of 12 aircraft versus our plan in July for the second half of the year. Due to these aircraft shifting into 2024, we now expect our full year 2023 adjusted capital expenditures to be approximately $8 billion. Earlier this month, we announced our [indiscernible] and exercised options for 50787 for delivery in 2028 and beyond. Managing the delivery skyline for the future of United is critical. This order builds on the successes we already seen with United Next and reflects our confidence as we extend our planning into the next decade.\nWith the retirement of our Boeing 757 and 767 fleet later this decade, these aircraft are important additions as we work towards fleet simplification and capitalize on our cost reduction opportunity. Turning briefly to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with almost $19 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Before we end our prepared remarks today, it's important to recognize that while our financial results remain strong, as an industry, we are facing new and unique challenges. Our growth has helped us deliver strong relative cost performance, and that's even before we begin the accelerated gauge growth that we expect will come from the 737 MAX 10 and the A321 additions to our fleet.\nWe are committed to continuing to deliver industry-leading cost performance. And this will form the foundation for continued cost convergence and improving absolute profitability. And because our growth is focused on our hubs, we're also growing with industry-leading PRASM. There are and will always be headwinds facing our industry. But as we enter 2024, United has great momentum, and I'm confident a very bright future. With that, I'll hand it over to Kristina to start the Q&A."

Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristina, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before I discuss our financial performance for the second quarter, I'd like to first address the operational challenges at Newark at the end of last month. I am extremely proud of the people of United for all they did to recover under very challenging circumstances. Our pilots, flight attendant agents, contact center teams and others went above and beyond to inform and assist our customers in an extremely stressful situation. We're now doing more than ever to mitigate the impact of weather, congestion and other infrastructure constraints at Newark and frankly, to build a schedule at Newark that's more manageable given the frequency of weather events and the variable operating constraints that exist there, even on Blue Sky days.\nBrett will highlight just a few of those changes shortly, but we've already put them in motion already starting to improve the working experience for our people and travel experience for our customers.\nA bigger picture. This quarter was yet another proof point that our United next strategy was correct and is working almost exactly as we expected. Over the past couple of years, I've talked a lot about 3 [ exodus ] constraints based in the industry, but also the fact that very constraints and challenges are going to set the table for improved financial results for the airline industry; one, pilot shortages; two, supply chain disruptions; and three, infrastructure limitations. At United, we have control over the first 2 constraints had the supply chain, and we mostly got ahead of the curve and had minimal issues there. But we're probably as exposed or the most exposed to the infrastructure constraint since our hubs are in some of the largest and most crowded airports in the country.\nSo now we're taking even more action to give us the ability to operate more reliably despite the infrastructure constraints. That means we've had a lower capacity plans for the second half and therefore, raised our CASM-ex guidance. But the reality is that our CASM-ex will be better than it otherwise would have been because there's nothing expense that was running an off-schedule operations and these changes are designed to get our operations, particularly at Newark, working at a level that reflects the fact that it only has one set of parallel runway operating in the most crowded airspace in the world.\nThe flip side of this coin, however, is that these exogenous constraints were also the basis of our United Next strategy, and it is off to an incredible even representing [ start ].\nThis was an all-time record quarter for pretax earnings and EPS on an adjusted basis. This performance reflects our success in building a strategy to, one, aggressively hire pilots; two, grow our Mid-Con hubs; three, upgauge our domestic fleet and four, expand our wide-body fleet and international exposure in response to the trends that we identified at the beginning of COVID.\nImportantly, we now expect to deliver earnings per share of $11 to $12, even with incremental conservatism in our cost in the back half of the year. The vision and strategic outlook that we first identified nearly 3 years ago is happening. Cost convergence is happening, which has changed our business dramatically on the domestic front. Long term, positive structural changes to the international markets are also apparent in our results. We continue to anticipate that the GDP relationship between airline revenues has been reset higher due to cost conversions and will continue to improve.\nThe outlook for United and our United Next strategy is incredibly bright, as highlighted by our financial results this quarter. This quarter demonstrates that we're ahead of our planned targets and the challenges to emphasize that the industry backdrop gives us a clear path to our 14% pretax margin in 2026.\nAs we march towards that goal, we're focused on setting the airline up for success. I'm also pleased that we've reached an agreement on an industry-leading contract with Alpha. The 4-year agreement once ratified to deliver a meaningful pay raise and quality of life improvements for our pilots. Thanks to the team for getting this across the finish line. We are well on our way to being the best airline in the history of aviation. United Next gave us an unbeatable head start on as long as we execute and execute we will.\nThanks again to the United team. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott. Thank you to our United team for their hard work this quarter. As Scott mentioned, during the last week of June, we experienced one of the most challenging operational environment in United's history, impacting primarily our largest international departure hub, Newark. Our hub locations make us disproportionately prone to weather and then the second quarter, weather was particularly challenging.\nWith 25 major irregular operation days accounted for 75% of our second quarter cancellations. Despite this, we are focused on setting United up for success, and being able to recover more quickly in the future.\nWe are [indiscernible] a few new initiatives in Newark that will improve our operation.\nFirst, we are reducing the total flying in the peak hours to align better with the capabilities of today's constrained operating environment.\nSecond, we expect to have additional gating as we bring the remaining 6 Gates in Terminal A online, 2 of which are additional wide-body gates as well as make additional tactical changes at United.\nThird, we are adjusting our schedules to increase our out-and-back flying to limit the downline system impact of any cancellations or delays.\nFourth, we are increasing our resources and crew scheduling and accelerating the time line our technology enhancements and automation.\nLastly and importantly, our partnerships with the FAA and Port Authority are essential to the airline's success. Collaboration and communication amongst these groups has never been stronger.\nTo that end, Scott and our government affairs team continue to remain actively engaged in working with the administration and leaders in Congress pass an FAA reauthorization bill. Legislation that equips the FAA with the resources, tools and funding they need isn't just essential to the success of our industry. It's among the best investments that we could make for the traveling public and the U.S. economy right now. And we're committed to continuing to advocate for a smart FAA reauthorization billing and to get it passed quickly.\nThese are only a few of the initiatives underway, but combined with lower capacity, these adjustments and approximately 1 to 2 points of incremental year-over-year pressure toward 2023 CASM-ex.\nGerry will go into more detail, but running a successful and efficient airline is critical and United is laser-focused on getting our customers to their destinations safely and on time.\nAs we work to respond to these challenges, we are also investing in our customer experience. Recently, we announced new mobile app features that support our customers during travel disruptions. These first-of-their-kind tools will allow customers to rebook track their bags and get me and hotel vouchers when eligible on their personal device.\nIt is important for us to provide our customers the resources they need for flight or their flight at their fingertips, especially when things don't go as planned. As Scott mentioned, over the win, we reached a tentative agreement with our pilots represented by Alpha. We're thankful for the hard work our pilots put in every day, and this agreement is a representation of that. We are still in active negotiations with our flight attendants represented by the AFA, and have new agreements in place for all other work groups.\nThe United team continues to be resilient. We're making real-time changes that directly impact the travel experience for our customers and for our employees day to day. Proud to be a member of this team. I want to thank everyone for their unwavering work.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue [ gap ].\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. I'd like to start off today by thanking the entire United team for their hard work and dedication and taking care of our customers, particularly during the final week [indiscernible]. Our financial results provide proof that our United plans are working and that the demand environment remains robust. United finished the second quarter with top line record quarterly revenues of $14.2 million. Total revenues in the quarter were up 17%, ahead of our guidance of 14% to 16%.\nJune was exceptionally strong and was our best revenue month ever. Since the start of June, we've had 13 of our 16 highest loan gross revenue days. TRASM in the quarter was down 0.4% and PRASM was up 2.2% with capacity up 17.5%.\nInternational results were exceptionally strong with passenger revenues up 44% year-over-year. International PRASM increased 13.3% year-over-year. Year-over-year PRASM results were strongest in the Pacific followed by the Atlantic and then Latin America. The resurgence of the United Pacific entity has been the most transformative Margins for our global [indiscernible], continued to outpace domestic margins.\nSecond quarter capacity deployment plans, lean and international flying with 27% more capacity year-over-year which proved advantageous. International ASMs represent 45.4% of United's 2Q capacity, up 2 points from 2019.\nDomestic passenger revenues were up 7.8% on 10.5% more capacity year-over-year, largely in line with our expectations at the start of the quarter. Domestic PRASM was down 2.4%, but that was a fantastic outcome as it compares to an exceptionally strong Q2 of '22. We expect similar or slightly better results for domestic PRASM in the third quarter.\nOur RM setup for the quarter proved to be the right one. We held back seats early in the booking curve, saving them for higher yields and closing bookings, and we ended the quarter with record top line results.\nThe business recovery remained stable. Revenue from international travelers line for business grew 40% year-over-year, with 10% growth in the -- on domestic business travelers. On a ticketed basis, business travel revenue continues to trend roughly flat to 2019.\nCargo revenues have normalized post pandemic. Yields were down 38% versus 2022, but do remain up 29% versus '19. We expect yields in the third quarter to be consistent with Q2. Healthy Cargo revenues and yields are helping drive incremental profitability to our global long-haul flying.\nMileagePlus had another strong quarter with revenue up 11% year-over-year we broke records this quarter for all key measurements from new card acquisitions to new member enrollment. Ancillary revenue from bags and seats hit a record $1 billion in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Per passenger ancillary revenue increased 8% to $23.79.\nReplacement of single class RJs with mainline aircraft with multiple types of seat upgrade opportunities is a key driver of our revenue growth. Premium leisure demand remains very strong across the board. Our domestic first class capacity is up 4% from 2019, but RASM growth in that cabin is 12 points stronger than the main cabin even with corporate traffic not fully recovered.\nOur global long-haul Polaris product is also offsetting the loss of corporate business revenue with premium leisure demand and validates the size of our Polaris Cabin post-pandemic or correct for United hubs.\nFor Q3, we expect the total revenue to be up 10% to 13% year-over-year with capacity up approximately 16%. The demand environment remains strong, and September and October looked particularly strong relative to both 2019 and July and August. Another sign that seasonality has changed in the summer peak period is more spread out relative to the past.\nOnce again, Q3 capacity deployment focuses on international markets with capacity expected to be up 23% versus 13% for domestic. We believe international revenue will continue to outperform domestic revenue in the third quarter across the globe other than Latin America. Overall, our domestic margins are now back to 2019 levels while our international margins are trending well above where they were in '19.\nEarlier this week, we announced an expansion of our Pacific line this fall with new [indiscernible] from Manila to San Francisco. We also announced a second daily plate from San Francisco to Taipei, a new daily nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong and will resume our service between Los Angeles and Nerita as planned. These additions to our key Pacific destinations are in addition to our previously announced expansion plan to the South Pacific.\nAll international volume remains our focus. We also have plans to improve domestic margins by rebuilding and enhancing connectivity versus 2019, grow and engage faster than any other [indiscernible] and the same focus on our existing subs.\nDomestic connectivity fell materially in the pandemic because we decided to retire about 300 regional jets. But our connectivity is growing every month as we take United next deliveries, and that will continue to drive PRASM higher each month. Like the period from 2017 to 2019 when we grew [ RASM ] and margins by growing connectivity, we'll do it once again but this time with large mainland jets preferred by our customers.\n[indiscernible] has also been a key gap and opportunity for United larger gate narrow-bodies with 190 or more seats operate with the best single [ line ] margins in North America.\nThe introduction of the A321 in MAX 10 were always a key enabler of our United mix age growth and margin growth. The potential of these larger jets is proven and further upside to United Airlines when we finally enter the fleet.\nI also want to add to Scott and Brent's comments about Newark and our United Next plans. United Next always contemplated that the only way to grow Newark was upgauging from regional to mainline line. We expected that to lead to higher growth in to ASM at Newark even though the total number of flights would not be growing.\nOur growth in Newark has always been contingent upon larger aircraft, not more aircraft. While we need to cut departure -- well, may need a couple targets more than planned. We don't believe these changes will impact our long-term capacity from Newark due to the use of larger gauge aircraft.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Gerry to talk about our financial results. Gerry?\n\nGerald Laderman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that for the second quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly pretax earnings in the United history of $2.2 billion. Our earnings per share of $0.53 was also an all-time record. And in addition, we produced a record second quarter pretax margin of 15.3%, 3 points higher than second quarter of 2019 and ahead of our expectations. This exceptional performance was driven by stronger-than-expected revenue and lower-than-expected fuel prices.\nThe severe weather at the end of June, which drove multiple consecutive days of strained operations, did lead to a 1 point reduction in capacity for the quarter. We also incurred incremental disruption related costs that weren't anticipated at the time of our guidance. The capacity loss and added costs led to a CASM-ex impact of approximately 1.5 points for the quarter.\nExcluding this impact, until June 24, we were trending below the midpoint of our CASM-ex range for the quarter. An indication that our core costs remain under control. And for the rest of the year, the operational and scheduling changes that Brett discussed have reduced our full year capacity plans from our prior expectations, and we now expect full year capacity to be up approximately 18% versus 2022.\nAdditionally, our CASM-ex guidance now incorporates an expectation of additional incremental costs in order to address the operational challenges. Specifically, for the third quarter, we expect CASM-ex to be up 2% to 3% with capacity up approximately 16%, both versus the third quarter of last year. When combined with our results for the second quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate our 4-year CASM-ex to be up approximately 1% to 2% versus last year.\nHowever, just like the second quarter, outside of the revisions I discussed, our core costs for the rest of the year are trending as expected.\nFurthermore, our CASM-ex expectation for the year continues to include the impact of our recently announced agreement with our pilots.\nTurning to earnings. The strong revenue environment and moderate fuel prices continue to provide strength to our bottom line. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be $3.85 to $4.35, with a fuel price of $2.50 to $2.80. More importantly, given our second quarter performance and third quarter outlook, we are raising our full year earnings per share expectation to the top half of our previous guidance range of $10 to $12.\nOn fleet, we took delivery of 20 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the second quarter and paid for 10 of those aircraft with cash. We expect to take delivery of 28737 MAX aircraft in the third quarter and also look forward to our first Airbus A321neo later this fall. We continue to expect our full year adjusted capital expenditures to be approximately $8.5 billion.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $21 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. We are comfortable with our current level of liquidity, particularly given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. In the second quarter, we opportunistically issued $1.3 billion of enhanced equipment trust certificates secured by a pool of recently delivered Boeing MAX aircraft with an interest rate of $0.05 which was attractive in the current interest rate environment.\nAdditionally, we prepaid $1 billion of floating rate debt, which carried a current coupon of over 9%. Our adjusted net debt is now down almost $3 billion since the end of 2022 and $6 billion since the end of 2021. With the reduction in debt and the improvement in earnings, at the end of the second quarter, our trailing 12-month adjusted net debt-to-EBITDAR ratio improved by a full turn to 2.4x versus the end of the first quarter.\nPutting us back to where we were prior to the pandemic and ahead of pace to achieve our target of less than 3x by the end of 2023. We also continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow for the full year, including the impact of our new pilot agreements.\nIn conclusion, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing and believe we're adequately mitigated against additional operational risk in the back half of the year. I'm extremely proud of the United team for delivering our strong financial results.\nSix months ago, when we first announced our full year EPS guidance, we were met with skepticism from some of you listening. Now more than halfway through the year, as we increase our EPS guidance, I hope all of you are as comfortable as we are with the value of the United Next plan, where we continue to march toward meeting our long-term targets and delivering for our customers, employees and shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Kristina to start the Q&A."

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with Q&A.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nPresident, American Airlines, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the entire United team for delivering exceptional operation this quarter, given our hub geography. United almost all -- has the most flights impacted by weather, air traffic control delays of any U.S. airline. But despite this in Q1, we had the lowest mainline flight and seat cancellation rates of any airline in the country. That's important, not just for the obvious customer and brand impact, but it's also the key to hitting our planned capacity and CASM-ex target. I'm going to leave the detailed quarterly results and guidance to Gerry and Andrew. But today, I'll take a few minutes to talk about 4 emerging themes that have come to the foreground and I think are important to the United investment case.\nOne, there appears to be a clear change in seasonality that is causing peak leisure demand months, March through October to be even stronger, while months that were historically reliant on business demand are weaker, that particularly impacts January, February and the first half of November and December. We believe demand is just structurally different than it was pre-pandemic, and we're still figuring out that new normal.\nSecond, as we've expected all along, long-haul international is moving into the lead over domestic. Andrew will give more details, but this is a multiyear structural change based on aircraft retirements and pilot downgrades at essentially all long-haul U.S. airlines around the world, except United.\nBut my third theme is an appropriately cautionary point. Our guidance and everything we're discussing today is our base case scenario based on what we're seeing right now. And what we're seeing right now is still strong demand. At airlines, the macroeconomic weakness is being offset with the countertrend of consumer spending continuing to rebalance back to services. And by the way, we still remain below our historical GDP relationship, arguably indicating more room to run on the revenue recovery.\nHowever, it seems clear that the macro risks are higher today than they were even a few months ago as demonstrated by the banking scare with Silicon Valley Bank. We saw an immediate drop in close-in business demand that lasted for about 2 weeks, but now appears to have recovered. Our base case, therefore, remains a mild recession or soft landing, which is consistent with what we're currently seeing in our bookings. But we agree that the tail risk is higher than normal. While we feel good about our $10 to $12 full year EPS, if the economy softens further, we've prepared for it by, a, having a lot of flexibility in the business on capacity of needed; b, improving our balance sheet to withstand the near-term issue with approximately $19 billion in liquidity and having reduced our total debt, including pension by $4.6 billion over the past 12 months; and c, it's actually my fourth theme, which is controlling what we can and hitting our CASM-ex target in this new, different and more challenging operating environment.\nWe can't control what happens with the macro economy, but we can and are doing a great job of controlling our costs. You can't run your airline like it's 2019. It's different and harder now. Cancellation rates are the leading indicator of forward capacity and therefore, CASM-ex, and United is leading the way on this front. Gerry will discuss some of the year-over-year tailwinds that will drive lower CASM-ex in the back half of this year, but we only need CASM-ex to be approximately 1 point better in the second half of the year to hit our full year target. We remain solidly on track.\nTo wrap up over the last 3 years, our industry is confronted a rapidly changing environment. United hasn't been perfect, but we've got a lot more right than wrong. And on the big picture, we've gotten it right and took the steps in the last 3 years to thrive in exactly this environment. International is stronger. The operating environment is more challenging, which means reliability is harder, but also at a premium for producing bottom line results and we have confidence that our gauge growth and execution are keeping United uniquely on track for our near- and long-term CASM-ex trajectory. That's not to say that there aren't real near-term risks because we all know there are. But we feel really good about the strategic setup and tactical execution here at United.\nI want to again thank the entire United team for their hard work this quarter. We have a busy summer season ahead forward to achieving even more operational and financial records.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott, and thank you to our United team for their hard work this quarter. As Scott mentioned, we continue to see the benefits of running a strong operation.\nIn the first quarter, United led the industry with the lowest seat cancellation rate despite around 20% of our flights being impacted by weather, the most of any of our competitors. This was the first time since 2012 that we led on this metric. Additionally, United was first or second in the quarter for on-time departures at nearly all of our hub locations, including those heavily impacted by winter weather like O'Hare and Denver. Our airline is built to run well and recover fast, and we expect our operation to reflect that through the peak summer season.\nWe continue to navigate the challenges in the current operating environment. Specifically, a constrained industry infrastructure. United is working with the U.S. Department of Transportation and FAA regarding operational disruptions and air traffic staffing challenges. The FAA's decision to consider commercial air traffic with managing the growing number of space launches, combined with the FAA's recent move to give carriers more flexibility and how we all fly in and out of New York area airports shows that the FAA is listening to feedback and finding ways we can all work together.\nIn March, we took steps to reduce our schedule in the New York region and DCA by around 30 daily departures over the summer period to provide the airspace relief requested by the FAA. The schedule reductions are largely regional jet focused and will be redeployed at our other hubs, minimizing the capacity impact to the system. It is our hope that this will drive improved customer experience, offline United in the New York area and throughout our network.\nWe're excited to announce that we reached a tentative agreement with our nearly 30,000 employees represented by the International Association of Machinists, with voting on the agreement expected to be completed by May 1. We are very proud of the work that our team does daily to support our operation and create a positive travel experience for our customers.\nRegarding other labor agreements, a new contract with our technicians represented by the IBT who gratified in January, and we are still in active negotiations with our flight attendants represented by the AFA and our pilots represented by ALPA. As a reminder, we reached an agreement with our dispatchers represented by PAFCA last year. We look forward to sharing further updates in the future.\nI once again want to thank our team for being the best in the industry. We remain confident in our outlook as we leverage our industry-leading operational performance and network advantages.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue environment.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nSenior Vice President – Network Planning, Alliances & Sales, US Airways, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. First quarter top line revenues of $11.4 billion finished consistent with our updated guidance of up 51% versus 2022. TRASM was up 22.5% year-over-year. While we were below our initial guidance, we expect that our TRASM performance in the first quarter will be top tier.\nAs expected, other revenues in the quarter, while strong, are growing at a slower rate than passenger revenues, the opposite trend we saw last year and over the course of the pandemic. While Cargo revenue declined 37% year-over-year, it remains 39% above the same period in 2019.\nMileagePlus other revenue had yet another strong quarter and was up 25% year-over-year, driven by our strategic partnership with Chase. United Credit Card continued to set records in Q1, including the highest first quarter ever for [ card spend ], new accounts up over 30% year-over-year and account attrition near historic lows. We also welcome Richard Nunn to the United team as the new CEO of MileagePlus.\nAs Scott indicated, we believe we're seeing different revenue seasonality for the United Network post-pandemic, and that change to impact our relative margin in Q1. New seasonality positively impacted March through October 2022, where new remote work schedule simulated business, particularly premium leisure. Ultimately, if these trends continue, we expect to be able to operate a more consistent level of capacity between March and October and future years. However, we believe the new seasonality negatively impacted Q1 in January or February, along with the first halves in November and December. With United's relatively small presence in the Caribbean and Florida where demand is usually strong in Q1 and over the winter months, the United network is more reliant on business traffic that has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic volumes in these periods.\nUnited's global network and East West strengths are simply better aligned to March through October, post pandemic where leisure and premium leisure business compensate for less traditional business traffic.\nAs we head into Q2 2023, we are tracking ahead of 2022 and all the ways that we measure business traffic, a really good sign for revenue momentum. While it's still early on, we do see corporate business from May and June tracking well ahead of the previous Months at this time. The business traffic rebound we're seeing is strongest in global long-haul markets, where a video conference is not a substitute for an in-person meeting. The recent bank and scare did initiate a slowdown in demand across multiple customer types in the quarter. Impact on business demand for domestic flying was the most significant, impact on domestic leisure was smaller, an impact on overall international demand was actually minimal. In the weeks after the scare, we saw business demand relative to the same period of 2019 declined by 8 points after steady progress experienced to the quarter to that point. This trend has since reversed back to pre-bank and scare levels.\nIn Q2, we expect total revenue to be up 14% to 16% versus the second quarter of 2022, with capacity up approximately 18.5%. Our expectation to our revenue in the second quarter continued to show strength with approximately 8% to 10% growth in domestic revenues and almost 30% for International.\nSecond quarter bookings and revenues do look good versus the same point in 2022, with booked yields up 13% and 31% above 2019, respectively. For 2023, we expect to expand international flying by approximately twice the rate of domestic leaning into the favorable supply-demand balance that we expect. We'll be focused on extending United's leading position across the Atlantic and the Asia and the South Pacific. We believe this capacity deployment plan will set us up to meet our financial objectives given the stronger revenue outlook we are seeing for international flying and the rebound in Polaris cabin.\nWe'll also pass 2 critical milestones by this summer with all United international wide-body jets having the latest generation Polaris seat and a premium plus cabin. While further return to corporate business will help profitability in all quarters, we're not assuming that will occur in our 2023 revenue outlook.\nUnited scheduled capacity this summer is up 39% in the Atlantic but industry capacity, excluding United, is estimated to be down about 1%. United will operate an average of 207 daily flights across the Atlantic this summer. Across the Pacific, United plans to be up 14%, excluding China, with industry capacity down about 7%, both versus 2019. Overall, international ASMs will be 46% of United's capacity this summer versus 43% in 2019.\nYesterday, we announced another set of capacity increases to the South Pacific ideally timed for the Southern summer later this year. These include the first-ever non-stop service from San Francisco to Christchurch, a new service from Los Angeles to Auckland in partnership with Air New Zealand, and to Los Angeles to Brisbane, where we'll connect to our new partner, Virgin Australia.\nRebuilding connectivity back to our original 2019 standards in our Mid-Con hubs and Dallas will also be a long-term focus for our domestic line. The loss of regional jets turn the pandemic without mainline jets to backfill them cause connectivity to suffer. Peak bank sizes at our high flow hubs are down 10% to 20% versus 2019.\nWe were able to build connectivity and margins in 2018 and 2019 when we increase bank size connectivity, and we expect to execute a similar strategy in 2023 and 2024. However, this time around, we'll do it with the appropriately sized 737 jets instead of single-class regional jets. As requested by the FAA, we've reduced our planned flights from New York City this summer, including to and from Newark. We believe this will be the first time in years that Newark will operate within the airport's capacity abilities in most hours and consistent with the slot allocations. We're optimistic that between the new terminals and capacity consistent with the runway's capabilities, the customer experience will improve dramatically, and we appreciate the partnership with the FAA to make this happen.\nUnited will gain up to 17 new mainline gates in Terminal A and Newark this summer versus 2022, which will improve Newark's reliability and customer experience. Along with the new Newark gates, we will open a new United Club in Terminal A and in Terminal C later this year, adding 38,000 square feet and will be up 161% in club space relative to 2019.\nAs impressive as that club space measurement is in Newark, our club members in Denver will experience an opening of 3 United Clubs over the next year that include a total of 97,000 square feet, a 149% increase versus 2019. Construction of our new gates in Denver is also almost complete and will have 90 gates up from 66, we had in 2019, which we expect will allow us to dramatically increase bank sizes and connectivity in 2024 and 2025.\nAt United, we remain focused on our high ground, structural strengths focused on global long haul, correcting connectivity issues in our Mid-Con hubs that surface during the pandemic and, of course, gauge, increases that are consistent with our large hub markets. Our capacity plan for this year remains in place without adjustment as we operate with strong operational results.\nWith that, I wanted to say thanks to the entire United team, and I'll turn it over to Gerry.\n\nGerald Laderman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning to everyone.\nLet's start with our first quarter results. Our pre-tax loss of $256 million was in line with expectations and at the better end of our updated guidance issued last month. We saw losses in January and February due to seasonal weakness, but March turned solidly profitable. Our first quarter fuel price of $3.33 came in at the lower end of our revised guidance range. This was still about $0.14 higher than our expectation at the start of the quarter due to a spike in jet fuel prices in late January and early February.\nTurning to nonfuel costs. Our first quarter CASM-ex came in slightly better than our revised guidance range at down 0.1% versus the first quarter last year. Our operational performance in the first quarter was truly exceptional, and our CASM-ex fee is largely due to the cost benefit of a reliable operation.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $19 billion in liquidity. We continue to leverage the flexibility provided by our cash with financing opportunities and paying down debt. We generated over $3 billion in operating cash flow in the first quarter, the highest for any quarter in United's history, and we produced free cash flow of over $1 billion. Over the last 12 months, our total debt, including pension liability, has declined by approximately $4.6 billion, and we remain on track to meet our 2023 target of adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDAR of less than 3x.\nLooking ahead, we expect second quarter CASM-ex to be flat to up 2%, with capacity up approximately 18.5% both versus the second quarter of last year. Strong cost performance underpins our confidence in the earnings trajectory of the business in the second quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.50 to $4, with a fuel price of $2.80 to $3. As noted in our investor update, this fuel price is based on prices as of April 12.\nAs others mentioned, our strong operational performance in the first quarter sets the tone for the remainder of the year, and is key to our conviction in achieving our CASM-ex targets. For the full year, we continue to be on track to keep CASM-ex approximately flat versus 2022 with nonfuel unit costs in the second half of this year declining versus the second half of last year. To give context as to why we expect CASM-ex in the second half of this year to improve on a year-over-year basis versus the first half of this year, it's helpful to consider the 2022 cost baseline.\nWith COVID still significantly impacting the business in the first half of last year, we have certain unique headwinds in the first half of this year when comparing costs on a year-over-year basis. There are 2 notable examples. Revenue in the first half of 2022 was much lower than the second half of 2022, which meant that distribution costs were also much lower in the first half of last year versus the second half. This drives the year-over-year comparisons for the first half of this year to be commensurately higher than the second half of this year. A similar phenomenon exists with maintenance expense. As Omicron abated and the recovery took hold, we ramped up our maintenance activity in the back half of '22 to more normalized levels. Again, the difference in year-over-year costs are much more muted in the second half of this year versus the first half.\nSo simply put, the 2 items represent a 1- to 2-point CASM-ex headwind in the first half of this year, which won't exist in the second half. These drivers, along with strategic cost management, gauge growth and running a reliable operation support our expectation that we will hit our flat CASM-ex target for the year. When combined with our revenue outlook, we remain confident in our trajectory towards $10 to $12 in adjusted diluted EPS for the full year, whether we face a mild recession or soft landing.\nAs we have left the starting gate for our United Next plan, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made not only financially but in our operation and across the entire organization. While we continue to live in uncertain times. I know that we will successfully manage everything under our control as we continue on a path to reach our full year financial objectives.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Kristina for the Q&A.\n\nKristina Munoz\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Gerry. We will now take questions from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions]\nCylus, please describe the procedure to ask a question."

Scott Kirby\n\nCEO & Director, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThere was a question about whether you can hear us. Hopefully, everyone can. Well, thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. Before we do our normal -- I'll walk you through a short deck that explains the intellectual rationale about what we're doing -- and where we think the industry is headed over a longer-term run. In short, we think there's ample evidence that there really have been structural changes in the airline industry that set the entire industry up for higher margins than we had pre-pandemic.\nFirst, while the specifics of the demand environment will be different, we expect it to return to at least 2019 level -- think it could go higher. Second, we believe cost convergence among all airlines as well as supply challenges may drive structurally higher industry margins. And finally, United has been pretty accurate about the macro outlooks, impact of COVID and what the recovery would look like going all the way back to February 29, 2020. And based on that, United really did take a different and unique approach to the recovery.\nAt the onset of the pandemic, we acted first and we acted more aggressively than anyone else to protect our airline and the jobs of the people who work at United. At the time, in fact, some said that we were overreacting that the pandemic wouldn't be so bad. But by confronting that reality and acting quickly, our leadership team was able to be the first airline to move forward, turning crisis into opportunity and begin making plans for big investments in United's futures, while others, frankly, were still in crisis response mode.\nIt clearly had a head start on planning for the recovery and you're already seeing it in both our absolute results as we've achieved our 9.1% adjusted pre-tax margin ahead of schedule and in our relative margin results compared to the rest of the industry.\nOn this next slide, you can see what industry revenue has looked like as a percentage of GDP, overtime. A few interesting points. The industry still has about 15% domestic revenue growth left to go just to get back to 2019 levels here in 2023. Our base case, 9% and 14% margin target assume that we just get back to the 0.49% ratio. In the 1990s and 2000s, however, revenue to GDP was even higher. As you'll see in the next few slides, we think that cost convergence may drive revenues higher than 0.49% and for what it's worth, every single basis point of domestic increase translates into about 1 point of margin for United.\nOn Slide 5 and 6, I'll address what I think is the most significant structural change to happen to the industry in a long time for a host of reasons. We believe the industry capacity aspirations for 2023 and beyond are simply unachievable. That's just like 2022, when the industry capacity was 7 points lower than initial guidance, and we believe the same thing will happen this year for the same reasons.\nWe've talked a lot about the pilot shortage, which is just one of multiple constraints. We, along with Delta, American and Southwest alone, are planning to hire about 8,000 pilots this year compared to historical supply in the 6,000 to 7,000 range. Pilots are and will remain a significant constraint on capacity.\nPost-COVID, all companies, including airlines and the FAA, need to staff at higher levels. Lower experience levels combined with sick rates that are elevated because of COVID and new state legislation that makes it a lot easier to call in sick. We believe in the airline that tries to run at the same stepping levels that it had pre-pandemic is bound to fail and likely to tip over to melt down any time there are weather or air traffic control stresses in the system. OEMs are behind on aircraft, on engines, on parts. Across the board, there are supply chain constraints that limit the ability of airlines to grow.\nFinally, the FAA and most airlines with the exception of the network carriers have outgrown their technology infrastructure and simply cannot operate reliably in this more challenging environment. Taking all of the above into the consideration. We think, at United, we need to carry at least 5% more pilots per block hour than pre-pandemic. And in addition to that, air traffic control challenges mean our taxi and in-route flight times are elevated and growing.\nSo the same number of block hours probably produces 4% to 5% fewer ASMs. Put it together, we need 10% more pilots and 5% more aircraft to produce the same number of pre-pandemic ASMs. Like it or not, that's just the new reality and the new math for all airlines. I think, however, we may be the only airline that actually figured this out and likely the only airline that has included this in our 2023 CASM-ex guidance already. And to be clear, all of these issues also impact United.\nThe reality is that the airline industry is probably the most complex operational industry with 5 bars, the highest safety and regulatory standards of any industry in the country and COVID hit our industry harder than others, all of us, airlines and the FAA lost experienced employes and most didn't invest in the future. That means the system simply can't handle the volume today, much less than anticipated growth.\nAt United, we also missed our capacity target for 2022. We had our own challenges over a year ago during Christmas of '21, Omicron hit us all hard, but it also shown a spotlight on other strains in the system. We responded by proactively pulling down capacity. It was the only choice. You can't change the engines on an airplane when it's flying. We flew a lot less last year than we'd have liked to fly, but we did it intentionally because it gave us the breathing room to make even further investments in our technology and infrastructure and to increase our staffing levels.\nAnd we had a huge head start compared to most airlines because we started with much better technology and infrastructure. But also importantly, we got to acceptance quickly and didn't spend much time in denial about the structural changes. We accepted that the structural changes were real and moved quickly to what to do about it. On that point, I also fully recognize that most or perhaps all of our competitors, will get on their calls next week and tell you onetime event, no big deal, no change to our capacity plans. If so, I think they're just wrong. It's intellectually hard. It takes time to get through the denial phase.\nWhat happened over the holidays wasn't a onetime event caused by the weather, and it wasn't just at one airline. One airline got the bulk of the media coverage, but the weather was the straw that broke the camel's back for several this keeps happening over and over again. And you can see that despite good weather, ULCC still hadn't recovered even as we entered the new year. The operational difficulties are just the latest among numerous data points proving the systemic challenges that are going to limit the growth in flights.\nAs you can see on the data on Slide 6, United's hub locations mean that we pretty much always have the worst weather. In spite of this, we're able to lead the industry because we're doing a lot of things differently than we did historically. We made significant additional investments in technology and infrastructure. We're running with 5% to 10% staffing buffers. That means we need more pilots, data agents, rampers et cetera, to fly the same schedule.\nWe're running at about 25% more spare aircraft than we did pre-pandemic, and we're flying lower aircraft utilization. All of those obviously cost money, but it's clearly the right thing to do for our customers and the most -- among the most things we can do to win their loyalty. And it's turning out these buffers are much less expensive than the cost of avoiding the otherwise inevitable operational meltdowns. And their forward guidance, other airlines are likely to talk about returning to 2019 utilization efficiency, et cetera.\nBut we believe that just wrong. Our industry has been changed profoundly by the pandemic and you can't run your airline like it's 2019 or you will fail. But don't take my word for it, watch the data. United will always have the toughest operating environment. Any airline that's operating meaningfully worse than United is out over their skis and has simply outgrown their technology, infrastructure and resources.\nSlide 7 transitions to the unique setup on the international front. This is one of the most stark examples of what United did differently than our competitors. Over the pandemic, we bet international would return strong, post-pandemic. And because we were the only airline around the world with that view of the recovery. We were also the only airline to make 2 important strategic decisions. We didn't retire wide-body aircraft, and we were the only airline in the world that negotiated a deal with our pilot union to keep pilots in place and in position, that allowed us to quickly bounce back. The decisions that our competitors around the globe made to retire aircraft and downgrade pilots take years to reverse. And because of that, they simply can't grow and you already see that in this summer's capacity data.\nOn Slide 8, I've already hit on the theme, so I'll try not to belabor it here, but United had a conscious strategy to use the pandemic to invest in the future. Our large aircraft orders were just the latest example of this. New plans are big-ticket items that get lots of attention. But other investments we've made in technology, infrastructure and people haven't drawn big headlines even though they too are essential to our success. The point here is that we really were unique. It wasn't just one thing and it wasn't just aircraft. It started with the fact that we always believed in a full recovery. And as a result, we invested and invested early.\nOn Slide 9, everything about this deck hopefully gives investors some comfort on why we have confidence in our margin targets. But I think there's potential for margins to go even higher, making Slide 9, the money slide for this entire deck for me at least. You can have whatever view you want about capacity, but what really matters is cost convergence. It's already happening, and I'm pretty sure it's going to continue. I believe a world where ULCCs pay their pilots significantly less than us, yet they can still hire and retain pilots, and they can somehow operate with previous staffing utilization levels is just the [nonsense], it's not a realistic scenario.\nAnd with cost convergence, if I were a betting man and actually I am, I'd bet that the revenue to GDP ratio is going back to the mid-5s. We'll see, and again, we expect to hit our margin targets even at the 0.49% level. But if it is true, I believe industry margins will go even higher. That's not our official guidance to be clear, but it's certainly possible.\nAnd so to conclude, I think the pandemic led to a structural change in the industry. The supply-demand dynamics are different than they've ever been in my career. I realize there's a lot of investor skepticism on that, but every data point keeps demonstrating it over and over again. And because United saw this ahead of everyone else, we were able to invest and prepare to take advantage of it. To be clear, I think margins across the board are going to be higher in the airline industry. But because of the unique steps we took to prepare for exactly this kind of recovery, you're also already seeing United's relative performance is as strong, and I expect that lead to just expand. A huge thanks to the entire United team. You're really doing an amazing job, and you are making United the biggest and the best airline in the history of aviation.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it off to Toby, who'll explain some of these critical investments, why they were important to the success of our operations through the most difficult holiday operating environment in my career. Toby?\n\nTorbjorn J. Enqvist\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Operations Officer, United Airlines, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott, and hello to everyone tuning in today. I first want to thank our employees for their exceptional performance over the holidays. We faced a really challenging operating environment that included some of the busiest days of the year and historical cold weather across most of our hubs and line station. While you wouldn't know it from the holiday travel headlines, United was actually the most impacted airline from a weather perspective. 36% of all our flights were exposed to severe weather between December 21 and December 26, more than any other airline in the country.\nAnd even though our load factors was already high, we accommodated thousands of additional customers on short notice when their travel and other airlines was disrupted. Despite these headwinds over the holidays, our team connected 90% of our customers within 4 hours of their planned arrival and served more than 8 million people, 1 million more than we did last year, and our operations performed very well, especially considered these tough conditions.\nUnited was among the airlines with a fewest cancellations during the holidays, and we were #1 in completion in Denver, San Francisco, Houston and Washington Dulles, and we practically eliminated all the related challenges and cancellations compared to the 2021 holiday period. So how did we do it? The answer lies in all the planning and investment we made during the depths of the pandemic. Instead of just trying to run the airline like we did in 2019, we worked over the last 3 years to prepare for a different, more complex operating environment and a sudden surge in travel demand.\nTo prepare specifically for the 2022 holiday period, we purposely built some slack in the schedule and reduced how often we fly during peak times. We accelerated our hiring and added staffing buffers in key locations. We built firewalls to prevent individual weather events from spilling over into broader network. And finally, we beefed up our training in every department, including clearing out the pilot training backlog to be resource ready for the peak travel demand season.\nAgain, as Scott said, our work to prepare goes back even further. Over the last 3 years, United invested in systems, training, tools and technology that would empower our employees and benefit our customers, including a modernized cruise scheduling system with 800% improvement in performance, capacity and security versus 2019, a smarter schedule and operations coordination to build reliable and operable schedules. Additional spare aircraft in our fleet, upgraded technology infrastructure supporting our network, operations, airport operations and maintenance teams.\nTogether with our industry-leading customer-facing technologies like ConnectionSaver and Agent on Demand, both of which now are integrated in our mobile app. Some of these investments are obviously more marketable than others, but they all make a difference in our performance. Finally, I want to point out the biggest difference maker for United this holiday season, our frontline teams. They worked as one team. They volunteer to pick up extra trips and work over time and again, break record-setting cold temperature. It was the combination of their dedication and the proactive investment in technology and infrastructure that led to our success.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Andrew to talk about the numbers.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Toby. TRASM for the fourth quarter finished up 25.8% and PRASM up 24.6% versus the same period in 2019, on 9.5% less capacity. This was similar performance to United's third quarter results and above the high end of our TRASM guidance for the quarter. TRASM growth or non-passenger revenue continued to outpace PRASM in Q4, although that will reverse in 2023, the reversal is due to cargo revenue declining year-over-year to new post-pandemic run rate that remained well above 2019 and co-brand credit card revenue growing slower relative to our rate of ASM growth for the year.\nPRASM in Q4 was strong across all parts of the network versus '19, with domestic results, up 23%, Latin, up 30%, Europe, up 11%, and Pacific, up 42%. International capacity in the quarter was down 12% and domestic was down 8%. Looking back at our revenue performance for all of 2022, our overall TRASM performance comparing to '19 was up 19.5%, about 6 points better than our expectation for the rest of the industry on average at this point and 3 points better than our network competitors during the same time period.\nTo meet our overall 2023 outlook, we're expecting flattish TRASM for the year versus 2022. The impact of cargo and other revenues on TRASM in '23 is a negative 2 to 3 points year-over-year, implying PRASM up about 2 to 3 points in our outlook. As we think about the revenue outlook for 2023, we are bullish about global long haul. We expect industry capacity across both the Atlantic and Pacific, where United is the largest carrier to be flattish versus 2019, which provides for an easy setup and positive RASM year-over-year.\nInternational demand remains incredibly strong, and we're looking at the potential for record profits and margins across our global network. Asia has traditionally been a margin drag on our global flying, but we've worked diligently to rebuild the network and close this gap. And we think 2023 will validate that we accomplish that goal. Asia is also close to being fully opened, allowing United to reestablish the bulk of the specific flying outside of China. It's worth noting that restrictions on the use of Russian airspace will constrain United from flying both of our China network in 2023. This same restriction will also limit our ability to fly to India. While I would not normally provide revenue details about the months within a quarter, I think it's important to share what we are seeing in Q1.\nOur unit revenue outlook for February and March is largely consistent with the levels we've seen in the past 3 quarters at roughly 25% higher than '19. We believe January is a negative outlier in Q1 with unit revenues compared to 2019 softer than the months after it. We think this is primarily due to holiday timing with less demand for incremental weekend trips, enabled by hybrid work schedules, so soon after the year-end holidays.\nBut we expect the second half of February and March to be back on trend with booked revenue already 30% to 40% above the same period in 2019, and I think this validates our excitement for 2023. Overall, we expect our Q1 TRASM to be up approximately 25% year-over-year.\nAnother positive catalyst for 2022 revenues is the continued, but slow recovery of traditional large corporate business travel. While November and December were low relative to October, it's great to see that January is materially better by about 5 points versus the average for Q4. January represents the start of a new budget year for most, so it's a great way to start the year. And we've heard often that budgets in 2022 were exhausted early as to why November and December travel were a bit disappointing for large corporate travel.\nI talked about the great setup we see in global long-haul earlier. We also see a nice setup for our domestic operations as constraints across the industry are everywhere, creating a favorable supply-demand environment. United is also now quickly executing on United next plans focused on gauge, premium seeding, revenue segmentation, signature interiors and most importantly, restoring and building connectivity, which suffered during the pandemic.\nWe're opening 17 new mainline gates in Newark and 20 in Denver in 2023, which will enhance our customer experience and improve reliability. In Denver, the new gates will allow us to grow our most profitable hub. And in Newark, the new gates will allow us to transition more flights to mainline from Express consistent with our United Next plans. In addition to gates, we opened more United Club space. In Newark, we have 69% more Club space and Denver will be up 180% versus 2019. We also have expanded Club space in Chicago by 40% with a new club that opened last week, and in Dallas by 43%. Most of these Club projects will soon be online and were planned during or prior to the pandemic. Importantly, there are more projects on the in the years to come.\nLooking beyond 2023, we continue to implement our United next plans. We've adjusted our upward -- our long-term gauge plan so that by 2026, our North American gauge will be up 25% versus 2022 and 40% versus 2019. United continues to be undersized in gauge as we await delivery of our large narrow body planes that are largely absent from our current schedule, creating a margin gap versus our potential and versus others that have a significant fleet size in this category.\nActivity suffered in 2022 due to a reduction in RJ flying capabilities and delays from Boeing. Pilot staffing at our regional operators has stabilized since pay changes went into effect, essentially matching one of our competitors combined with our Aviate program that provides a 4-year transition plan for pilots from an express job to a United mainline career. Regional jet utilization is showing signs of improvement, but we still have a long way to go, and it will be until about 2025 or beyond to get to normal. We have also signed a new agreement with Mesa to expand our large RJ flying in 2023 and associated small community service, while our relationship with Air Wisconsin comes through a natural end.\nWith this change, the number of regional partnerships is reduced from 6 to 5 and will eliminate approximately 40 single-class 50 CRJs that were not part of our long-term plans in exchange for adding dual-class 70 CRJs, a clear win for United, small communities and our customers. Rebuilding connectivity will be a key focus in 2023 and 2024 and will be significantly additive to RASMs as it was in 2018 and '19, giving us confidence as we do it with optimal gauge this time around. Thanks to the entire United team.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Gerry to discuss our financial results.\n\nGerald Laderman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and thank you to the whole United team for closing out the year strong, with adjusted pretax income of $1.1 billion, we came in ahead of our fourth quarter expectations and not only returned to pre-pandemic levels of profitability, but actually exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019 on both an operating and pre-tax margin basis. Even more encouraging, in the second half of 2022, we achieved an adjusted pretax margin of 9%, which matches our margin target for 2023 and puts us well on our way for that same success this year.\nTurning to costs. Our CASM-ex performance in the second half of 2022 meaningfully improved versus the start of the year. As I mentioned last quarter, a big driver of this success is the return of a grounded 777 to flying and further improvement in our operational reliability. As we know, a well-run operation is a more cost-efficient operation.\nLooking ahead, we expect first quarter 2023 CASM-ex to be down between 3% and 4%, with capacity up 20% versus the first quarter of 2022. On a full year basis, we expect 2023 CASM-ex to be about flat with capacity up high teens versus 2022. This full year cost outlook is inclusive of investments in the system that support operational reliability, our current expectations for new labor increases, representing about 4.5 points of CASM-ex, excluding any possible signing bonuses, and a higher inflation outlook for all parts of the business.\nOn the first point, one lesson learned during the pandemic recovery is that it is both economical and profit maximizing to provide cushion to our aircraft utilization. Instead of pushing utilization to its theoretical limit, we are focused on protecting our reliable operation. This minimizes delays and cancellations, which would otherwise drive higher costs, such as overtime and customary accommodation costs.\nTurning to our expectation on profitability. As Andrew mentioned, demand remains healthy. As a result, and using the January 10 forward curve for fuel prices, we expect our first quarter 2023 adjusted pre-tax margin to be around 3%, resulting in an adjusted diluted earnings per share between $0.50 and $1. Additionally, building on a successful second half of 2022 and with industry dynamics, Scott described at the start of the call, we feel even more confident about achieving our United Next 2023 adjusted pre-tax margin target of 9% and expected adjusted diluted earnings per share between $10 and $12 for the full year.\nOn aircraft, we currently expect to take delivery of 92 Boeing 737 MAXs, 2 Boeing 787s and 4 Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2023. Assuming all these aircraft are delivered, we now expect full year 2023 total adjusted capital expenditures to be around $8.5 billion. Even with this elevated level of CapEx based on the capacity, revenue and cost guidance we've outlined, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be positive for the full year.\nLooking beyond 2023, last month, we announced an aircraft order with Boeing that included 100 firm 787 aircraft, which will address much of our wide-body replacement needs through 2032. We also received options for up to 100 additional 787s that can be used for growth if there are margin accretive opportunities to do so. Additionally, the order included 100 incremental 737 aircraft to both meet planned United Next targets and start preparing for narrow-body replacements in 2027 and beyond.\nOur aircraft order book is one of our key assets as it provides us with both cost-saving replacement aircraft and the ability to take advantage of profit-enhancing growth opportunity. The cost of the flexibility built into the order book, we can also adjust the delivery timeline as the macro economy dictates.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with liquidity of $18 billion and reduced our adjusted net debt by $3.3 billion versus year-end 2021. We continue to balance liquidity levels with deleveraging activity and financing opportunities as we expect to end the year, having met our 2023 target of adjusted net debt to EBITDAR of less than 3x. We're entering 2023 with a strong foundation, and I want to recognize all of the hard work that has gone into running this great airline. We look forward to delivering to our customers, employees and investors in 2023.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Kristina for the Q&A."

My name is Candace, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Following the initial remarks from management, we will open the lines for questions. At that time, you may press pound 2 This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.\nI will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Kristina Munoz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKristina Munoz\n\nDirector of IR, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Candace. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and finance performance.\nAll forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to this company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release.\nJoining us on the call today to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Scott Kirby; President, Brett Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with the Q&A.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nCEO & Director, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning. It's great having everyone on the call today. I want to start by congratulating and thanking everyone at United for your hard work, dedication and perseverance throughout the last 2.5 years. Our people stay focused on our unique long-term strategy, and we're now beginning to see the strong and differentiated results.\nOur operation is firing on all cylinders. In fact, based on most metric, it's running better than ever. That isn't just better for customers. It also reduces costs and leads to strong financial performance that creates the foundation for United that really positions United to be the world's best airline. We recognize that the near-term geopolitical and macroeconomic risks and overall pessimism basing the global economy, including airlines, are unusually high right now.\nHowever, there are 3 industry tailwinds prevailing the COVID recovery for aviation and United that are currently overcoming those macro headwinds, and we believe will continue to do so in 2023. In increasing order of importance, first, aviation uniquely is still in the COVID recovery phase. Take 1 example. Japan just opened last week. And regardless of what you think demand for business travel will ultimately return to 100% or something less, it almost certainly is going higher from here.\nSecond, there's been a permanent structural change in leisure demand because of the flexibility that hybrid work allows. With hybrid work every weekend could be a holiday weekend. That's why September, a normally off-peak month was the third strongest month in our history. People want to travel and have experiences and hybrid work environments untether them from the office and give them the newfound flexibility to travel far more often than before. I'll bet many of you listening today have taken an extra trip or 2 this year, because you can work remotely for a couple of those days. This is not pent-up demand. It's the new normal.\nAnd third, the strong demand environment is happening against the supply backdrop that currently has the industry, 10% to 15% smaller relative to GDP than it was in 2019, and with multiple constraints, pilot shortages, aircraft delivery shortages from both Boeing and Airbus, air traffic control saturation and airport infrastructure constraints around the world are all real and they are constraints that will take years to fully resolve.\nThese 3 trends are why all airline revenues keep surprising to the upside, but they're also real and durable, which is why we're so optimistic about 2023 and the longer term despite the economic challenges. And for what it's worth, you need to believe all 3 of those trends were estimates to go up. Probably any 1 of them would do, though I happen to be confident that all 3 are already happening and are sustainable. And in that strong industry environment, United is uniquely positioned to benefit for the long term.\nUnited really did chart a different path due to pandemic than any other airline, differentiated fleet and growth decisions, increased exposure to growing international markets, real technology changes to change the customer experience and run the airline more efficiently, long-term investments in the infrastructure needed for growth to newer gates, building 14 additional simulator base during the pandemic, founding our own pilot training academy and a cultural transformation to be fast, creative, innovative and customer focused.\nIt is just 1 quarter, and we know we have a lot to prove, but our third quarter margin results and fourth quarter guidance with operating margins above 2019 are early indicators of both the absolute and relative potential of the new United Airlines. I am very proud of the United team for executing incredibly well, and I'm confident that we're well positioned for success next year and the years to come after that.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott. I also want to start by recognizing the entire United family for their hard work in the quarter. Our team never fails to pull together, and we couldn't be more proud. During the quarter, our operational performance set records. Our on-time arrival and disconnection rates were the best for a third quarter in company history when excluding the low flying quarters during the pandemic. We saved over 1,500 daily connections on average with our ConnectionSaver tool. This means over 137,000 additional customers got to their destinations on time. ConnectionSaver is a unique innovation and customer benefit for United.\nIn addition, our team did a fantastic job helping our customers and their bags get to their destination as seamlessly as possible. In fact, our mishandled bag ratio in September was better than 2019 levels. Our daily controllable cancels, which are driven by maintenance or crew challenges, dropped over 95% in September versus what they were in January.\nWith a reduction in these cancels alone, we were able to add 1% of incremental capacity to the third quarter. This provides a better experience for our customers but also leads to much more cost-efficient flying.\nWe look forward to continuing these trends into the final part of the year. Putting that all together and despite all the challenges around the industry, this was the best third quarter operationally for a full schedule in United's post-merger history, huge kudos to the team.\nOne of the most significant changes for United operationally and for cost has been return of the Pratt & Whitney Boeing 777s. As they're grounding, we've had to make suboptimal operational and scheduled jet adjustments that have led to a more complex operation and the work required to return these aircraft to service created a heavy burden on our Tech Ops organization. For the first time this -- for the first part of this year, we had over 500 of our technicians dedicated to this fleet in Victorville, California, with over 175,000 hours of work spent to get these aircraft back into service. This drove inefficiencies in our technician staffing with negative cost and operational impacts.\nThe great news is that this work is behind us. These technicians have returned to their basis which has led to the improvement in our performance metrics. With these aircraft fully back in service, our fleet can be more efficiently positioned for both our operations and our customers. I'd like to thank the entire Tech Ops organization for their significant effort and returning these aircraft to service.\nWe're proud that a career at United remains in high demand. This year, we're on track to hire 7,000 airport personnel, 4,000 flight attendants, 2,300 pilots and 2,000 technicians. Momentum is high. For example, a recent announcement for flight attendant openings received over 5,600 applications in just 48 hours. Ultimately, we expect to welcome 15,000 new team members this year and another 15,000 next year to support our United Next goal.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it off to Andrew to talk about the revenue environment in more detail.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. TRASM for the third quarter finished up 25.5% versus the same period in 2019 on about 10% less capacity. September was our third best TRASM month in our history, excluding the low flying pandemic months. We saw a number of record revenue days that were more typical of a peak summer period than off peak. In -- any way, September where we operated with an 86% passenger load factor, 5 points better than September of '19 was indicative of what we believe to be the new normal where hybrid work gives customers the flexibility to turn any weekend into a short trip, and we believe because of that, the off-peak periods are now stronger.\nAll parts of the network performed well in the quarter. First, across the Atlantic, United increased capacity by 22% versus the third quarter of 2019, adding 10 new cities and 18 new routes. We also pushed into new regions becoming a relevant competitor to Africa for the first time. New nonstop service between Washington and Cape Town, in fact, will begin later this year, that's subject to government approval.\nAtlantic PRASM increased 21% versus the third quarter of '19, which we consider outstanding. United is now the largest airline across the Atlantic, where our strategic partnership with Lufthansa and Air Canada is working better than ever. Last week, we announced yet another Atlantic expansion plan for 2023 of 9 new routes.\nA few weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Emirates. This partnership will allow United to resume service to Dubai, the largest and best hub in the Middle East after a 7-year absence. Dubai is unique as a hub in the region as it has both significant local markets, and a large amount of premium demand but also massive connectivity.\nWhile our Pacific flying is our least recovered so far from the pandemic, we continue to expand capacity as economies open. Overall capacity in the region was down 59% versus 2019 and Pacific PRASM increased 41% versus 2019, and we continue to experience much stronger cargo yields. We'll be focused on resuming the bulk of our Pacific capacity, excluding China in the next year now that Japan is fully open for business.\nWe continue to build our partnership with Virgin Australia. We will begin new nonstop service to Brisbane from San Francisco in a few weeks. We're the only airline that maintain continued service to Australia from the U.S. during the pandemic, and now United expects to be the largest airline operating to and from Australia this winter for the first time ever.\nLatin American PRASM was up 20% on 4% more capacity than 2019. Domestic PRASM was up 20.4% on 10.5% less capacity versus '19. Our domestic gauge versus '19 also increased 11% as we continue to replace regional jet flying with mainline jets. Gauge increases are being absorbed well without much of a negative impact on PRASM.\nCargo volumes were strong even as we face much more competitive capacity. Yields in the quarter did continue to fall, consistent with our expectations relative to pandemic highs and were 90% greater than 2019. The corporate business travel recovery in the quarter was about 80% of volume of '19 and stable over the quarter. While larger corporations clearly lagged the recovery rate, we believe new network patterns and hybrid work environments are having positive and offsetting impacts on revenue.\nIt's also worth noting that business traffic for long-haul segments across the Atlantic have recovered at a faster pace than domestic. It's our observation that a Zoom meeting is simply less practical in a global setting. We remain optimistic that business traffic will continue to get better from this point forward. Our traditional view on business traffic recovery rates relative to 2019 may now be obsolete measurement given the changes in how customers now travel in a remote work environment or business and leisure trips often are combined.\nNew revenue segmentation efforts versus '19 have been increasingly successful. Premium Plus, our new mid-tier global long-haul product is now 7% of our long-haul capacity, producing yields that are twice that of the main cabin. Our efforts to better market and sell main cabin seats have also produced strong results with seat revenue per passenger up 21% from 2019.\nSeptember was a strong revenue month, and we are entering the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum and October is on track to date to quickly replace September as our third best TRASM month ever, excluding the low flying pandemic months. In fact, we currently anticipate a similar TRASM increase in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third of between 24% and 25% on between 9% and 10% less capacity. While I recognize recent headlines would otherwise indicate our revenue performance should be faltering, I hope this strong revenue outlook puts those thoughts to rest.\nI wanted to briefly address some of the recent changes on RJ operating costs. We expect that these recent cost changes to alter the balance of pilots, choosing a career at United Express versus a ULCC. With competitive pay United Express versus ULCC for the first time, we'll be better able to staff our United Express operation, albeit at higher costs. United Express pilots who joined our AVA program can transition to a United (inaudible) job in 4 years, making it for the best short-term and long-term career option. We do expect that given the overall pilot shortage today, at non-legacy carriers, it may take a while and probably until 2026 to fully utilize in our 300 to 400 RJs we'd like to operate by our express partners.\nFinally, a quick update on our MileagePlus program. I have to say every key indicator we measure is positive. We've seen a record number of memberships to date with more enrollment so far this year than all of 2021. Mileage redemptions this quarter were the highest for any third quarter in our history and new co-brand accounts were up over 25% year-over-year, and we saw the highest quarter of spend in the history of the program in the third quarter. Momentum is strong, and we expect 2023 to set new records as we continue to grow the program. I wanted to say thanks to the entire United team.\nAnd with that, I will hand it over to Gerry.\n\nGerald Laderman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and a big thank you to the whole United team for achieving another quarter of profitability. As Brett mentioned, our recent operational performance has been record setting, and we believe the worst of the operational-driven cost pressures we've talked about on previous calls are now behind us.\nImportantly, we've completed all remedial work on our 52 Pratt-powered 777s and the vast majority are back in service with the last few expected to be online by next month. On previous calls, we have noted the significant CASM-ex headwinds driven by the ground of 777, but it was more than just the capacity implications. We believe -- as we piece together a schedule with a suboptimal mix of aircraft, we also incurred a variety of direct and indirect costs in many of our operating groups as we waited for the return to service of a significant portion of our wide-body fleet.\nTo put in context how impactful it is to have these aircraft flying again, our fleet was able to produce over 20% more ASMs for mainline aircraft per day in the third quarter compared to the first quarter. This provides a meaningful improvement in our utilization, which is 1 of the primary drivers of improved unit costs.\nLooking at the numbers for the third quarter. We reported pretax income of $1.1 billion on an adjusted basis and an operating margin of 11.5% also on an adjusted basis. This was 1 point better than our most recent guidance driven by a combination of stronger revenue and better costs. Our third quarter CASM-ex was up 14.5% versus the third quarter of 2019. This is a 1.5 points better than earlier expectations. The outperformance was driven in large part by our improved operational performance.\nA reliable operation is an efficient operation and a key to our strong unit cost performance today and for the future. As an example, Power's strong operation benefits our costs. In September, we saw a 27% reduction in the premiums and overtime paid as compared to an average month in the first half of the year. That equates to a $35 million improvement in September alone. This reduction in premium pay is expected to reduce fourth quarter CASM-ex by more than 1 point compared to the first quarter of this year. As we look into the future, retaining top-tier operational performance will continue to be a key element to our execution on costs.\nLooking ahead, we expect fourth quarter 2022 CASM-ex to be up between 11% and 12% with capacity down 9% to 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. As Andrew mentioned, we expect the revenue environment to remain strong throughout the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter 2022 adjusted operating margin to be about 10%, exceeding the fourth quarter of 2019 and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a metric we are happy to talk about again, of $2 to $2.25.\nIn the third quarter, we took delivery of 11 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and 1 Boeing 787 aircraft. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of 20 MAXs and 4 787s. Assuming these aircraft are delivered for the full year 2022, we now expect total adjusted capital expenditures to be $4.7 billion.\nOur most recent capacity guidance for next year assumes 179 aircraft deliveries from now through the end of 2023. There's certainly downside risk to that assumption but under almost any circumstance next year, we expect to take delivery of more aircraft in 1 year than any other airline in history. We continue to work closely with Boeing and Airbus regarding our deliveries we plan to provide you an updated outlook for 2023 in January.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with over $20 billion of liquidity, including our undrawn revolver, which allows us to maintain flexibility as we meet the uncertainties that remain in our industry. We used some of our cash to purchase all of our aircraft delivered to date this year, and we expect to use cash about half of the remaining deliveries in the fourth quarter. And remember that every aircraft purchased for cash today increases our pool of unencumbered assets, which further protects our future.\nIn addition to aircraft purchases beginning in 2023, we will have the opportunity to prepay a portion of our debt at par. In the current rate environment it is a tremendous benefit to have the flexibility to prepay debt, continue to pay cash for new aircraft or access the financing markets opportunistically for new aircraft deliveries. And at all times, we remain committed to restoring our balance sheet and working towards our long-term leverage targets. I again want to thank the whole United team for all we accomplished this quarter. We are executing our plan and making good progress towards our United Next goal.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Kristina for the Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nKristina Munoz\n\nDirector of IR, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hilda. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.\nAll forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.\nAlso, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures.

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line and available to assist with Q&A. And with that, I'll hand it over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nCEO & Director, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. I'd like to start by thanking our employees for navigating an unprecedented return of customers this quarter as well as managing the challenges seen around the world in the infrastructure that supports global aviation.\nIt's great to return to profitability for the first time since the start of the pandemic. And despite the legitimate worries about rising fuel prices and the growing risk of a slowdown or recession, we expect continuing improvement in revenue, earnings and margin going forward.\nWe're still short of our pre-pandemic margins, and we remain focused on first getting back to 2019 levels of profitability and then on achieving our 2023 and 2026 United Next adjusted pretax margin target.\nDuring 2Q, 3 storm clouds emerged that will drive the narrative around United and our industry for the next 6 to 18 months. And here at United, we're prepared for the risks they pose. First, we've seen industry-wide constraints that have created significant operational disruptions and impose constraints on the -- industries ability to grow; second, sharply elevated fuel prices; and third, the growing likelihood of an economic slowdown or recession.\nFirst, to address the challenges posed by a commercial aviation ecosystem that is straining to handle the number of planes operating today, we've elected to keep United Airlines smaller and overstaffed in order to give us more buffer against these external constraints that we just can't control.\nWe'll also continue to prioritize reliability by overstaffing until the entire aviation infrastructure returns to normal, but it means that there will be cost pressures until that catches up, and we can return to traditional utilization and staffing.\nThe second macro trend is, of course, fuel price. At current fuel prices, United's fuel bill would be $9 billion higher than 2019. For what it's worth, we're building our long-term plans, assuming that this is the new normal for fuel prices. The good news is that rising fuel costs are something that affects all airlines and at least for United, we've seen this largely become a pass-through event to date.\nAnd finally, there's the question about what's going to happen with demand. We continue to see strong demand. And one thing that is unique for United, particularly, and aviation in general, is that we're still probably in the sixth or seventh inning of the COVID recovery.\nSo there are 2 macro demand trends, recession versus continuing COVID recovery working across purposes. And for now at least, the COVID recovery trend is at least canceling out and arguably exceeding the economic headwinds. So where does that leave us as we look to the future? Clearly, all 3 looming risks, industry infrastructure constraints, significantly higher fuel prices and an economic slowdown, biased toward reducing capacity over the next 6 to 18 months.\nBut the truth is 8% is about as much as we think it's physically possible for us to fly given the shortfall in regionals, reduction in long-haul Asia flying and aircraft delivery delays and other infrastructure constraints that are impacting all of aviation.\nPerhaps what's most amazing about all this is despite 3 known storm clouds, however, we remain optimistic about the near and short term. You can see that our 3Q results are expected to continue to accelerate back towards 2019 margin. Lower stage length does lead to lower ASM growth in pressures CASM-ex. And Gerry will detail what that means shortly.\nHowever, these same factors also lead to higher RASM. In order to hit our adjusted pretax margin of 9% next year, TRASM could decelerate by 8 points from current levels, and we'd still hit the target. That translates to about $11 per share in adjusted EPS.\nAnd that, perhaps, is the most important point. At United, we will do whatever it takes to hit our margin targets. We made a huge step up in 2Q, and we continue to get closer to 2019 levels here in 3Q. We believe utilization will return to normal and Boeing deliveries will get back on track, which are the keys to CASM-ex.\nBut we're going to get to our pretax margin next year regardless. Thank you again to our employees for all they've done to help our customers during this busy summer travel season. It's been tough, but I'm encouraged to see the improvement in operating results and customer NPS so far in July. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott. I want to start by thanking the entire United team for their hard work in the past few months. We are pleased to see how the recovery has taken hold and progress made in our international business as border and testing requirements began to loosen up.\nAs Scott mentioned, crew, weather and air traffic constraints have severely impacted the entire industry over the last few months. However, because of the United teams' unwavering hard work, we were able to return to 2019 levels of operational performance in the second quarter for most of our network with the exception of Newark.\nWhile June completion was the most challenging since 2019, our mainline operation was ranked #1 among legacy peers for the quarter. The good news is the biggest constraint we have seen at United congestion at Newark has improved. But we'll need to operate at lower utilization and higher staffing levels until the broader aviation infrastructure improves. United continues to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Transportation on the operational disruptions and challenges impacting the aviation industry and our customers.\nBy having an active partnership with the government and FAA, we hope to address the main drivers of these challenges and find solutions together. We've seen early signs of progress and are grateful for the partnership and leadership the FAA has demonstrated.\nLate last month, we received waiver to proactively reduce our schedule in Newark to ease operational disruption for our customers. Also, our on-time departure performance at Newark has improved significantly, nearly 14 points month-over-month so far.\nAs we continue to manage the infrastructure challenges that face the aviation industry and the broader economy, we're strategically maintaining higher staffing levels and will need to operate at lower utilization. We continue to adjust our near-term capacity plan to fly the most reliable schedule we can.\nFinally, we are hiring to support a larger operation so that our new United team members can receive proper classroom and on-job training in advance of when they are needed as we plan to grow schedule towards our long-term goals.\nThe pilot shortage continues to impact broader airline industry. United remains dedicated to hiring at least 200 pilots a month, and with our international routes, wide-body aircraft and higher career -- and high career earning potential, we are confident United is the best place for pilots to build a career.\nIn closing, I want to extend my most sincere gratitude to the entire team at United for their hard work this quarter. Our employees are truly the good that leads the way for our airline. And now I'd like to hand the call over to my colleague, friend and our new Chief Operating Officer, Toby Enqvist.\n\nTorbjorn J. Enqvist\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Customer Officer, United Airlines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brett, for that kind introduction. After working for this great airline for over 25 years, and most recently as a Chief Customer Officer, the thing that customers value the most have not changed. We need to get them to their destination safely and on time.\nHence, running a reliable operation is critical to our success. And with the recent wave of industry-wide operational disruptions across the globe, it was the innovative tools, such as the ConnectionSaver and Agent on Demand from our team that helped moderate the stress, not only for our customers but for our employees as well. We will continue to eat to make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and reliability of our operation in the future.\nAt United, we've been preparing for this bounce back in demand for some time. We were the only airline that signed a letter of agreement with our pilots in the fall of 2020 to ensure that when demand returns, and it has in a more meaningful way than we could have ever imagined, we'd be ready.\nFor example, today, we have 10% more pilots available for block hour versus prior to the pandemic. Further, we broke ground on 12 new simulator bays to support the amount of pilots...\n(technical difficulty)\n\nOperator\n\nYour conference will resume shortly. Please, stand by.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, everyone. Sorry, we had some technical difficulties. We're going to start with Toby.\n\nTorbjorn J. Enqvist\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Customer Officer, United Airlines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brett, for the kind introduction. After working for this trait airline for over 25 years and mostly as the Chief Customer Officer, the thing our customers value to most has not changed. We need to get them through the destination safely and on time. And so running a reliable operation is critical to our success. And the recent wave of industry-wide operational disruption across the globe, it was the innovative tools, such as ConnectionSaver and Agent on Demand from our team that helped moderate the stress not only for our customers, but for our employees as well.\nWe will continue to innovate and make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and reliability of our operations in the future. As to now, we've been prepared for this bounce back in demand for some time. We were the only airline that signed a letter of agreement with our pilots in the fall of 2020 to ensure that when demand returns, and it has in a more meaningful way than we could have ever imagined we'd be ready.\nFor example, today, we have 10% more pilots available for block hours versus prior to the pandemic. Further, we broke ground on 12 new simulator bays for the amount of pilot training that we expect will be required in the near, medium and long term to meet our growth plan.\nWe also began actively addressing our infrastructure well before demand started to come back. During COVID focus on the big airport infrastructure projects to support in the future. We completed or broke ground on new projects at Newark, Chicago O'Hare, Houston and Denver.\nThere are many other infrastructure constraints outside of our control, and we worked with those partners to get them returned to normal. Finally, July 4 weekend was our best completion in CD (inaudible) performance for that reason since 2017.\nIn partnership with the FAA, our Newark operation is significantly improving this fun. As of July 15, we have seen a 78% reduction, which is the highest post-pandemic month in FAA capacity delay way, which means an additional 12,000 customers are on some each and every day. The delays on this market could impact the rest of our system.\nI look forward to being even more ingrained in the day-to-day operating of this airlines. And hopefully by the next time I'm on this call, the operational challenge that our whole industry faces today will be the rear view mirror. I'll now pass it on to Andrew to discuss our great revenue results.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Toby. I'm pleased to report revenues accelerated in the quarter versus Q1. TRASM finished 24% higher with capacity down 15% versus Q2 '19. Top line revenues for June of $4.6 billion were 12% or above our previous best month ever on 14% less capacity. Q2 leisure demand was exceptionally strong, and we successfully revenue managed our capacity, largely compensating for higher fuel costs and inflationary pressures.\nPassenger yields were up 20%. Business demand continued to rebound into the quarter to 75% of 2Q '19 volume levels and 80% of revenues. Business demand continues to grow but the rate of progress has slowed in the last few weeks from the growth we saw early in the quarter.\nWith the economy potentially worsening and business travel recovery, something we'll be watching carefully. Cargo demand remained strong in Q2. Yields remained 107% above 2019 levels and total cargoed revenue was up 95% versus '19.\nAs we see, the industry pool back up to normal passenger schedules, we expect cargo yields will decline in the future months but remain solidly above 2019 levels. I want to also note that our cargo volumes remained strong and are only constrained by available space now being used by passenger luggage.\nIf a drop-off in cargo revenues is an early sign of a recession, we don't see it. MileagePlus had a strong quarter with revenues up 23% versus 2Q '19. Our co-branded credit card broke just about every record you can think of in terms of spend, retention and new cards issued.\nOur ancillary and premium revenue streams are also doing great. Ancillary revenue per onboard passenger was up almost 30% versus '19. Additionally, our steep product revenues per passenger were almost up 40%. As I've mentioned before, premium leisure continues to be a bright spot with the premium cabin domestic revenue growth, outpacing the economy cabin in the second quarter.\nThis trend is really important as our United Next capacity plans grows premiums even faster than main cabin over the next few years. For Q2, Pacific PRASM increased 15%, albeit on a capacity down 67%. Atlantic PRASM was up 6%, even in the backdrop of a 9% capacity growth versus '19, and Latin PRASM was up 14% in the quarter on 8% more capacity.\nOverall, international PRASM was up 13%. Domestic PRASM increased 25%, and that's with a backdrop of an 8% increase in gauge, versus Q2 '19, a material reduction in RJ feeder traffic and many other constraints that limit optimal capacity deployment.\nThe strength of the post-COVID recovery, combined with capacity constraints, are offset in any macroeconomic headwinds, enabling record TRASM results. Now turning to the third quarter. We're focused on carefully managing our capacity, yield and operation with schedules we can reliably and profitably deliver.\nWe expect third quarter capacity will be down approximately 11% versus third quarter of '19. Q3 TRASM is expected to improve by 24% to 26% versus the same period in 2019. International TRASM is now spooling up further.\nWe're well into the Q3 booking curve and pleased with the revenue trends. We're not counting on a material rebound in business bookings in the quarter to meet our TRASM guide. United's capacity in the fourth quarter will also remain below our original targets at approximately down 11%.\nThe revenue environment for passengers, ancillary fees, domestic premium seating, MileagePlus and cargo are all just materially different in a positive way than 2019. It appears to us that the airline industry revenues are rapidly returning to the 2019 GDP relationship, which is really important to our 2023 capacity planning outlook.\nWe continue to assess capacity plans for 2023 and now expect United capacity will be up about 8%. To be transparent, our outlook for growth -- 8% growth is significantly lower than our previous planned growth. we at United are going to be able to execute our plan and do it comfortably.\nWe feel 8% growth is the right choice and achievable for United. At United taking care of our customers is our #1 focus, and we believe that moderating capacity growth will allow us to deliver service levels our customers expect. The entire industry faces at least 3 core challenges over the next 18 to 24 months. One, industry infrastructure shortfall; two, high fuel prices; and three, macroeconomic concerns.\nSome airlines, including United, faced a fourth risk that not all others may face, delivery delays from Boeing. These constraints are clearly having a material positive impact on revenue production. Higher fuel prices and macro recommenced alone may not have impacted industry capacity.\nHowever, infrastructure constraints and bone delivery delays will take time to fix and cannot be ignored. Pilot recruiting, training and retention, we believe, are real constraints for the industry for years to come. As Scott has said earlier, the calculation of how we get to our 2023 margin guidance has changed.\nWe will have higher cost, higher fuel, lower capacity, but most importantly, higher revenues. Thanks to the entire United team. And with that, I will hand it over to Gerry to discuss our financial results.\n\nGerald Laderman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. First, I would like to add my thanks to the entire United team for achieving our first quarter of profitability since the start of the pandemic. For the second quarter of 2022, we reported pretax income of $459 million, $611 million on an adjusted basis.\nOur second quarter CASM-ex ended up 17% versus the second quarter of 2019, which was in line with our prior guidance despite capacity coming in lower than previously expected. But the cost story for the quarter was not about CASM-ex. It was about fuel and the ability of air industry, while in the midst of recovering from the pandemic, to withstand record high fuel prices.\nThe fuel price volatility was exacerbated by unusual pressure on jet fuel prices in certain geographic regions where we had limited opportunity to mitigate our exposure. For example, in April and May, the cost of jet fuel based on New York harbor pricing was often several dollars higher per gallon than Gulf Coast jet fuel.\nNonetheless, our strong unit revenue performance enabled us to offset most of the fuel pressure as we attained an adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of just over 8%. While lower than our May guidance of 10%, the difference is mostly due to approximately $150 million of incremental fuel expense for the quarter versus what we forecasted in May.\nTurning to our forward outlook. We currently expect CASM-ex to be up approximately 16% to 17% in the third quarter and capacity down 11%, both versus the third quarter of 2019. Our third quarter costs are impacted by the current operating environment. During the recovery period where supply chain issues, labor shortages and COVID variants create challenges throughout the economy, we are mitigating the impact to our operation and our customers by overstaffing and limiting capacity.\nWhile this creates near-term CASM headwind, we believe it is the right thing to do for our customers and ultimately for our profitability. We also have to manage more closing cancellations due to various infrastructure issues. For example, for several weeks in September, we are reducing our schedule in Newark by about 200 flights per day as a result of runway construction.\nThese types of cancellations result in additional CASM ex pressure as many variable costs simply cannot be avoided due to the short lead time for the schedule adjustments. Nonetheless, we once again expect to be profitable in the third quarter and expect our adjusted operating margin to be 10% based on a fuel price per gallon of $3.81.\nAdditionally, we continue to expect an adjusted pretax profit for the full year 2022. Looking beyond the third quarter, we will continue to manage our capacity growth into next year prudently. We currently expect our fourth quarter capacity down 10% with our CASM-ex up 14%.\nIn addition, as Andrew described, we now expect full year 2023 capacity to be up no more than approximately 8% versus 2019, down from the original United next goal of 20%. Even at this lower capacity for next year, we feel good about achieving our United Next adjusted pretax margin target.\nAfter taking into account the impact of lower capacity, causing, for example, fixed cost to be spread among fewer ASMs, and about 3 points of inflationary pressure we've seen, we would expect CASM-ex to be up about 5% versus 2019.\nUsing a fuel price per gallon of $3.40 based on the current forward curve, unit revenue can decline by as much as 8 points from current levels, and we would still achieve the 9% United Next adjusted pretax margin target. And as Scott mentioned, as our assumptions change, we will do what it takes to deliver on our commitment.\nTurning to fleet. Our new aircraft delivery schedule for this year continues to shift a little to the right. We now expect to take delivery of no more than 46 MAX aircraft and 5 787s during the year. We currently expect full year 2022 adjusted CapEx of about $5.2 billion, which will be lower to the extent fewer aircraft are actually delivered.\nWe finally started taking delivery of our first new aircraft of the year during the last week in June, and in the last few weeks, we have taken delivery of 4 737 MAX aircraft. We continue to evaluate the most appropriate way to pay for our new aircraft deliveries in the context of our liquidity position, other potential uses of our cash in the current macro environment.\nGiven that we ended the second quarter with about $22 billion of liquidity and we used cash on hand to purchase the 4 aircraft already delivered this year, and currently, we expect to pay for more than half of our total 2022 aircraft deliveries with cash on hand, though we remain flexible as we continue to monitor the economy and the recovery.\nPaying for these aircraft with cash while paying down current maturities and opportunistically prepaying certain debt to build our unencumbered asset base, a win-win for the balance sheet. So far this year, we have reduced our total debt by over $1 billion. And with scheduled debt payments between $3 billion and $4 billion annually for the next several years, we will continue to have the ability to delever our balance sheet through normal amortization.\nIn conclusion, as we execute our network cost and balance sheet plans, which form the core of our United Next strategy, we grow more confident every day that we will deliver on our 2023 and 2026 adjusted pretax margin target. And with that, I will hand it over to Kristina to start the Q&A.\n\nKristina Munoz\n\nDirector of IR, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gerry. We will now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to 1 question and if needed, 1 follow-up question. Hilda, please describe the procedure to ask a question."

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nCEO & Director, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Emily, and thank you all for joining us today. I want to start this morning by saying a huge thank you to the United team. Our mission is uniting people and connecting the world. And the foundation of United's success will always be the strength of our people.\nIn the first quarter of this year, our team members continued to go above and beyond to take care of our customers and each other in what was a really difficult industry operating environment. The United team is stronger than ever. Our customers are seeing it, and I, along with the entire leadership team, are grateful to them.\nOur United Next strategy is firmly on track, and we're well on our way to our goal to build the biggest, best, the most profitable major airline in the history of the industry.\nEven during the early days of the pandemic, we were determined to do much more than just survive the pandemic and get back to normal. We've spent the last 2 years getting United ready -- Airlines ready for this moment. We finally reached the inflection point as we transition from pandemic to endemic. And demand is stronger than I've ever seen in my career, and that's even before business travel fully recovers, though it continues to accelerate at a rapid pace and before international, especially Asia, fully recovers.\nWe expect that will lead to the best TRASM and highest quarterly revenue in our history in 2Q. And despite the higher fuel prices, we're forecasting approximately a 10% operating margin this quarter.\nThe rapid acceleration we're seeing in business and long haul as they move to catch up to still-strong domestic leisure demand, gives us great confidence in the future outlook, but there are three reasons we believe investors should think that the hard work and strategic thinking that we're focused during the pandemic, have United best positioned, going forward.\nThe first, the United brand and customer preference. Throughout the pandemic, we've talked about our desire to decommoditize air travel, and we've told you how strong our NPS scores are. If I look back at history, what we're really doing is trying to replicate what Continental successfully accomplished back in the '90s and Delta did about 15 years ago.\nThose two airlines shifted to a strong customer focus, and customers began to choose them because of their improved customer interactions and brands. The result was rapid improvement in relative TRASM, which led to rapid improvement in cash flow and earnings, which led to significant stock price outperformance.\nFor anyone paying attention, there have been hints that the same thing was happening at United throughout the pandemic, as we led major carriers in TRASM, 7 out of the last 8 quarters. But that really was the warm-up.\nI recognize we still have a lot to prove, and we must keep executing, but our TRASM outlook for 2Q is another strong indicator that customers are now choosing United much like they began choosing Continental and Delta 30 and 15 years ago.\nSecond, CASM-ex. There are a lot of industry pressures on capacity and CASM-ex, but I'm confident that United is set up to outperform by a wide margin. We do have timing issues with 777s, Boeing delivery delays and all the industry infrastructure required to bring capacity back reliably. And doing so reliably is our top focus.\nBut ultimately, our gauge is going to grow approximately 30% by 2026. And that, more than anything, is going to drive the significant CASM-ex outperformance we expect at the same time, improving the product for our customers.\nThree, United is uniquely positioned to benefit from fading COVID headwinds. As Andrew will detail, business travel is rapidly returning but it's still not fully recovered.\nAnd we expect United will benefit more than any other airline as that recovery continues, and international, especially Asia, is far from fully recovered. United is just more exposed to those sectors that we expect to have the most acceleration in the coming quarters.\nIf you're going to invest in airlines, I think any of those three reasons should move United to the top of your pecking order. But I'll give you one more, I think, underappreciated reason for why you should invest in airlines in the first place.\nAt United, we've talked in the past about the vastly improved supply dynamics in the long-haul international markets, but we've been worried about the domestic markets. For reasons I'll describe, I now think the domestic market is also going to be robust.\nI think every single person listening to this call that has a spreadsheet with a forecast of industry capacity in the years to come, is wrong and probably wrong by a lot. The pilot shortage for the industry is real, and most airlines are simply not going to be able to realize their capacity plans because there simply aren't enough pilots, at least not for the next 5-plus years.\nGiven the work that we've done on our brand and customer experience, United, of course, isn't having any problems hiring pilots. We are always top tier for pilot pay, have a ton of growth opportunities for pilots coming soon. And we have, by far, the largest number of higher wide -- higher-paying, wide-body flights and positions.\nBut that's not all. United, increasingly, is where employees, including airline pilots, want to build a career. They see the lucrative financial opportunities that I just mentioned, but they also recognize that United is an airline where they can be proud to work.\nFrom running a consistently top-tier operation to exciting new investments in our customers' experience to Supersonic aircraft orders to being a force for good in the communities we serve, we're building an airline that leads, and that is where the best in the industry want to build a long-term career.\nIn fact, we now see a lot of pilots from other airlines applying to be pilots at United, and that's new behavior.\nWhile we are in a good position for the smaller and mid-tier airlines, there just aren't enough pilots to staff their growth aspirations. The other really large airlines will also probably be able to attract enough pilots. But for anyone else, I just don't think it's mathematically possible to meet the pilot demand for the capacity plans that are out there.\nYou can already see the issues that are occurring at multiple smaller and mid-tier airlines over pilot shortages. And looking forward, when United alone is ramping up higher about 200 pilots per month, that situation is only going to get worse. This is not a temporary issue.\nBecause of that, I now think the domestic TRASM environment is going to be much stronger in the years to come than we previously thought because supply is going to be constrained by lack of pilots. You put all that together, and we feel very bullish. The last 2 years have obviously taught us that macro events can quickly change our outlook.\nBut our 2Q base expectation has us just 350 basis points shy of our 2019 adjusted operating margin. And we expect that our plans to bring the 777s back continue to gradually add back capacity and grow gauge are going to drive CASM-ex down significantly from their still COVID-elevated levels.\nWe're also confident that the robust business travel recovery still has a lot of room to run, and we anticipate improvement in long-haul Asia that is not yet reflected in our revenue results.\nThat means we're more confident than ever that we'll meet or exceed our approximately 9% adjusted pretax margin target for next year. And particularly with our view of the supply dynamics in both domestic and international, getting to at least our 14% target for 2026 seems pretty straightforward.\nI've been in this industry for a long time now and seen some ups and lots of big downs. Looking back, there seems to be about once-in-a-decade opportunity, where the sentiment gets so bearish and the actual future outlook is so different from that sentiment that there's a significant outperformance for airline stocks for a few years.\nI think supply constraints, pilots being the biggest one, means that this is that time again. And when that's happened in the past, the whole industry tends to do well, but usually 1 or 2 airlines do much better than the rest of the pack.\nI've already listed the reasons above, and I suppose I'm not entirely objective, but it sure seems like United is a bet you want to make in that environment.\nBefore I turn it over to Brett, I want to congratulate our CFO, Gerry Laderman, on becoming a first-time grandfather. I'm sure you'll hear the excitement in his voice later today. Well, maybe not. But I promise you, Gerry is really excited. And congratulations to that cute baby, grandson. Brett?\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott. Last month, we were honored to be included in Time's 100 Most Influential Companies for 2022. Our placement on Time's list, last quarter, coincided with the announcement of Scott's appointment to the Homeland Security Advisory Council and the White House's announcement of my appointment to President Biden's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\nUnited continues to be firmly committed to being a leader in corporate America and investing in the future of our company for both customers and employees. We're proud to be recognized for the hard work, the entire United family, over the last year.\nBecoming the best airline means not only being an industry leader on safety and innovation but also reliably getting our customers where they want to go on time and with their bags.\nThroughout the pandemic, and during the recent recovery, the commercial aviation system has been stressed by supply chain constraints and staffing shortfalls at the FAA, TSA and airport vendors, among other factors, all of which tests the stability of every airline's operation.\nSome airlines built larger schedules that tested the limits of what they could operate, leaving their customers and their reputation to pay the price.\nUnited chose a different path. We anticipated many of these challenges, even taking steps on our own to mitigate them. Importantly, we also made a conscious decision to prioritize our operational reliability by limiting the size of our schedule.\nThat decision may have cost us some profits in the near term, but it's the right long-term decision for our customers, our company and the bottom line. We'll continue to use that approach as we plan to add capacity in the months ahead.\nIn recent weeks, the people of United and our customers have come together to assist the people of Ukraine. United has donated $100,000 and more than 2 million frequent flyer miles to help transport relief workers and supplies to those on the front line of the crisis. As early as March, we announced fund raising efforts to support our humanitarian relief partners.\nAnd our customers stepped up [to help] as they so often do. They donated 12.6 million frequent flyer miles and nearly $0.5 million to provide health care, shelter, food and other life-saving services to refugees. We appreciate our customers' generosity and are proud to team with them to support the victims of the conflict in Ukraine.\nWe continue to make progress towards our hiring needs as we look towards United Next. This January, we celebrated opening our Aviate Academy in Arizona and welcome the next generation of pilots to the United family. This flight training school is the first of its kind, and we believe it will help to maintain a pipeline of qualified pilot candidates for United as our industry looks to combat the pilot shortage.\nWe are particularly proud of providing the opportunity for aspiring pilots from diverse background to study and train at the Aviate Academy. Over the next 8 years, we plan to train 5,000 new pilots at Aviate, with the goal of at least half being women or people of color.\nWe are also continuing our path as the industry leader in sustainability. United remains the only airline that is committed to becoming 100% green by reducing 100% of our greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets. And in 2021, we established a strong midterm goal of reducing our carbon intensity to 50%, compared to 2019, by the year 2035.\nOur dedication to creating a greener tomorrow through real change is stronger than ever. We are investing in solutions that have the potential to actually reduce and ultimately remove the emissions from flying. In March, we announced a collaboration with biotech Cemvita to commercialize the production of sustainable aviation fuel.\nWhile we are proud to have invested in more sustainable aviation production than any other airline in the world, we're also focused on making solutions like these scalable for the future.\nWe also continue to engage with cross-industry partners and policymakers to support the case for urgent climate action. Through these and other actions, we are committed to making a real difference in climate change.\nA key part of our sustainability progress will be enabled by technology, but at United, we're also focused on using technology to enhance the travel experience.\nCurrently, nearly 3/4 of our customers use our app on the day of travel, a valuable tool that helps our customers manage their travel instead of having to call the contact center or speak with an agent. While this helps our employees to be more efficient, we know from our survey data that customers who use our mobile app, are more satisfied with their experience with United.\nThis is why we continue to invest in new features like enhanced flight search options, better visibility into flight credits, contactless payment through the United Wallet and a new bag drop shortcut, allowing you to zip through the airport lobby faster when you check a bag in the app before arriving at the airport.\nAs we adapt to COVID-19 becoming endemic, we need our customer and employee experience to reflect this new phase. We are pleased to see indoor mask requirements are now gone for 99% of the country as well as onboard domestic flights, select international flights, depending on arrival countries' mask requirements and at U.S. airports.\nWe strongly believe the administration should eliminate the predeparture testing requirements for transportation as well. While travel demand is surging, we believe eliminating these requirements will ease the travel experience for our customers.\nIn closing, I would like to express appreciation to our entire United team, who has been critical throughout this inflection point. While we've always remained committed to our United Next strategy, the recent momentum and demand environment gives us even more confidence in United's path forward. I'll now hand it over to Andrew to discuss this in more detail.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. I normally start each earnings call with an update on the previous quarter's revenue performance. However, today, it just seems more appropriate to start off with our Q2 outlook. We clearly passed a major inflection point with demand and yields and have a confident view of the future.\nQ2 TRASM is expected to be up 17% versus Q2 of '19, a step-change increase from our Q1 TRASM was down 3%. We're confident that United is currently set up to achieve record TRASM and revenue results in the second quarter. The revenue inflection point started in March with TRASM up 9% versus 2019.\nRevenue momentum is coming from just about every category, including higher yields, ancillary seat sales, strong premium leisure demand, MileagePlus, rebound in business demand and a record-setting season across the Atlantic this summer. Even parts of Asia are rebounding.\nWe often have talked about United's high exposure to business traffic and the resulting headwind that the pandemic caused. United produced industry-leading TRASM results during most of the pandemic, even when faced with this substantial headwind.\nNow, with business traffic rapidly recovering, I expect United to have a tailwind versus more leisure-focused carriers, a fact, I think, we can see in our Q2 guidance.\nBusiness revenue for the last few weeks has been down about 30%, with the last week now down only 20% versus the same period in 2019. Large corporations are now returning to travel at a faster rate than small. This is really important to United's Q2 outlook. As of last week, business yields are now close to up 10% ahead of 2019.\nGiven these revenue trends, business TRASM contribution is expected to be approximately 100% of 2019 levels soon. After all the debates about the return of business traffic, it's nice to see this important milestone in sight, even with many businesses not fully back in the office.\nDemand for business, leisure and cargo traffic continues to be strong, even as we pass on 100% of the fuel price increase versus '19. The United bookings for Q2 are strong, and we believe we still have sufficient room to sell peak period travel at robust yields.\nYield momentum is generally very strong across most of our regions. Across the Atlantic, we expect to grow by 25% this summer, becoming the largest airline in that region for the first time.\nWe also see momentum in Australia and many other countries that have opened their borders and expect further gains when the inbound U.S. testing requirements are relaxed. In Q2, we expect to operate Pacific capacity down about 65% versus '19 and Latin American capacity up 9% versus '19.\nCargo continues to produce strong results, with revenues up 26% in Q1 of 2022 versus 2021 and up 119% versus 2019. Ocean shipping and supply chain disruptions continue to boost our revenue outlook for cargo.\nDuring the pandemic, we found many traditional United structural advantages, including our business-centric digital health and long-haul network to be temporary disadvantages.\nUnited's network during the pandemic, even with all the changes we implemented, was simply less focused on domestic markets, small communities, Florida and near Latin America, which all performed better during the pandemic. And our Pratt & Whitney 777s were grounded, which meant we couldn't take full advantage of strength to and from Hawaii.\nImagine now United's revenue potential in the context of our Q2 guide when areas which have been structural advantages, including business traffic, coastal gateways and global long haul, fully bounce back, combined with a new, moderate and fuel-efficient fleet.\nImagine the United were 50-seat single-class jets only fly to small communities and don't compete against competitor's operating mainline jets at a fraction of the unit cost. Imagine a world where United offers premium seats everywhere our competitors do, when in the past, we often had none.\nIf you have a hard time imagining these things and the impact on our revenues, I just want to point you to our Q2 revenue guide. Global long-haul flying is an area where we have a structural advantage. Opening of the border is transformational for us. We are confident that retaining all of our wide-body jets during the pandemic was the right call. As we think about growth potential for the long haul, we remain bullish on all of the long-haul opportunities.\nI've often talked about the challenges we expect on the domestic front in the coming years, with supply growing faster than demand. However, we increasingly doubt the ability of the industry to execute on previously planned growth levels. There is no single fix to issues constraining capacity, and as a result, there's no quick fix.\nAt a macro level, we expect less supply in the coming years. However, we still expect industry capacity growth to be more elevated in Florida, smaller communities, where United has less exposure.\nWith this updated domestic outlook, our view of the revenue performance and profitability of domestic flying has improved. We have confidence in our ability to execute our United Next plan with known constraints, the largest, of course, being the pilot shortage.\nThe pandemic delayed many of our commercial initiatives, including the full rollout of Premium Plus and Polaris cabins on the long-haul fleet. But today, we are nearing the end of these projects, so that we have a consistent and leading product. We continue to offer basic economy with even more flexibility to our customers seeking the best possible price.\nOur investments in planes, clubs and gates will be transformational. We'll provide our customers with choices that others don't offer, across multiple product types and desired service levels, along with the very best global network and the very best partners of any U.S. carrier.\nI wanted to thank the entire United team for their dedication over the last 2 years. We're set up well for the future, and that future begins today. With that, I will hand it off to Gerry.\n\nGerald Laderman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2022, we reported a pretax loss and an adjusted pretax loss of around $1.8 billion. Our CASM-ex ended the quarter in line with the guidance we provided last month, at up 18% versus first quarter 2019.\nLooking ahead, even with the elevated fuel prices, which we expect to persist for a while, right now, we are seeing our revenue more than cover the increased fuel cost, and as a result, we expect to achieve meaningful pretax income in the second quarter. Furthermore, based on our current revenue expectations, we also expect to produce a pretax profit for the full year 2022.\nWe currently expect our CASM-ex to be up around 16% in the second quarter on capacity, down around 13%, both versus the second quarter of 2019. We also expect that our unit costs will continue to sequentially improve over the remaining quarters of 2022.\nAs the 52 grounded 777 aircraft returned to normal service, we start to take delivery of additional large narrow-body aircraft and our aircraft utilization increases. We believe these capacity levers will drive a step function change in CASM-ex through 2022 as the relationship between our capacity growth and CASM-ex improvement continues to meet our expectations.\nOur team has done a tremendous job managing all the costs under our control, and we expect that focus to continue. However, the impact of continuing elevated inflation and the exact timing of the 777 return to service generally makes precise forecasting difficult. Nonetheless, we are confident that our CASM-ex exit rate for the year will set us up well for 2023 and beyond.\nTurning to fleet. As you know, new aircraft deliveries constitute the vast majority of our capital expenditures. We are reducing our adjusted CapEx expectations for the year by approximately $600 million to $5.3 billion as a result of supply chain and manufacturing challenges pushing some of our expected 787 and 737 MAX deliveries from this year to next year.\nWhile it is difficult to say with precision how many aircraft may fly, right now, we are assuming 2 of 8 787s and 7 of 53 737 MAXs will slip to 2023. Those aircraft will join the 737 MAX 8, 9 and 10 as well as Airbus A321neos we expect to take delivery of next year.\nBringing into our fleet, the aircraft we have on order is critical to the success of United Next and to our ability to continue to bring meaningful improvements in both CASM-ex and fuel efficiency.\nTurning to balance sheet and cash. We ended the quarter with $20 billion in available liquidity. Our Treasurer, Pam Hendry, and I regularly discuss our optimal level of cash. Now, keep in mind, we have both been around the industry for a long time, so it is difficult for us to think in terms of too much cash.\nHowever, it is fair to say that as the recovery continues, you will see us reduce our cash as we begin the deleveraging journey. In fact, we started this journey in the first quarter as we elected to prepay an unsecured maturity, previously scheduled for repayment later this year, in addition to making our normally scheduled principal payments.\nThis resulted in our total debt declining by over $700 million during the quarter. Furthermore, in the first quarter, United produced $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations, driven largely by an over $2 billion increase in our advanced ticket liability. We're pleased that our operating cash generation is approaching 2019 levels as an additional indication of the recovery's progress.\nI want to close by reiterating our confidence in our 2023 and 2026 earnings targets. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted pretax margin of approximately 9% next year and continue to have confidence in our 2026 target of about 14%, representing profitability well above 2019 levels.\nAs we move into the second quarter, I want to thank my finance team for their dedication to remaining nimble and focused on our long-term goals. Our profitability outlook for both the second quarter and full year is a welcome milestone for all of us as we redouble our focus on United's path ahead.\nLooking even further ahead, since Scott mentioned my newborn grandson [Ezra], I can tell you that I am now more focused than ever to ensure that when Ezra grows up, he will recognize United as the airline people want to fly and where employees are proud to work and perhaps, most importantly, for his generation, the airline that has met all of its commitments to the environment.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it to Emily to start the Q&A.\n\nEmily Zanetis\n\nThanks, Gerry. We will now take questions from the analyst community. (Operator Instructions) Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question."

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with the Q&A. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nJ. Scott Kirby\n\nCEO & Director, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I get into the details of our fourth quarter and how we're thinking about the year ahead, I wanted to share some brief observations about the recent developments regarding the rollout of 5G. Mostly, I want to thank the White House Secretary Buttigieg and the CEOs of AT&T and Verizon for finding and agreeing to an approach that mostly avoided what would have been severe disruption to passenger and cargo operations in this country.\nThis wasn't an issue created by the airline. Every carrier follows the rules dictated by the FAA. Since we first heard from the FDA about this issue in November, United has been 100% engaged to underscore the severe risk with the 5G rollout close to aviation, but more importantly, to bring people together and drive consensus around common set solutions. And we -- while we don't have a final resolution quite yet, I'm confident we'll get there. This problem has been resolved collaborative -- can be -- has been resolved collaboratively, allowing a fulsome rollout of 5G without significant impact to aviation in 40 countries around the world, and we can do the same thing here in the United States.\nWhile I wish it happened earlier, the good news is we now have everyone engaged, the FAA and DOT at the highest levels, the equipment aircraft manufacturers, airlines and the telecoms. And I'm confident we'll soon have a clear set of objective criteria that allow full rollout of 5G without significant impact to aviation.\nI'll close this part of my comments by once again thanking the administration and Secretary Buttigieg, but also a particular thank you to the CEOs of AT&T and Verizon for voluntarily agreeing to these near-term restrictions near major airports.\nWith that, I'll turn to discussing our results and outlook. Over the last year, the United team persevered through the impact of COVID, but also made incredible progress laying the foundation for the future. Omicron is, once again, impacting the near term. But as we've done since March 2020, we're taking action on capacity, and we remain confident in the long-term projections in spite of the near-term headwinds from Omicron. But before we discuss our results and outlook, I want to take a minute to thank and brag about all that the people of United accomplished in 2021.\nIn spite of the historic challenges, United came together as a team to get through the worst crisis in the history of aviation and set ourselves up to be the world's leading airline on the other side. We saw our NPS improved by 30 points versus 2019 and introduced United Next to grow the airline and improve the product for customers. But we also made unique real and structural changes to our process and technology, which we believe is going to lead to best-in-class CASM-ex performance once we have the full fleet return to service.\nI think perhaps one of the least understood industry changes is that United is expecting to exit 2022 at a CASM-ex run rate below 2019, an expectation that sounds very different than most others in the industry. It is a transformational competitive change. So while we can't control the exact timing of course of COVID, we can improve the customer experience and control our costs. And that puts us in a completely different competitive position to outperform in the future.\nIn the short term, however, we're remaining responsive to the risk posed by the Omicron variant. Omicron is impacting demand in the near term, but the biggest impact of Omicron field surgeon COVID cases we've seen so far was on our people, and it led to a significant disruption in our operational performance over the holidays. As tough as this period has been, I'm particularly grateful that because of our vaccine requirement, we are no longer losing vaccinated employees to COVID, and we still don't have any vaccinated employees hospitalized. Our vaccine requirement has truly stabilized.\nAs we look to the remainder of 2022, Omicron is impacting near-term demand, and we're reducing our capacity as a result. But bookings continue to be strong for March and beyond, and our base case remains a continued recovery in demand, including international and business. Gerry and Andrew will give you more specifics on what we're changing this year on capacity. But the important point is we remain confident on the long-term CASM-ex target and future of United. We believe and certainly hope that as a company and society, we are moving into the endemic stage of COVID. But we'll continue to manage as we have throughout the crisis and once again this quarter and be responsive to what actually happens instead of what we hope will happen.\nI'll close by once again thanking the United team. They've done amazing things since the crisis began, and they've laid the foundation for United to be the world's leading airline going forward. And now I'll hand it over to Brett.\n\nBrett J. Hart\n\nPresident, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott. I'd like to start by thanking our employees for their hard work in the quarter. From the busiest travel season since the start of the pandemic, our team dealt with disruptions from weather events; changing international travel requirements; and most recently, the impact from the Omicron variant. With Omicron impacting both our employees and the rest of the country over the holidays, our team pulled together to serve our customers, and we are grateful to them.\nAs Scott mentioned, this latest variant has caused a delay in the expected recovery and having an impact on bookings in the first quarter. However, we remain confident that travel will rebound quickly as cases subside. We expect a strong summer and second half of 2022, consistent with our expectations pre-Omicron. While Andrew will outline the changes we've made in the near term on capacity in just a moment, we are confident and committed to our 2023 and 2026 financial targets. With our United Next network plans in mind, we look forward to hiring the next generation of United pilots.\nNext week, we'll host a grand opening of our United [A8] Academy in Goodyear, Arizona. We're excited about the role our world-class pilot training facility will play in recruiting and preparing the next generation of the United pilots. In fact, we welcomed the inaugural class in December, which consists of 30 students, 80% of whom are women or people of color. In the near term, we are making sure we are fully staffed as this is critical to executing our plan as the recovery takes hold.\nAs difficult as the holidays were, we are returning to a normalized operation. We've taken additional steps to ensure that disruptions are minimized for our customers through capacity management and incentives. Regarding the current labor environment, while we have small pockets of hiring challenges, those do not currently impact our ability to operate the main loan and are not impacting our capacity planning for 2022. We feel confident in our ability to achieve the level of hiring at United that supports the growth we are planning in the second half of 2022 and beyond.\nDespite Omicron's recent impact, we've achieved the highest-ever Net Promoter Score in our history, which is undoubtedly due to the team's service improvements and technological advancements that make flying with us easier than ever. A couple of examples.\nThis year, more than 760,000 customers have benefited from connection sales. And the percentage of customers that have misconnected in 2021 is the lowest since the merger. Our clubs in the U.S. are back, and we're ready for international travel to return as well, as this includes 6 Polaris lounges. We made it easier than ever to order onboard with our PayPal QR code. Also, our expanded beer, wine and snack offering is now available on nearly all flights over 2 hours.\nGerry will provide greater detail on our 2022 costs, but our 2022 budget incorporates the elevated inflationary pressures seen by the rest of the country and fully reflects the labor expense we expect to incur in the year. Importantly, the changes in our fleet and mix of flying would give us the confidence that we will reach CASM-ex below 2019 by the fourth quarter of this year, putting us on track to achieve our long-term cost goals in the United Next plan.\nWhile the macro environment delayed the recovery, we continued to act on additional initiatives towards our goal to become 100% green by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. United is now the largest airline to invest in zero-emission hydrogen electric engines for regional aircraft to a new equity stake in [Zero Avia], a leading company focused on hydrogen electric aviation solutions.\nWe also announced the second round of corporate participants in our Eco-Skies Alliance program. We believe each of these initiatives, among others, further solidifies United's position as the industry leader in sustainability.\nWith 2021 behind us, we're responding to the near-term volatility with areas of the business we can control, while continuing to invest in our people and products as we plan for our United Next plan that will transform the airline in the coming years.\nAnd with that, I will now turn it over to Andrew to discuss the [overall] environment.\n\nAndrew P. Nocella\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brett. Total revenue for the fourth quarter finished at the high end of our range and down 25% on 23% less capacity versus fourth quarter of '19. TRASM in the quarter finished down 2.5% versus the same period. We are pleased to reach the high end of our Q4 revenue guidance, but the Omicron variant did have around a 2-point negative impact on TRASM results and has delayed the anticipated demand and revenue recovery by a few months. Prior to Omicron, we were on track to deliver close to flat unit revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus -- or fourth quarter versus 2019.\nJust as in recent quarters, our cargo operation again delivered a record quarter for United. Total cargo revenue for the quarter was up 130% from the fourth quarter of '19 and finished the full year at $2.3 billion. Fourth quarter loyalty revenue and other revenue was up 3% in the third versus the fourth quarter of '19 to $518 million.\nNow turning to our first quarter outlook. Leisure bookings and demand for late February and March are largely on track with our expectations. However, Omicron disrupted close-in leisure demand in January across most regions, and cancellations did increase. Bookings and cancellations are now starting to return to normal. Business demand fell sharply in January versus early December. Given business demand tends to book closer to the travel, we remain optimistic that we'll see a strong rebound as we progress through the quarter, although that's clearly linked to the virus.\nOur revenue projections assume business demand rebounds by the end of February to where we were in early December [or] down approximately 40% versus the same period in 2019. Leisure demand trends that we've observed for travel later in the first quarter of 2022 have allowed us to manage our yield quality successfully versus our experience with the Delta variant surge. As a result, we remain optimistic that Omicron's impact, while significant, will be focused on January and February at this point. While we can't say if there will be additional widespread variants in the future, what we can say is that our expectation is that Omicron and each possible future variant will have a smaller and smaller impact on our revenue over time as compared to the impact of the Delta variant.\nWe now expect total revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to be down 20% to 25% versus 1Q '19, with capacity down between 16% and 18%. We have moderated our capacity plans in Q1, reflecting the anticipated lower demand in the near term as a result of Omicron. Lower capacity in Q1, along with a more conservative outlook, results in our latest full year 2022 plan having lower capacity than 2019. This is down from the 5% growth versus '19 we expected back in October.\nWe've moderated our 2022 capacity by lowering aircraft utilization and delaying the return to service to certain planes. Our ground is trapped with [the 777] jets are now expected to fly again [starting] in March and then gradually reenter service fully by November.\nWe've also delayed the return of service of certain narrow-body jets into the second half of 2022 and lowered the planned utilization levels of our regional jets for the remainder of the year, addressing pilot shortages. These changes, typical mainline aircraft -- these new changes typical mainline aircraft utilization is expected to be well below normal until Q4 of 2022. The phasing in of this idle capacity, particularly from larger jets and with lower utilization of RJs, will have a measurable impact on our gauge, ASM-ex and overall ASMs for each quarter of 2022, which Gerry will detail shortly.\nWe also continue to expect that our international long-haul line will enter a strong period of margin improvement versus the last cycle as we enter the second half of '22. We expect that new capacity to Africa, India and the Middle East will mostly offset lower capacity to Asia for the foreseeable future.\nWe continue to watch international demand carefully, but expect a recovery in close-in demand post-Omicron. The booking curve for the Atlantic proved shorter than usual in 2021, and we expect to have a same [record] performance for 2022. As of now, bookings for the Atlantic for the peak travel season are on track, and we've seen some relaxation in border controls to Israel and England.\nWe are working closely with our global partners as we build back our international network. And late last year, we announced a great new partnership with Virgin Australia. United is the leading U.S. carrier to Australia, and we believe this partnership will allow us to quickly and more profitably resume our flight schedule to Australia.\nWe're on track to create the best onboard products by introducing the United Signature interior. We've now taken delivery of 16 Sub-37 MAX [8s], which is interior. We're also making progress on our plan to modify the remainder of our narrow-body jets, so that by early '25, the entire mainline fleet will have this consistent exterior look and feel.\nOur future fleet will have an increased premium mix with premium seats per departure in North America up to 75% by 2026. It is worth noting that in the fourth quarter of '19, we've already started to produce new records and ancillary revenue generated by seat upgrades by our leisure customers. This trend to sell in more premium products to leisure customers represents a meaningful amount of potential upside to our United Next revenue plans and can also help cushion the impact of business traffic in the event it does fully return.\nAs several of our largest competitors have reduced the size of their business class cabin by about 10% on global long-haul flight, we expect that to continue. And as a result, there is a structural change that we see in the long-haul international service.\nLate in 2021, we are pleased to be right -- we were pleased to be recognized in the latest [BTN] survey completed by industry procurement leaders. These leaders clearly saw and rewarded our efforts to win their business, separating United and the bulk of the industry. We improved in every category, and we believe these results signify the hard work we're putting into women and ever increasing share of their corporate business, which again is a core component of our United Next Plan.\nThanks to the entire United team. And with that, I'll hand it off to Gerry to discuss our financial results and outlook.\n\nGerald Laderman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first call of the new year. While we all would have preferred to be further along in the recovery, you will see from our results for 2021 and forecast for this year that we continue to make great progress and are well positioned to achieve the long-term goals we have discussed with you since last June.\nTurning to the numbers. For the full year 2021, we reported a pretax loss of $2.6 billion and an adjusted pretax loss of $5.8 billion. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we reported pretax loss of $845 million and an adjusted pretax loss of $679 million. Our CASM-ex increased 13% on capacity down 23%, both versus the first -- fourth quarter of 2019. While CASM-ex was within our guidance range for the quarter, it was slightly higher than the midpoint as a result of Omicron-related expenses.\nLooking to the first quarter of 2022, there are 2 major factors impacting our CASM-ex. First, because of Omicron, as Andrew mentioned, we are adjusting capacity downwards to align with demand consistent with the agile pivoting we've done throughout the crisis. Secondly, we currently expect that our 52 Pratt-powered 777s will mostly remain grounded through the first quarter. This reduction in flying keeps our aircraft utilization down about 16% in the first quarter versus 2019 and does drive additional cost and efficiency.\nFirst quarter 2022 capacity is expected to be down between 16% and 18%, with CASM-ex expected to be up between 14% and 15% versus the first quarter of 2019. The math associated with flying fewer ASMs than originally expected, together with the added Omicron-related expense, is driving around 3 points of expected CASM-ex pressure in the quarter.\nBy the fourth quarter of 2022, however, our base case assumption is that we are past Omicron and flying schedule with capacity up around 5% versus fourth quarter 2019. In this scenario, our utilization would reach near 2019 levels and gauge up about 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 11 points versus the first quarter of this year, driven by the return of CASM-friendly 777s and the addition of 787s and larger 737 MAX aircraft. These factors, together with the full run rate benefit of our identified $2.2 billion in structural cost reductions, which we expect to achieve by this summer, were driving material change in our CASM-ex performance over the course of the year from up 14% to 15% in the first quarter to down around 2% in the fourth quarter of this year in each case compared to 2019.\nAs I mentioned, these figures represent our current base case assumption for our 2022 [fine]. But as Andrew outlined, we are committed to aligning our (inaudible), and we will continue to be flexible given the uncertainty around the pace of recovery. As a result of this uncertainty, we expect our CASM-ex results for the full year 2022 could fall anywhere in a range of scenarios.\nYou may recall, in October, we set our planned capacity for 2022 would be up around 5% versus 2019, with CASM-ex lower than 2019. Our outlook on CASM-ex remains consistent with this prior outlook, though, since we now expect our capacity for the year to be below 2019 levels, we must adjust our CASM-ex to take into account the impact of fixed costs spread over fewer ASMs.\nTo provide some further bookends, if capacity for the year were about flat to 2019, we expect our CASM-ex would be up 2% to 3% versus 2019. If full year 2022 capacity is 5% below 2019, we expect our CASM-ex will be up about 5% versus 2019. We believe our results will land between those figures on a full year basis. Most importantly, we expect CASM ex to improve throughout the year as our gauge and aircraft utilization materially improve in the second half and expect to end the year with CASM-ex below 2019 levels, as I noted earlier. Most importantly, the fourth quarter expected run rate for CASM-ex will put us well on track for our United Next cost plan for 2023 and beyond.\nTurning to fleet. We currently expect to take delivery of 53 737 MAX aircraft and 8 787 aircraft during the year. As we noted on our previous earnings calls, the 787 aircraft were originally expected to deliver in the first half of 2021. We now no longer expect to take the 787 aircraft until after the summer of 2022, contributing to about 1.5 points less capacity versus our original plan. Given this timing, we now expect our adjusted CapEx in 2022 to be around $4.2 billion, plus about $1.7 billion of adjusted CapEx that moved out of '21 into 2022 for a total of about [$1.9] billion for the full year.\nTo be clear, our total adjusted CapEx plan for the years 2021 and 2022 together have not changed since June of last year. There has simply been a timing shift driven by aircraft delivery delays. We continue to expect to use a mix of debt financing, leases and cash to fund the acquisition of new aircraft depending on market conditions while tracking towards our United Next leverage target.\nImportantly, (inaudible) over $20 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver, a strong cash position to continue to navigate the remainder of the crisis.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank my finance team as they have worked countless hours over the last 2 years to create and manage a flexible financial plan in response to a quickly evolving environment. We will continue to focus on appropriately managing our capacity and rebuilding our business back efficiently. We've observed that the impact of each variant on our business has decreased with each iteration. And we continue to expect COVID-19 to become endemic in the future. We remain confident in our 2023 [through] 2026 United Next financial target and our trajectory to maximize earnings power for the long term in the coming years.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it back to Kristina to start the Q&A."

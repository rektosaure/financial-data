My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oracle Corporation Q1, FY 2026 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Head of Investor Relations. Ken, please go ahead.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services, or went live on Oracle Cloud recently, will be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K, 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads. We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD, and many others. At the end of Q1, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, now top $455 billion. This is up 359% from last year and up $317 billion from the end of Q4. Our cloud RPO grew nearly 500% on top of 83% growth last year. Now to the results using constant currency growth rate. As you can see, we've made some changes to the face of our income statement to better reflect how we manage the business, and so you can understand our cloud business dynamics more directly. Here goes. Total cloud revenue, that's both apps and infrastructure, was up 27% to $7.2 billion.\nCloud infrastructure revenue was $3.3 billion, up 54% on top of the 46% growth reported in Q1 last year. OCI consumption revenue was up 57%, and demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply. Cloud database services, which were up 32%, now have annualized revenues of nearly $2.8 billion. Autonomous Database revenue was up 43% on top of the 26% growth reported in Q1 last year. Multi-cloud database revenue, where OCI regions are embedded in AWS, Azure, and GCP, grew 1,529% in Q1. Cloud application revenue was $3.8 billion, and up 10%, while our strategic back office application revenue was $2.4 billion, up 16%. Total software revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, down 2%. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, up 11% from last year, and higher than the 8% growth reported in Q1 last year. Operating income grew 7% to $6.2 billion.\nWe have also been on an accelerated journey to adopt AI internally to run more efficiently. I expect our operating income will grow mid-teens this year and higher still in FY 2027. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 in US dollars, while GAAP EPS was $1.01 in US dollars. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, which was higher than the 19% guidance and caused EPS to be $0.03 lower. For the last four quarters, operating cash flow was up 13% to $21.5 billion, and free cash flow was a negative $5.9 billion with $27.4 billion of CapEx. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $8.1 billion, while free cash flow was a negative $362 million with CapEx of $8.5 billion. At quarter end, we had $11 billion in cash and marketable securities, and short-term deferred revenue balance was $12 billion, up 5%.\nOver the last 10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 1/3 at an average price of $55, which is at this point much less than 1/4 of our current stock price. This quarter, we repurchased 440,000 shares for a total of $95 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $5 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. Given our RPO growth, I now expect fiscal year 2026 CapEx will be around $35 billion. As a reminder, the vast majority of our CapEx investments are for revenue-generating equipment that is going into the data centers, and not for land or buildings. As we bring more capacity online, we will convert the large RPO backlog into accelerating revenue and profit growth.\nNow, before I dive into specific Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some of the overarching thoughts on fiscal year 2026 and the coming years. Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build. I expect we will sign additional multi-billion dollar customers, and that RPO will likely grow to exceed half a trillion dollars. The enormity of this RPO growth enables us to make a large upward revision to the cloud infrastructure portion of our financial plan. We now expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year, and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the following four years. Much of this revenue is already booked in our $455 billion RPO number, and we are off to a fantastic start this year.\nNow, while much attention is focused on our GPU-related business, our non-GPU infrastructure business continues to grow much faster than our competitors. We are also seeing our industry-specific cloud applications drive customers to our back office cloud apps. Finally, the Oracle Database is booming with 34 multi-cloud data centers now live inside of Azure, GCP, and AWS, and we will deliver another 37 data centers for a total of 71. All these trends point to revenue growth going higher. For fiscal year 2026, we remain confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth of 16% in constant currency. Beyond fiscal year 2026, I'm even more confident in our ability to further accelerate our top and bottom line growth rate. As mentioned, we will provide an update on our long-range financial targets at our financial analyst meeting at Oracle AI World in Las Vegas in October.\nNow, let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis, assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a $0.03 positive impact on EPS and a 1% positive effect on revenue, depending on rounding. However, the actual currency impact may be different as it was in Q1. Here goes. Total revenues are expected to grow from 12% to 14% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 14% to 16% in US dollars at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 32% to 36% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 33% to 37% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% and 10% and be between $1.58 and $1.62 in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 10% to 12% and be between $1.61 and $1.65 in USD. Lastly, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary as they did this quarter. Larry, over to you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Safra. Eventually, AI will change everything. Right now, AI is fundamentally transforming Oracle and the rest of the computer industry, though not everyone fully grasps the extent of the tsunami that is approaching. Look at our quarterly numbers. Some things are undeniably evident. Several world-class AI companies have chosen Oracle to build large-scale GPU-centric data centers to train their AI models. That's because Oracle builds gigawatt-scale data centers that are faster and more cost-efficient at training AI models than anyone else in the world. Training AI models is a gigantic multi-trillion dollar market. It's hard to conceive of a technology market as large as that one. If you look close, you can find one that's even larger. It's the market for AI inferencing. Millions of customers using those AI models to run businesses and governments.\nIn fact, the AI inferencing market will be much, much larger than the AI training market. AI inferencing will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug design, interpreting medical diagnostic images and laboratory results, automating laboratories, placing bets in financial markets, automating legal processes, automating financial processes, automating sales processes. AI is going to write, that is, generate the computer programs called AI agents that will automate your sales and marketing processes. Let me repeat that. AI is going to automatically write the computer programs that will then automate your sales processes and your legal processes and everything else, and your factories, and so on. Think about it. AI inferencing. It's AI inferencing that will change everything. Oracle is aggressively pursuing the AI, and we're not doing badly in the AI training market, by the way. Inferencing's bigger.\nOracle is aggressively pursuing the inferencing market as well as the AI training market. We think we are in a pretty good position to be a winner in the inferencing market because Oracle is by far the world's largest custodian of high-value private enterprise data. With the introduction of our new AI database, we added a very important new way for you to store your data in our database. You can vectorize it. By vectorizing it, by vectorizing all your data, all your data can be understood by AI models. We made it very easy for our customers to directly connect all their databases, all their new Oracle AI databases, and cloud storage, OCI Cloud Storage, to the world's most advanced AI reasoning models, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Llama, all of which are uniquely available in the Oracle Cloud.\nAfter you vectorize your data and link it to an LLM, the LLM of your choice, you can then ask any question you can think of. For example, how will the latest tariffs impact next quarter's revenue and profit? You ask that question, the large language model will then apply advanced reasoning to the combination of your private enterprise data, plus publicly available data. You get answers to important questions without ever compromising the safety and security of your private data. Again, I'd like you to think about this for a moment. A lot of companies are saying, we're big into AI because we're writing agents. Well, guess what? We're writing a bunch of agents too. When they introduced ChatGPT almost three years ago, what you got to do is have a conversation and ask questions. You weren't automating some process with an agent.\nYou could ask whatever question you wanted to ask and get a well-reasoned answer with all of the latest and best information, and high-quality reasoning going along with it. Who's offering that to customers? We'll be the first when we deliver it and demonstrate it at AI World next month. That's what our customers have been asking for ever since the introduction of ChatGPT 3.5 almost three years ago. I want to ask questions about anything. Therefore, you need to understand my enterprise data as well as all the publicly available data. Then you can answer the questions that are most important to me. Well, now they can ask those questions. Back to you, Safra.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Larry. Tiffany, please pull the audience for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, simply press star one again. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you for taking my question. Listen, even I am sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward. This question, I guess, is sort of purposely open-ended. Larry and Safra, Oracle's become the de facto standard for AI training workloads, and you make money at it, and I have a lot of faith in that. Clearly, there's more here than just AI training. I know it's a big part of it. You talked about it. Can you talk about what else, a little more detail about what else is driving these pretty amazing forecasts?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nGo ahead, Larry.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah, I mean.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYou were just covering this.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, a lot of people are looking for inferencing capacity. I mean, people are running out of inferencing capacity. I mean, the company that called us, I mentioned it, I think either last quarter or the quarter before, someone called us, we'll take all the capacity you have that's currently not being used anywhere in the world. We don't care. I'd never gotten a call like that. That's a very unusual call. That was for inferencing, not training. There's a huge amount of demand for inferencing. If you think about it, in the end, all this money we're spending on training is going to have to be translated into products that are sold, which is all inferencing. The inferencing market, again, is much larger than the training market. Yes, we are building, like everybody else, we're building agents with our applications.\nWe're doing much more than that. You know, no one's shown me a ChatGPT 3.5, again, three years ago, three and a half, three years ago, a little less than three years ago, when ChatGPT amazed the world. You could simply talk to your computer and ask questions and get well-reasoned questions based on the latest and most precise information, as long as you ask those questions about publicly available data. There's a lot of publicly available data. If you combine the publicly available data with the enterprise data, which companies really don't want to share, you have to do it in such a way that your private enterprise data stays private, yet the large language model can still use it for reasoning.\nAs to answer your question, like, how do the latest tariffs or the latest steel prices or whatever affect my quarterly results, affect my ability to deliver products, affect my revenue, affect my costs? You know, answer those kinds of questions. To answer those kinds of questions, we have to, and we have, we had to change our database, fundamentally change our database so you can vectorize all data. That's the form in which large language models understand information exactly after it's been vectorized, and then allowing people to ask any question they want about anything. That's exactly what we've done.\nUnless you have a database that is secure and reliable and linked to all of the popular LLMs, and we've done all of that, unless you have that, and you have to tell me who else has that besides Oracle, unless you have that, it's going to be very hard for you to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience on top of your data as well as publicly available data. That's a unique value proposition for Oracle. That's because, again, we're the custodian of much more data than any of the application companies. They have their application data. They measure their customers in tens of thousands. We measure our customers in millions of databases. We think we're better positioned than anybody to take advantage of inferencing.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nWell, that all.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nIn addition, by the way, aside from just our GPU and all of that, we have become the de facto cloud for many of our customers. Again, they want to put some things in our public cloud or in our competitor's public cloud working with the Oracle Database. Simultaneously, there are a lot of reasons why they want what's called either a dedicated region or Cloud@Customer. We give our customers so much choice that it's very unusual for us not to be able to meet a customer's needs in one way or another. Of course, we have every piece of the stack. We have the infrastructure, and we have the database that you're going to hear a lot about as really the only reasonable store for data that you want to use AI models against.\nWe have all of these applications that are just taking off. We just have a lot of different layers. They're all moving in the same direction, and they all benefit our customers when used together.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nListen, my hats off.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLarry, let me just.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGo ahead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nGo ahead, John.\nJohn, maybe you were going to compliment us, and I interrupted you. I'm sorry, I apologize for being rude.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nListen, I was just going to say my hats off to both of you. I have been doing this a really long time, and I tell my whole team, pay attention to this, even those that are not working on Oracle, because this is a career event happening right now. It looks, it's just amazing. I guess I'm just really happy for you, and congrats on this. It's amazing.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nA lot of work.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nYou too. Keep doing it.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nIt's been a lot of work. Let me mention two other things I think that are actually shocking. We have gotten the entire Oracle Cloud, the whole thing, every feature, every function of the Oracle Cloud, down to something we can put into a handful of racks, three racks. We call it Butterfly. It costs $6 million. We can give you a private version of the Oracle Cloud with every feature, every security feature, every function, everything we do for $6 million. I think the cost for the other hyperscalers is more than 100 times that. We can actually give our customers, clouded customers, the full clouded customer. We have companies like Vodafone. I'm not sure which companies I can name and which companies I can't.\nWe have large companies that are buying basically their own Oracle Cloud regions, in fact, multiple Oracle Cloud regions, because they don't want to have any neighbors in their cloud. They don't want other companies in their cloud. They want the full cloud. They want to pay as they consume. They want all the features, all the functions, all the safety, the security. They don't want to have to buy it. They want us to buy and own the software and the hardware. They want us to maintain it, build the networks, supply all of that, and they just want to pay for consumption. We can do that at an entry-level price that's 1% of what our competitors can offer. That's one thing. Another thing. Let me give you one more, and I'll stop there. We also have the most advanced application generator of any company. It's interesting.\nWe're an application company and a cloud infrastructure company. Therefore, we build applications. As we build applications, we'd like to be more efficient. The way to be more efficient is to build AI application generators, and we have been doing that. The latest applications that we are building, we're not building them. They're being generated by AI. We think we're far, far ahead of any of the other application companies in terms of generating the applications. That's another very significant advantage we have. Of course, and it's funny, you know, I made the comment, we don't charge separately for our AI and our applications because our applications are AI. They're entirely AI, the new ones, the new ones that we're building. They're nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow. That's all they are.\nHow do you charge separately for that? That's every application that we have. The applications are better, and hopefully, we'll sell more. That's the way we'll get paid for them. I got it. Thank you, John, for the very nice compliment.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you, Larry. Thank you, Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, John, for all these years following us so kindly also. Thanks. Great day. Probably time for another question at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. I think we're all kind of in shock in a very, very good way. Larry, there's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing than these results that you just put up. Oracle has a near 50-year track record of navigating transitions and coming out on top. As we think about enterprise applications, investors are fairly pessimistic these days. I'd love to hear your perspective. Where do you see this all going for the industry? Where does the market share go for the companies that don't have the database, that don't have the advantages that you have all the way down to the silicons? Is this maybe an extinction event? Be curious to hear what you think.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, I think we have substantial advantages because we are an infrastructure company, and we are an application company. There are two things that happen. As an application company, we knew we had to start generating our applications. We just couldn't do it with armies of people anymore. We still need people, don't get me wrong, but the number of people we need is substantially less. We can build/generate much better applications than we can hand-build. We've been working on these AI application generators for some time, and we're actually using them. The thing is, we're not just building application generators. We're building application generators, and then we're building the applications, which gives us insights to make the application generator better.\nIt's a huge advantage to be on both sides of that equation, both being an application builder and a builder of the application generation technology, the underlying AI application code generators. That's a huge advantage. Let me give you another advantage, which is often a disadvantage. We're very large. We no longer sell individual discrete applications. We sell suites of applications. We decided to go into the medical business against Epic, believing that we could solve much more of the problem because we're much bigger than they are. By the way, we're much bigger than Workday or ServiceNow, and we're solving a larger portion of the problem. We're able to do all of ERP, then we can add all of CRM. All the pieces are engineered to fit together. That makes it so much easier for customers to consume.\nWe think that being good at application generation, the underlying technology, makes us build better applications, enables us to build more applications, so we can solve more of the problem. The customers do not have to do all that system integration across multiple vendors. We can just build a suite where all the pieces are engineered to fit together. I think we have tremendous advantages in the application space. We have tremendous advantages in the AI inferencing space where we can, again, what we will demonstrate at Oracle AI World next month is we have taken all of our customer data, all of it. I want to go into all the details now. You can ask any question you want to ask. Who is your salesperson? Who is the number one prospect in my territory? What product should I be selling them next?\nWhat are the best references for me to use, persuade them to use our product? You can get all of those questions answered for you immediately if you're a salesperson. The engineers can look at which features of Oracle Financials are people making the most errors when they're using those features that I have to fix and make easier to use. You just asked the question because all of that data is available to AI models. Is there anyone else doing this? Not that I know of. It's a huge advantage.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nAmazing day. Thank you. Looking forward to AI World, Larry. Thank you. It's an amazing day for Oracle. It's a remarkable day for the industry. Thanks again, and congrats.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I'll echo my congratulations on this momentous quarter. Safra, I mean, the fact that you delivered over $300 billion in new RPO in Q1, just really amazing to see. It's going to require a lot of infrastructure build-out. Could you provide a bit more context on how much CapEx and operational cost structure will be needed to fully service these contracts, how we should think about the ramp of these costs relative to the ramp in revenue over the next few years, and generally how investors should be thinking about the ROI on this spend?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nSure. First of all, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and as I've said very clearly beforehand, we do not own the property. We do not own the buildings. What we do own and what we engineer is the equipment. That's equipment that is optimized for the Oracle Cloud. It has extremely special networking capabilities. It has technical capabilities from Larry and his team that allows us to run these workloads much, much faster. As a result, it's much cheaper than our competitors, depending on the workload. Now, because of that, what we do is we put in that equipment only when it's time. Usually very quickly, assuming that our customer accepts it, we're already generating revenue right away. The faster they accept the system and that it meets their needs, the faster they start using it, the sooner we have revenue.\nThis is, in some ways, I don't want to call it asset light from the finance world, but it's asset pretty light. That is really an advantage for us. I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings. That's not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage, just the whole way we put these systems together. By the way, they are identical and very simplified. Again, making it possible for us to be very profitable while still being able to offer our customers an incredibly compelling price. What I have indicated is that CapEx looks like it's going to be about $35 billion for this fiscal year. Because we're monitoring this, we're literally putting it in right when we take possession and then handing it over to generate revenue right away.\nWe have a very good line of sight for our capabilities to put this out and basically to just spend on that CapEx right before it starts generating revenue. At this point, I'm looking at $35 billion for the year. I think it could be a little higher, but I think if it is higher, it's good news because it means more capacity has been handed over to me in terms of floor space. As you also know, we are embedded in our competitors' clouds. Again, all we are responsible for to pay for is, in fact, our equipment. That goes right away. There, we're moving ultimately to 71 data centers embedded in our competitors or partners.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLet me add a couple of very short things. One is we just turned over a giant data hall to one of our customers. The acceptance time could have been as long as a couple of months. It was one week. It was one week from the time we officially owned the equipment, and they were testing it to the time they started paying for it. One week. We have an extraordinary team that's doing an extraordinary job of making sure that we get the equipment working very quickly. Our customer can accept it. They want to accept it as fast as possible because they want to do the work. They want to train their models. This one took a huge hall, took one week for acceptance. It was extraordinary event. We are a very large consumer of networking equipment, GPUs, etc.\nBecause we are a very large consumer, we are able, I think, to get better financing terms from the vendors than some other people. I think we have that going for us as well. I think we're going to do very well on the finance side. We have advantages there as well.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOf course.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much, Larry and Safra, and frankly, team Oracle, amazing and congratulations. I'd like to focus on the AI training business you've been winning. Could you please explain to us how Oracle can create enough of a differentiated moat to assure this business does not get commoditized? How do you continue to drive strong earnings and free cash flow from the training business, even if training slows? I think people really need to understand that.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, I mean, I can do it with one sentence. Our networks move data very, very fast. If we can move data faster than the other people, if we have advantages in our GPU super clusters that are performance advantages, if you're paying by the hour, if we're twice as fast, we're half the cost.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nWell, that's tight.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nHard to beat that.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nImpressive.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI agree. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. I really appreciate you squeezing me in. I originally was going to ask you if the new Oracle AI Database really opens up the general enterprise inferencing market. Based on your script, it sounds like the answer to that question is hell yes. I guess my follow-up question would be, how do you see that pacing happening over the course of the next few years? How soon after the introduction of the Oracle AI Database would you expect your enterprise customers, your sophisticated customers, to really be open to interrogating their enterprise data in this fashion? How does the current supply constraint environment stand in the way of that demand, or is it solving as we speak?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nI don't know if Larry, you want to cover it. You covered it in the script.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nNo, we're good.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nGo ahead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah, you good. Go ahead. Okay. I think who wouldn't want that? I mean, I think everyone says they want to use AI. I mean, CEOs say they want to use AI. Heads of state, heads of government say they want to use AI. We've never had consumers like that. I mean, historically, we don't deal with CEOs. Now we deal with CEOs. Now we deal with heads of government and heads of state on this because AI is so important. Letting people use AI on top of their data, that is what they want to do. They didn't know how to do it securely. They didn't know how to, well, they didn't know how to do it, period. One of the big risks was, oh my God, I can't share my JPMorgan Chase can't share all of its data.\nGoldman Sachs can't share all of its data with OpenAI. They won't do it. Or xAI, or Llama, or Meta. It's got to keep it private. We've got to keep your private data private. We've got to keep your private data secure. We have to make it available for inferencing by the latest and best reasoning models from OpenAI, xAI, and everyone else. Because we have the database, because we can vectorize all the data in the database, because we have very elaborate security models in our database, in the Oracle Database, we can do all that. We can deliver all that. What we chose to do with the AI database was not only make sure we can vectorize all the data so it can be understood by the AI model, we then bundled it with all of the AI models.\nThat's why we did a deal with Google. That's why we did all of these deals where Gemini, you can get Gemini from the Oracle Cloud. You can get Grok from the Oracle Cloud. You can get ChatGPT from the Oracle Cloud. You get Llama from the Oracle Cloud. I could go on. We bundled them together, so it's very easy for our customers to use these large language models on a combination. That's what they want. It's a combination of all of the publicly available data, and all of their enterprise data, which allows them to ask and get answered any question they can think of, any question that's important to them. Everyone wants it. I think the demand is going to be insatiable. We can deliver a lot of databases and a lot of AI across our cloud over the next several years.\nWe're in a good position to do that.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThis is going to be one of the reasons that Oracle Databases, which are still the bulk of the enterprise market by a lot, are going to finally move into the cloud. Many of them will move in the public cloud using the Oracle AI Database. Many and the largest enterprises will want their own either dedicated regions or Oracle Cloud@Customer. Again, they can finally get the benefit of AI for their own data using any LLM that they want, because they're all in our cloud too.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nIt sounds like very high margin AI revenue, guys. Congratulations.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you. Thank you. Okay.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Alex. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Tiffany for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, please press star one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our investor relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz.\nAs a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today.\nAs a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K, 10-Q, and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks, and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had an excellent fourth quarter to finish out an amazing year, with Q4 total revenue and EPS both exceeding my guidance. We are reporting our fiscal year-end results just 11 days after the last day of the quarter. Using Oracle Fusion, we continue to announce our quarterly and annual financial results faster than any other company in the S&P 500. A few years ago, I told you that we'd reached a tipping point in our cloud transition and expected revenue growth to accelerate, and it has. In Q4, we hit double-digit revenue growth, and it's only going up from here, even as the company gets bigger.\nOur remaining performance obligations now stand at $138 billion, up $8 billion from last quarter, and up 41% from last year, and yet the best is still to come. Our applications business was the first area we moved to the cloud more than a decade ago, and we are now the leader in enterprise back office with SaaS solutions for ERP, financials, EPM, HCM, supply chain, and manufacturing, with the addition of over 100 AI agents, along with strong bookings and higher renewal rates for our strategic SaaS products. I expect the cloud applications growth rate will accelerate this coming year. Our infrastructure business was the next area to move to the cloud.\nWe made engineering decisions that were much different from the other hyperscalers, and that were better suited to the needs of enterprise customers, resulting in lower costs to them and giving them deployment flexibility. OCI has seen exceptional demand for infrastructure services, and those contracted non-cancelable bookings in RPO give us confidence that OCI revenue will grow over 70% this current year. Included in that is the Oracle Autonomous Database and the AI Data Platform. Enterprises know that their AI needs demand the most capable database to manage a company's full data set.\nFurther, with our AI and autonomous features, our customers can bring all their data together, make it available for LLMs, and yet have the best security built in. In addition, our customers have the flexibility to run their Oracle databases in OCI, in private clouds, or in partner clouds with our multi-cloud offering. What is clear is that more customers will use the Oracle database to leverage AI. As a result of the strength in our cloud applications and infrastructure, including database services, we are raising our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2026 to over $67 billion, up 16% for the year.\nNow, to the results, and as usual, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rates, as it is how we manage the business. Total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS, was up 27% at $6.7 billion, and total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $11.7 billion, up 14%. IaaS revenue was $3 billion, up 52% on top of the 42% growth reported last year. OCI consumption revenue was up 62%, and demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply. Our infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of nearly $12 billion. Cloud database services, which were up 31%, now have annualized revenue of $2.6 billion.\nAutonomous database consumption revenue was up 47% on top of the 27% growth reported last year. As on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, either on OCI directly or through our database at cloud services with Azure, Google, or AWS, we expect that cloud database revenues collectively will be the third driver of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic SaaS. We are currently live in 23 cloud regions with database at cloud services and have another 47 planned. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support, were up 7%. Infrastructure subscription revenues in the quarter, which includes license support, were $6.7 billion, up 19%.\nSaaS revenue was $3.7 billion, up 11%. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $5 billion, up 8%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have annualized revenues of $9.3 billion, and they were up 20%. Software license revenues were up 8% to $2 billion. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $15.9 billion, up 11% from last year. Operating income grew 7%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.70 in US dollars, while GAAP EPS was $1.19 in US dollars. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 9.7%, higher than my 19.7%, which was higher than my 19% guidance. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $57.4 billion, up 9%.\nTotal cloud services and license support revenue, which is entirely subscription-based and accounts for 77% of total revenue, was $44 billion, up 12%. Total application subscription revenue grew 7%, and infrastructure subscription revenues grew 17%. Total cloud services were up 24% to $24.5 billion. IaaS, or cloud infrastructure revenue, was up 51% to $10.2 billion for the quarter, with consumption revenue up 59% from last year. SaaS revenue was up 10% to $14.3 billion for the year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $6 in USD, up 9%, and the full year operating income grew 9%.\nAs mentioned, remaining performance obligation at the end of Q4 is now $138 billion, up 41% in USD. Further, our cloud RPO grew 56% on top of the 80% growth last year, and now represents nearly 80% of total RPO. Approximately 33% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. For the year, operating cash flow was up 12% at $20.8 billion, and free cash flow was a negative $400 million, with $21.2 billion of CapEx. Operating cash flow for Q4 was $6.2 billion, while free cash flow was a negative $2.9 billion, with CapEx of $9.1 billion.\nThe vast majority of our CapEx investments are for revenue-generating equipment that is going into data centers and not for land or buildings. I expect that FY26 CapEx will be higher at over $25 billion as we work to meet demand from our backlog. As we bring more capacity online, our revenue and profit growth will further accelerate. At quarter end, we had $11.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $9.4 billion. We are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend.\nThis quarter, we repurchased a little over a million shares for a total of $150 million, and over the last 10 years, we've reduced shares outstanding by more than a third at an average share price of just over $54. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $4.7 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. Since it's the beginning of FY26, I'd like to comment on the financial acceleration we expect to see in the coming years. Between our $138 billion RPO and even larger pipeline, we have a clear line of sight to future revenue growth.\nFor fiscal year 2026, I expect that total cloud revenue will grow over 40% in constant currency, up from 24% in FY25. I expect that cloud infrastructure revenue will grow over 70%, up from 51% in FY25. I expect total revenue will be at least $67 billion, up 16% in constant currency, and up more than a billion from our prior guidance. RPO is likely to grow more than 100% in fiscal year 2026. Lastly, I expect we will exceed the revenue growth target we previously provided for FY27. Beyond FY27, I am even more confident in our ability to meet, and likely exceed, our previously provided FY29 targets.\nWe will provide a more fulsome update on our long-range financial targets at the financial analyst meeting at Oracle CloudWorld in Las Vegas in October. Now, let me turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. Now, assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 2% positive effect on EPS, and a flat to 1% positive effect on revenue, depending on rounding. However, of course, the actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues are expected to grow from 11% to 13 in constant currency, and are expected to grow from 12% to 14 in US dollars.\nTotal cloud revenue is expected to grow from 26% to 30 in constant currency and US dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% and 6 and be between $1.44 and $1.48 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 5% to 7 and be between $1.46 and $1.50 in USD. Lastly, my EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. We had a great year, and this year, the one we're in now, will be better. Oracle is well on its way to being not only the world's largest cloud application company, but also one of the world's largest cloud infrastructure companies.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nThank you, Safra. Oracle's future is bright in this new era of cloud computing. Oracle will be the number one cloud database company. Oracle will be the number one cloud applications company. Oracle will be the number one builder and operator of cloud infrastructure data centers. We will build and operate more cloud infrastructure data centers than all of our cloud infrastructure competitors combined. First, database. Most of the world's most valuable data is stored in an Oracle database. All of those databases are moving to the cloud: Oracle's cloud, Microsoft's Azure cloud, Amazon's cloud, or Google's cloud. Oracle runs everywhere.\nThe latest vector version of the Oracle database, Oracle 23ai, is an AI data platform, the only database that can make all of the customer's data immediately available to all of the popular AI large language models, while maintaining complete data privacy for the customer. As use of AI increases, so will Oracle's database market share. Oracle will be the largest and most profitable cloud applications company in the world. Oracle develops suites of integrated AI agent-based applications for ERP, for EPM, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, and customer engagement, plus industry applications for healthcare, banking, utilities, retail, hospitality, and many other industries.\nWe use the most modern application generators and AI database technology to build our application suite. We add AI analytics using OpenAI, xAI, Google, Llama, and other popular LLMs on top of that application data. No other company is even attempting to build the depth and breadth of AI-based applications that we have already built. Oracle will build more cloud infrastructure data centers than all of our infrastructure competitors combined. All of our OCI data centers, from the smallest low-cost data center to the largest gigawatt AI training data center, include all Oracle OCI capabilities.\nA large percentage of those capabilities are autonomous, so labor costs are minimized, and human error is dramatically reduced. Oracle is already prospering in this new era of cloud computing and AI, and it's just the beginning. Back to you, Safra. Thank you, Larry. Before we go to the Q&A, just to repeat one number: FY25 cloud infrastructure revenue was up 51% to $10.2 billion for the year, with consumption revenue up 59% from last year. Sarah, if you could please pull the audience for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. Please ensure that your phone is not on mute when called upon. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Your first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior VP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much for taking my question, Larry, Safra, and the whole Oracle family. Congratulations on the strong quarter and the strong year. You've been promising and are now starting to deliver, excuse me, and are now starting to deliver extraordinary growth acceleration, something we've not seen at other very large software companies. Yet there's a lack of understanding across the street of your AI business. Can you give us color or break out any numbers to help investors understand the durability and profitability of the AI business? Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nWell, the interesting thing is a lot of people are talking about that they have all the data. These other companies say they have all the data, so they can do AI really well. They can build all these AI agents on top of all of that data. The only problem with that statement is they don't have all the data we do. We have most of the world's valuable data. The vast majority of it is in an Oracle database. The latest version of the Oracle database is an AI-centric piece of technology, a vector database called Oracle 23ai. What it does is it's the key enabler for companies to use AI. I mean, the current AI models are trained on the internet, otherwise known as publicly available data.\nDo you think JPMorgan Chase makes all of their internal data publicly available? Do you think those AI models train on JPMorgan Chase's data? Companies want to be able to use AI models on top of their own data. That is essential. Oracle applications make all of the data inside the Oracle applications available to AI models like Grok, ChatGPT, or, by the way, all the rest of them, from Google, from whomever, from Meta, Llama, all of us. We have all of those LLMs in our cloud or in the Oracle Cloud. This is our value proposition. Our database takes all of your data, and our applications take all of your application data and make that data available to the most popular AI models.\nIf you like ChatGPT, you use ChatGPT. If you like Grok, you use Grok. You use that in the Oracle Cloud. We are the key enabler for enterprises to use their own data and AI models. No one else is doing that.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior VP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nThis is not a small point. This is why our database business is going to grow dramatically. Think about it. You have to put all of your data into a database. That database must be highly secure, scalable, economical, and reliable 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. It has to be fault-tolerant. It can never break. That is how Oracle got popular in the first place. It has to hold the data in a way that is consumable by the AI models. In other words, the data has to be vectorized and searchable by the AI models. You use that data to train up those models on your data. Who else is doing that?\nLet me answer the question. Nobody.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you. Hi, Larry and Safra. Safra, your quote in that press release that you repeated on this call about next year was, I do not know, pretty amazing and as strong a statement as I have seen you make. I have known you a long time. Putting that in print means a lot to me because I know it means a lot to you. Can you help us unpack that statement a bit? For instance, is Stargate part of the more than 70% growth you expect in IaaS and fiscal 2026? We do not know the timing of Stargate or even your financial share. We know there are big numbers out there, but not how much of it is yours or you are going to be involved. Is Stargate also in the RPO growth of more than 100% in fiscal 2026?\nAny other color beyond Stargate to help us get our heads around those massive growth numbers for IaaS would be helpful.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThanks, John. Yeah, we have known each other a very long time, longer than I am sure you would admit. The reality is that Stargate is still in formation. There are a lot of partnerships we are in the middle of right now that are all part of this enormous growth rate. We are the destination for everyone who wants AI workloads, who want database workloads, and want applications. All of that together comes into our RPO. We have so much in pipeline right now. We have so much in RPO, meaning those are non-cancelable contracts. We see the demand. I am still in a position where our supply is not meeting our demands.\nWe actually currently are still waiving off customers or scheduling them out into the future so that we have enough supply to meet demand. This is a situation that we have not seen in our history. The numbers themselves are so enormous. The reason is because our technology is different. As Larry has said on previous calls, the cloud we built runs faster and has more capabilities than our competitors that are built for enormous amounts of data. We are very much the destination of choice. As Stargate forms, that will contribute into all of this. Some of our partners, many of our partners, some of them will be in Stargate. Some are outside of Stargate.\nWe really are working with many, many companies right now and have enormous pipeline as a result.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nLet me give you a couple of—let me chime in here also a little bit. Let me surprise you with—there are huge contracts that have nothing to do with even AI. We got a gigantic contract from Temu that would have been unprecedented, except for all the other gigantic contracts we've also been getting. Temu is a very large company that's growing extremely rapidly. They're basically moving their infrastructure to the Oracle Cloud. That was a very big contract. We're seeing huge growth in multi-cloud from the data centers we've already built and the data—I mean, if it's revenue, it's obviously data centers we've already built. The future, the growth rate in multi-cloud is astonishing.\nIn other words, our database is now moving very rapidly to the cloud, I think because a few reasons. The database has now all these AI capabilities, but also, quite frankly, now people can get it in whatever cloud they want. If you're dedicated to using Microsoft Azure, you can get the Oracle Database in Microsoft Azure. The fully capable Oracle Database in Microsoft Azure with all of our fanciest features, including the new AI features. You can get it at Google. You can get it at Amazon. You can get it at the Oracle Cloud. It's all the same in every place.\nThat's given our customers a lot of comfort that Oracle is not only where they store all of their current data, but they want to keep using the Oracle Database, expand their use of the Oracle Database, and move all of that data to the cloud as quickly as they can. They're now able to do it at the cloud of their choosing. The database business is growing rapidly. This next generation of companies like ByteDance, TikTok, which obviously we do business with them, Temu, and others, I mean, there are just lots of these companies. A bunch of the security companies have moved to the Oracle Cloud. It's growth coming from many, many different directions.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nIf I could just—Stargate is just part of it. There are a lot of things happening here. I just wanted to clarify, it sounds like it's part of RPO, but is it also part of that 70% in IaaS revenue growth too?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nWell.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nYeah. Of course. I mean.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nGo ahead, Sarah. Go ahead.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nStargate is not formed yet, but some of our business with OpenAI, which is one of our partners in Stargate, is part of our future, very much so. Got it. Do you understand? We work with OpenAI. Those are still small numbers in the scheme of everything else we're doing, but it will ultimately be bigger.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you very much, and great job.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nOkay. Next question, please.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nLet me add one little thing. If Stargate turns out to be everything as advertised, then we've understated our RPO growth.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nCorrect.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks, Safra and Larry. Great to be speaking with you today. Nice presentation. Your CapEx in the quarter was much higher than expected. I mean, $5 billion more than we expected to get to the $21 billion. Now you're thinking about it going to $25 billion. Just wanted a little more color on what it was spent on. How is it helping you yield more revenue? How do you know $25 billion is the right number for this year? Larry, you usually have some pretty good color on architecture when you answer this question. I'm looking forward to that as well.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nOkay. Let me start and let Larry make it perfect. The reality is that, as I mentioned on the call, our CapEx is usually about equipment. We have building partners who charge us rent once they've finished constructing things. When we all of a sudden have higher CapEx, it means we are filling out data centers, and we are buying components to build our computers, which are different than other people's, and we are putting them on the floor. We had an opportunity to buy up and for deployment, and we did. We are putting out as much capacity as we possibly can as quickly as we can. I do believe that the $25 billion next year may turn out to be understated. It is all to meet demand.\nWe don't order, we don't build unless we've got orders for our capacity to be built out. We have so much in orders right now that I actually expect—I believe I said on the call—over $25 billion this next quarter. That is, again, to match demand.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nLet me add, we recently got an order that said, we'll take all the capacity you have wherever it is. This could be in Europe, it could be in Asia, we'll just take everything. I mean, we never got an order like that before. We had to move things around. We did the best we could to give them the capacity they needed. The demand is astronomical. Now, we have to do this methodically. The reason demand continues to outstrip supply is we can only build these data centers, build these computers so fast. We're also doing a lot of engineering around high-speed networking.\nYou'll see us making large engineering investments to speed up the networking, the reliability of the networking, and lower the cost of the networking. We're doing a bunch of things to lower our CapEx costs. Even if we do that, CapEx is going to go up because the demand right now seems almost insatiable. I mean, I don't know how to describe it. I've never seen anything remotely like this. Thanks a lot, Larry. Appreciate it. I mean, people are calling up and asking us, please, can you find us more capacity? We'll take it wherever. Oh, it's in Malaysia. We'll take it there. Fine. We'll take it there. You got somewhere? Wherever.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nAre you having any trouble getting GPUs?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nNo.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nNo. Not right now. No.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nGot it. Thanks for so much color, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks. Congratulations and a strong Q4, and impressive guidance.\nI want to go back to the cloud database. Mainly, you have massive database and on-prem. What are you hearing from customers in terms of migrating to cloud? Now you have multi-cloud strategy. You have dedicated Alloy customer. Safra, what's your expectation on the cloud database revenue contribution or driving that 70% growth of OCI in fiscal 2026?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nOkay. Let me just start. First of all, the database business is really healthy, really growing. In fact, you even see it in the number that I think folks didn't think was possible, which is in license. You should understand that when our customers are buying more licenses, that actually means often that they want to use the bring-your-own-license pricing to go to the cloud. Database support is up, is solid, license is up, all the cloud metrics, autonomous consumption, Oracle Cloud, all of multi-cloud is basically using up all capacity that gets put out there. The Oracle Database is on fire, and it is only the beginning.\nI want to remind you what a significant and large business it is, and the bulk of it is still on-premise. As Larry said, now that you can have it in any of the clouds you like, with the database at Oracle, in all the other clouds, also beyond just OCI, or you can deploy it at Cloud@Customer, another place where the numbers are enormous in growth rate. Consumption going way up, more licensing, more bookings, and a lot of demand. The database side of the world, for all the reasons Larry said, is just a superb business and extremely compelling, especially to the extent you want to leverage artificial intelligence.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nYou asked for a number, an easy number to figure out. Let's say $10 billion of our support revenue, our database support revenue, moves to the cloud. That becomes at least $50 billion because it includes all the computers, all the networking, and all of that. The support was just 20% of the license fee. You move $10 billion of our database to the cloud, it becomes at least $50 billion in cloud revenue. It's almost as big as Oracle is now.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nYep.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThanks. Thanks, Larry and Safra.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Congrats for me as well. One subject we haven't really talked about was applications. With all the excitement around OCI, I think you don't get enough credit on applications. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? I had to go back in my model quite a bit to see 22% growth on Fusion, and the outlook looks really strong as well. You talked about accelerating growth there. With all the worries about tariffs and stuff like that, I kind of am surprised to see these very, very good numbers from you. Can you maybe talk about that a little bit? Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nSure. Tariffs have no impact really at all to play in this. What it does allow our customers to do is do what I do when I announce a year on day 11, is to be really much better run and have a better idea of where their business is and how it's doing, and to do more and spend a lot less. What you're seeing now, and it hasn't been obvious in the numbers because, as you know, we have our strategic SaaS products, and we break that down for you in the release to some extent. Those are going gangbusters. We've had other things in the numbers that have made you not be able to really see. We have some non-strategic products.\nIn addition, we've also had an advertising business, which we are now lapping. I stopped even mentioning it because what's the difference? A few hundred million. The reality is what you're starting to see is our strategic SaaS products as they roll out in our customer sites, and as they ramp up, they're very, very popular. They're obviously compelling because only if you're in the cloud can you use the AI capabilities. Many customers are still on-premise ERP products. Those can't really use the advanced agentics and AI capabilities. If you want to use that, and many do for automation and to do more, spend less, you've got to move to Fusion or NetSuite.\nThose are just very, very compelling. It's just now starting to show through the noise.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nI would add, let me add one thing, which is companies don't really enjoy buying applications from five different vendors and then making all of those applications work together. Some companies, not all, but some companies are saying, Oracle, you build these integrated suites of applications. They are all AI agent-based applications. They are modern applications, modern cloud applications. All of your applications are engineered to work with one another. Our ERP, EPM, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, customer engagement, all those apps are designed as a single suite of applications to run an enterprise or government agency.\nAll those pieces then work together, so there is no cost of integrating those applications. We are seeing a lot of companies basically saying, I am going to go all Oracle. I am going to buy the complete Oracle suite for ERP, EPM, supply chain, manufacturing. A lot of people do not have manufacturing. Supply chain, human resources, and customer engagement. They are picking us. If they pick our back office applications, they'll sometimes pick our front office applications over Salesforce as a result of that. Our customer engagement applications are getting better and better. We continue to invest in those.\nOur intent is to give some of our biggest customers a one-stop shop where they can buy the entire suite to run their enterprise from us. That gets rid of a lot of headaches. Everything is in the same database. Everything comes with the same AI data platform with it. All the analytics are there. Everything is there. You don't have to do the system integration. You don't have to buy a bunch of pieces and make them work together. That has been our strategy for some time. That's all coming together as a bunch of companies are not successfully navigating this difficult, admittedly difficult transition from on-premise to the cloud.\nThere have been a lot of companies that have not done it very well, and they're casualties. We're picking up a lot of their users. The application business is very, very promising. Then I add Oracle Health, Oracle Banking, Oracle Retail, Hospitality, the different industries on top of that. There's no other apps company that is trying to build such a broad-based, integrated suite of AI cloud application.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nWho's closest?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nThere's no one attempting to do what we're doing.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nMakes sense. Thank you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, and congrats. Safra, Larry, the things you've been telling us would happen are clearly happening. It's amazing. As we go forward, Larry, Oracle has always had the advantage of being the only vendor with enterprise-grade technology from apps all the way down to infrastructure. Since the Sun days, optimized even down to the silicon, why does the full-stack nature of what you do remain important as we enter this new era of computing?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nWell, such an interesting question because I think to some degree, people thought our biggest weakness is that we were just spread too thin. We're trying to do infrastructure, I mean, database initially, infrastructure, and then applications on top of that infrastructure. What made our database so good? I can argue we made some good technology decisions. The other thing that made our database so good is we developed apps on top of our own database. In the same company, you have people using the database to develop applications and the people who are developing that database.\nIf the applications found features missing from the database, they found capabilities they wish were in the database that would make their applications better, more reliable, more secure, we gained those insights by building those applications. Building applications allowed us to understand how to build database better. Building great databases made it much easier to build the cloud. There are a lot of databases that run the cloud. There's a database of our users. All of our resources are in databases. The autonomous database, the Oracle Autonomous Database, is one of the reasons our cloud, at some point, we're going to rechristen our cloud from Gen 2 cloud to the autonomous cloud.\nRight now, that would be too aggressive. We're not fully autonomous. We're getting there. Because we were able to use a lot of our existing database technology, specifically the autonomous database technology, to make our cloud more scalable and more reliable. By the way, when you eliminate human labor, when you have an autonomous database, you eliminate human labor, you save money, but you also eliminate human error and human mischief. It makes your cloud much more secure. One of the reasons our cloud is more secure, one of the reasons our cloud is faster, is because we have an autonomous database that runs it.\nHaving all of these levels of technology allows us to solve a technical problem at the right layer of the technology. Should we solve the problem in the network fabric? Should we solve the problem with our cloud computer controller, something we have with other people that we've embedded different hardware to run the cloud? We have different hardware architecture to make it more secure and more reliable. We have done innovation in the network, and we have done innovation in our host computing. We have an autonomous nonstop Linux operating system that we built, the autonomous database that manages all the data in the cloud, and so on.\nBeing able to solve problems at different layers of the technology, understanding the different layers of the technology, allows us to build an integrated solution that is faster, cheaper, and more reliable than what our competitors can do.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, Larry. Thanks, too, Brad. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Sarah for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."

Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\nBefore taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone.\nQ2 was another excellent quarter, with total revenue at the high end of my constant currency guidance, and EPS was actually $0.01 above the high end. These results are being driven by the fact that our largest revenue component, cloud services and license support, now represents 77% of total revenue and is also our fastest-growing line item, which in turn is driving the acceleration of overall revenue growth. We expect cloud revenue to reach $25 billion this fiscal year.\nThis is happening for several reasons. First, our cloud is faster and thus less expensive than other clouds. We remain the preferred cloud for AI workloads, as well as for non-GPU cloud infrastructure services. In addition, our ability to deploy our cloud in many sizes gives our customers flexibility. Our multi-cloud agreements with Microsoft, Google, and AWS provide customers more choice in how they can migrate their Oracle databases to the cloud. Our strategic SaaS applications continue to grow rapidly. We are also seeing more of our industry-based cloud applications come online, which immediately contribute to revenue growth.\nYou can see all of this in the momentum, in the acceleration of our cloud growth and the 50% growth of our $97 billion RPO number, remaining performance obligation. Today, we're telling you again that revenue growth will accelerate further in the coming quarters.\nTurning to Q2—and I want to remind you that our quarter ended on Saturday a week ago, and here we are announcing our results. That's only possible because we use Oracle Fusion. Now, as for the numbers, we saw all segments exceeding our internal forecast. Now, as the dollar strengthened in the quarter, the 1% currency benefit for total revenue and the $0.02 to $0.03 benefit for EPS that were present in my August guidance retreated, with total revenue and EPS in Q2 essentially unaffected by currency movements.\nAs usual, as I go over things today, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rate, as this is how we manage the business. So here it goes. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS and IaaS, was up 24% at $5.9 billion, with SaaS revenue of $3.5 billion, up 10%, and IaaS revenue of $2.4 billion, up 52%, on top of the 50% growth reported last year. As a reminder, we exited the advertising business last quarter, which had the effect of lowering the total cloud revenue growth by 2% this quarter.\nTotal cloud services and license support for the quarter was $10.8 billion, up 12%, driven again by OCI, our strategic cloud applications, and autonomous database. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $6 billion, up 17%. Record-level AI demand drove Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue up 52%. But excluding legacy hosting infrastructure, cloud services revenue was up 55%. Our infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of $9.7 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 58% as demand continues to outstrip supply.\nGrowth in the AI segment of our infrastructure business was extraordinary. GPU consumption was up 336% in the quarter, and we delivered the world's largest and fastest AI supercomputer, scaling up to 65,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs.\nCloud database services, which were up 28% and now have an annualized revenue of $2.2 billion, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud on OCI, either directly or through our database at cloud services with Azure, Google, and AWS, we expect the cloud database revenues collectively will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic SaaS.\nWe are currently live in 17 cloud regions with database at cloud services and have another 35 planned with Azure, Google, and AWS. Database subscription services, which includes database license support, were up 5%. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support, were $4.8 billion and up 7%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $8.4 billion and were up 18%. Software license revenues were up 3% to $1.2 billion, including Java, which saw excellent growth. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.1 billion, up 9% from last year.\nNow, shifting to gross profit and operating income, the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 9% in Q2. As our cloud businesses continue to scale, the gross margins of both cloud applications and cloud infrastructure have each been trending higher. We continue to display expense discipline, which, of course, we're known for, especially with R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses, which collectively continue to grow slower than revenue—a trend that I expect to continue. The Q2 operating income grew 10%, and the operating margin was 43%, up 60 basis points from last year.\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was actually 20.1%, which is higher than my 19% guidance. Even as the higher tax rate lowered EPS by $0.02, we still hit the high end of my constant currency guidance. Actually, we did better. The non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 in US dollars, up 10% in USD and 10% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $1.10 in USD, and that's up 24% in USD and 23% in constant currency. At quarter end, we had $11.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $9.4 billion, up 8%.\nWith CapEx at $4 billion for the quarter, free cash flow was -$2.7 billion, and operating cash flow was +$1.3 billion. Given the demand that you see in our RPO numbers and the additional demand we see in our pipeline, I expect fiscal year 2025 CapEx will be double what it was in fiscal year 2024. As always, we remain careful to pace and align our CapEx investments appropriately and in line with booking trends. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was up 19% at $20.3 billion, and free cash flow was $9.5 billion.\nOur remaining performance obligation or RPO, is now at $97.3 billion, up 50% in constant currency, and reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger and longer contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services are benefiting their businesses. Further, our cloud RPO grew nearly 80%, and now represents nearly three-fourths of total RPO. Approximately 39% of the total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, and we continue to see the growth of current RPO accelerate.\nWe have now about 98 cloud regions live and many, many more to follow. That we have more cloud regions than any of the other hyperscalers reflects the strategic advantage of our Gen 2 architecture. We can start a new cloud region with a handful of racks and then scale up with customer demands. Additionally, our data centers are highly automated and identical in features and function, varying only in scale. This sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continue to be a significant advantage for us.\nAs we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and in dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly a million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share.\nBefore I dive into specific Q3 guidance, I'd like to share some overarching thoughts about the financial benefits I expect we will see over the coming quarters and years. To start, we continue to see excellent demand for our cloud services, which you see in our RPO growth. While this growth is stellar, our pipeline is actually growing even faster, and our win rates are growing higher, with the recent win at Meta being a prime example of why we expect that our RPO balance will climb again in Q3. Meta was not booked in the Q2 quarter, only in Q3.\nIn fiscal year 2024, we signed some big deals, and many have begun to generate revenue. We expect that those will continue to ramp higher in the second half and be a key contributor to revenue growth acceleration this year and next. For fiscal year 2025, we remain very confident and committed to full-year total revenue growing double-digit and full-year total cloud infrastructure growing faster than the 50% reported last year.\nOkay, let me now turn to guidance, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. In terms of currency, we've seen a dramatic shift due to significant strengthening of the US dollar. To put this in perspective, in Q2, we expected currency to have a $0.03 positive effect on EPS. For Q3, assuming exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a $0.03 negative effect on EPS and a 2% negative effect on revenue. However, as the dollar strengthens, it may not hold out the whole quarter and may be different.\nAll right, total revenue is expected to grow from 9% to 11% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 7% to 9% in USD at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 25% to 27% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 23% to 25% in USD.\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 7% to 9% and be between $1.50 and $1.54 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% to 6% and be between $1.47 and $1.41 in USD. I should mention that my Q3 EPS guidance is negatively impacted by $0.05 due to an investment loss in another company that we are a partial owner of. Lastly, my EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, like in Q2, one-time tax events and other things can cause actual tax rates to vary.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nThank you, Safra.\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models. Our major AI customers include OpenAI, xAI, NVIDIA, Cohere, and most recently Meta with their large-scale Llama models. Oracle continues to win large AI training workloads because we're faster and less expensive than the other infrastructure clouds. We just extended our AI performance advantage by delivering the largest and fastest AI supercomputer in the world, scaling up to 65,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs.\nThe Oracle Cloud trains dozens of AI models and embeds hundreds of AI agents in cloud applications. Oracle's AI agents automate drug design, image and genomic analysis for cancer diagnostics, audio updates to electronic health records for patient care, satellite image analysis to predict and improve agricultural output, fraud and money laundering detection, dual-factor biometric computer logins, and real-time video weapons detection in schools.\nFurthermore, the better capabilities of the new AI version of our database, Oracle 23ai, enable our customers to easily use their existing data in their existing databases to augment and specialize the training of industry-standard generative AI models like ChatGPT, Grok, and Llama. The Oracle Cloud and the Oracle 23ai vector database make it easy for our customers to build their own AI agents and use their own data to reap the benefits of the AI revolution.\nOracle is training AI models and developing AI agents that will improve the rate of scientific discovery and economic development and corporate growth throughout the world. The scale of this opportunity is unimaginable. As Safra said, this fiscal year, total Oracle Cloud revenue should top $25 billion. And this is just the beginning of the beginning.\nBack to you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, Larry.\nRob, if you could please poll the audience for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one in your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again.\nYour first question today comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. I'd like to gain better insight into OCI. OCI is designed differently from its larger peers, deliverable in just 10 and shortly three racks of servers. Could you explain how the architectural difference impacts how you build and deliver OCI racks? How it will impact how many data center regions you could have compared to your peers, and then how might this affect your CapEx growth over the next five years? Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nOkay, well, all the data centers are the same racks. You can think of it as completely modular. We have a basic rack, and to build a region takes six racks, the smallest region we can build. Our racks start at under 50kW, and our biggest data center—excuse me—so our basic small data center is 50kW, and the largest data center we're currently building now is 1.6GW. So that's quite a range: 50MW to 1.6 GW. When we build them and we put them in inventory, the racks are pretty much the same. It's very easy for us to manufacture these. It's lower cost to manufacture these. The inventory is less because they're all kind of the same.\nFurthermore, every cloud region has all of our services. They have all the same services, so it's easy for customers. We don't have to provision like our competitors do. Our competitors have some of their services in some regions and some of their services in other regions. We have all of our services in all of our regions, even though we are both smaller in terms of our smallest region and larger in terms of our largest region than our competitors.\nWhen all of our racks are the same and all of our services are the same, they become very easy—or I should say easier—to automate. They're all identical. We have one suite of automation tools that works in all hundreds of our current regions, and it makes it possible because of the high degree of automation to run not dozens of regions, but hundreds or even theoretically thousands of regions as individual customers are dedicating their own region.\nIndividual customers are buying complete Oracle regions and installing them what seems like it would be on-premise, though it is a full Oracle Cloud region, just happens to be in a dedicated data center to that customer. We are selling a lot of those as well, so it allows us to address a market that our competitors can't reach. Standardization, automation, and from the smallest to the largest data centers give us a huge advantage in competing in this marketplace.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nOn the CapEx side, what we can do since our competitors always have to land with extremely large footprints before they can even get started, we can land with smaller footprints, have consumption, and expand as customers need it. This allows us to really match our capital expenditure with ultimately our revenue because we don't have to spend a long time with empty centers because we literally can start small and just fill them up as our customers are consuming. I think this is really something that is expressed also in the profitability of our cloud and keeps showing up because of that.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nExtremely helpful. I really do appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThanks for taking my question. It's impressive to see OCI growth 52% and even database as a service up 28%. As you execute on your multi-cloud strategy, can you provide some color on the database migration to cloud or even database as a service traction? What are you hearing from customers as they prepare to migrate on-prem database to cloud? How should we think about the contribution to revenue going forward?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nWell, our—oh, you go ahead, Larry, and then I'll finish. You go ahead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nNope. Nope.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nAll right. Let me start. As I mentioned and as you caught in my talking, 28%, it's now annualized revenue, just the cloud database services, of 2.2 billion. Imagine that is mostly, nearly entirely OCI without even the database at AWS, and Azure, and Google.\nThat also, though, has grown from zero to 100 million+ run rate already— past 100 million—and will be hundreds of millions probably as an exit. These cloud regions have only started opening. As I mentioned, though, we do now have 17 open and twice as many opening. I think what you're going to see is the database, as it moves to the cloud, is really only at the beginning.\nIn addition, though, I want to remind you that Cloud@Customers and our Alloy partners are also contributing to this. We have an enormous pipeline of customers who want to bring their databases to the cloud, but a number of them want to do it in their own dedicated regions that are just their own for either regulatory reasons or sovereignty reasons—again, an offering that only we have that none of our competitors have.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nYeah. Again, Microsoft is the only partner where the contract is more than a year old. Google is much more recent, and AWS is even more recent than Google. We're at the very beginning of multi-cloud. As Safra said, it's going to exit well over $100 million in its first year. The first year is starting when we got AWS, when we had all three. It will be a multi-billion dollar business, and it'll be a combination of AWS and Google and Azure, plus all of these Cloud@Customers, dedicated region Cloud@Customers. We're going to have hundreds of those regions.\nThe demand from individual customers, large banks, telecommunication companies building a half a dozen or so data centers, they want us to build a half a dozen data centers, sometimes more, inside their own dedicated facilities. They'll run the Oracle Cloud in dedicated regions. Again, we'll end up with hundreds of those, and it clearly is going to be a very large, rapidly growing multi-billion dollar business for us.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThat's great color. Thanks, Larry and Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThank you. Ken, I think I misspoke. Could you actually say the line correctly that I was supposed to say about guidance?\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nSure. Absolutely. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% to 6% and be between $1.47 and $1.51 in US dollars. Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nSorry. Sorry. I don't know what I said exactly, but that is correct. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you, and congrats on the continued acceleration at scale. Larry, as Oracle leads with larger and larger GPU clusters, there's healthy industry debate around scaling laws, with Elon Musk allegedly pushing the envelope of what's possible. I'm curious to hear your perspective as to whether there's diminishing returns on the amount of compute thrown at model training and Oracle's ongoing leadership in AI infrastructure and GPU superclusters. Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nWell, there's two elements to speeding up training. One is building larger and larger GPU clusters made up of faster and faster GPUs. It's a GPU cluster itself. The second element, something Oracle has been very, very focused on, is building networks that rapidly move large volumes of data into those GPU clusters. As you make these GPU clusters larger and faster, it's putting more and more demands on the network to be able to move huge amounts of data into those GPU clusters, so the GPU clusters aren't sitting there waiting for the data.\nIf they're sitting there waiting for the data, it becomes very inefficient. If you're paying by the minute and half the time, half of the 30 seconds, you don't have the data available, obviously, that's a scaling problem. That's an economic problem, and that's a performance problem. Oracle differentiates itself in its data centers by investing heavily in building networks and, by the way, switch software, all sorts of network software, and network hardware to move data more quickly.\nWe think the demand is really, as the GPU clusters get bigger and faster, the critical thing is for us to be able to move the data faster. We are investing heavily in that. We think we're going to maintain our advantage there. As we make our networks faster, the AI training will get faster. If no one makes the networking faster, then I think there's a potential bottleneck. But we're trying to avoid that bottleneck by speeding up our networking.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you. Can I shift gears a little bit and go back to the or go to the SaaS part of the business? If you look there, if you look at your growth rates, we're at kind of a late-stage point of the cycle where people usually don't look at their back-office systems. You guys are putting up really solid growth numbers there, outgrowing the peers. Can you talk a little bit of what's going on there? Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nActually, I don't agree with you that folks aren't looking at their back-office systems. In fact, I think there's an enormous amount of pressure to be more efficient for many companies. The competition is fierce in basically all industries right now. As companies, when they look at us, for example—that's why I always point out that it's, what is it, day nine, and that includes three weekend days since our quarter closed—that just shows how efficient you can be in running your operations. A lot of company executives actually come up to me and say we need to do that, we need to do more and spend a lot less doing it.\nWe see really enormous pipeline in customers who understand that they can first automate and simplify their own businesses to spend less so they can invest in the things that differentiate them. There's also enormous interest in using their data for AI and using those systems. We have, I don't know, dozens and dozens of AI agents that can really help companies spend a lot less and really do a better job serving their customers. We find enormous interest in this area, and no one has the capability and the data and the AI capability that Oracle can bring to a customer.\nActually, I think it's been one of the most exciting times in back-office and in front-office too. We have even our front-office systems also taking advantage of so many of our capabilities for our customers. So this has been a great time. In fact, our booking trends, which you don't see yet in revenues because we wait until they're implemented, have taken a market step up. We were going over those just today, and they've accelerated from last year quite significantly.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYes. Thanks very much, and congrats on the results. Safra, you talked a little bit about the pipeline strength at the end of your prepared comments. Can you just talk about your line of sight in terms of capacity coming online so that you all can recognize some of the revenue that's associated with the demand that you're seeing specifically around on the OCI side? Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nYes. The second half of this year—we're in it— is going to see a lot of capacity come online that we've been waiting for and that we've been working on. We expect that you're going to see that turning into revenues. Everything's accelerating even more.\nIn addition, though, we also expect our RPO to start moving up the actual base RPO number, which is, of course, up 50% year-over-year, but the number itself, we expect it to spike in this quarter and for the end of the year. We expect both capacity to come online for our customers, which it is, and so it'll burn down some of our RPO, but we also simultaneously expect to sign a number of very large contracts that will make our RPO number go up too.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from a line of John DiFucci from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you. Safra, you've shown us—I'm going to switch gears a little bit and go down to the bottom line here versus the top line—for years that Oracle's not going to do what I'll call empty business, that you don't make good profit on. It's been a while, but you've previously said that OCI gross margins have improved consistently. I think you just mentioned it again in your prepared remarks. I think the last time you actually threw out a number was a while ago, but it was in the low 30s for gross margins for OCI, and that was several quarters ago. Can you give us an update on the progress of that, especially given the massive growth you're seeing?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nIt's really amazing, but we are continuing to benefit from a number of things in OCI. Our gross margin percentage continues to improve. I know that many of you think that GPU business or OCI-based infrastructure business is not as profitable, and yet our margins in that business just continue to improve because of the number of things that Larry mentioned. For example, the way we run our cloud, the way we set up our cloud, everything's automated. Everything is run.\nBecause we are a software company to the core, we're always optimizing our software capabilities, which gives us really enormous leverage. Our operating margins in OCI, again, improved, and it's been really fantastic. They improve in OCI, our SaaS margins improve. Everything is improving with scale for us, even as we're investing. It just continues to improve.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThat's great to hear, and we continue to watch closely. Thank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, John.\nA telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us for the call today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Today's call is being recorded, and now I would like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Bond\n\nInvestor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, Krista. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our investor relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the investor relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.\nThese forward looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10K and 10Q, and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an absolutely incredible quarter. As you know, Oracle's Q4 is known for customers purchasing large software license contracts to power their businesses. Because of the pivot to the cloud, this Q4 was powered by the enormous demand for our cloud services, and they showed up in RPO, or remaining performance obligations. In Q4, Oracle signed the largest sales contract in our history, led by huge demand for training large language models, as well as record levels of sales for OCI, Autonomous, Fusion, and NetSuite. RPO was $98 billion, up $18 billion from Q3, and up 44% year-over-year from $68 billion last year. We are trading one-time non-recurring license revenue in return for much bigger strategic customer commitments for multi-year cloud revenue, from which we expect to further accelerate our revenue growth rate.\nThis is exactly what we've been targeting, and it bolsters my confidence that our overall revenue, earnings, and cash flow performance, as well as our growth rates, will only get stronger and accelerate. In short, this Q4 marks the full emergence of our high growth cloud businesses. I started talking about this tipping point four years ago, and you've seen it continue to play out in our results since then. As a reminder, we accelerated our US dollar revenue growth rate from negative 1% in fiscal year 2020 to plus 8% this past year, if you exclude Cerner. In addition, EPS has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate over that same period, and both operating cash flow and free cash flow, which of course we report on a trailing twelve month basis, were each declining 10% four years ago. This year, they grew 9% and 39%, respectively.\nCustomer conversations are now absolutely fully focused on our cloud services, as the results clearly show. Let me give you just a couple of examples, a few examples. First, as you saw, OpenAI selected Oracle to run deep learning and AI workloads on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Like many others, OpenAI chose OCI because it is the world's fastest and most cost effective AI infrastructure. In total, we signed over 30 AI contracts for over $12 billion this quarter and nearly $17 billion this year. Second, we continue to expand our work helping companies use our cloud applications portfolio to reinvent their businesses. As an example, a very large enterprise tech company signed a contract in Q4 for over $600 million, where we will be helping them transform their operations with Fusion to enable them to become more agile, faster growing, and more profitable.\nMay I say in the process we will replace out many of our competitors' products. These cross-pillar cloud deals, or suite deals, focus on business process re-engineering that incorporate multiple cloud applications that no one else can offer. I want to point out, by the way, that today is day 11 of our new fiscal year, and we are once again announcing our results not only for the quarter but the year, and giving guidance, making us faster than any other public company by a long shot. We are able to do this because of Fusion applications, and that is why companies are choosing Fusion, and our wonderful teams are showing them the way. Third, I'm pleased to announce that we've signed another multi-cloud partnership, this time with Google, OCI, and Google Cloud Network.\nInterconnect is available immediately in 10 regions, and we will be live with Oracle Database at Google Cloud in September, where customers can get direct access to Oracle Database services running on OCI deployed in Google Cloud data centers. What's driving this? Well, it is all about our comprehensive, highly differentiated, and secure cloud offering. Customers have progressed from their initial curiosity about Oracle Cloud into full-blown rollout. We have the most secure, complete, and cost-effective set of enterprise applications and infrastructure cloud technologies of any vendor. Not only are our cloud technologies vertically integrated to work together, but we offer flexible deployment models like public cloud, multi-cloud, sovereign cloud, dedicated cloud, or any other way our customers ask us to deliver.\nWe also offer Oracle Alloy, where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. Now, I'm going to dive into the details of Q4 and finish my prepared remarks with how this strength and momentum will impact fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Okay, let's start in Q4. The dollar strengthened from the time of my Q4 guidance, so we saw a 1% currency headwind to total revenue and a $0.01 currency headwind to EPS. As usual, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rate because this is how we manage the business. Total cloud revenue, i.e., SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.7 billion, up 23%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 20% at $5.3 billion, and SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 10%, and IaaS revenue of $2 billion, up 42% on top of last year's 77% growth.\nTotal cloud services and license support for the quarter was $10.2 billion, up 10%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database, and OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support, were $4.6 billion and up 6%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $7.7 billion and were up 16%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.6 billion, up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 42% excluding legacy hosting. OCI Gen 2 infrastructure cloud services grew 44% with an annualized revenue of $7.4 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 53%. Were it not for continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscriptions, which includes database license support, were up 6% and highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 26% and now have an annualized revenue of $2 billion.\nVery importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, either to OCI directly or using Database at Azure or Database at Google Cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be that third leg of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic SaaS, consistent with our strategic direction and reflecting customer preference for cloud services. Software license revenues were down 14% to $1.8 billion. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.3 billion, up 4% if you include Cerner, up 5% excluding Cerner. Shifting to margin, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 77%. This is a result of the mix between support and cloud, in which cloud is growing much faster than support. The gross margin percentages for software support and SaaS are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially.\nGross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale to that point. Though the gross profit dollars of cloud services and licensed support grew 8% in Q4, non-GAAP operating income was $6.7 billion, up 9% from last year. The operating margin was 47%, up from 44% last year. As we continue to drive more efficiencies in our business, looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate came out over 1% higher than my guidance at 20.1%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.63, and GAAP EPS was $1.11 in USD.\nAs a reminder, the non-GAAP tax rate last year was 9.2%, and this had an adverse effect on this quarter's EPS growth. Non-GAAP pre-tax income grew 14% in constant currency. You can figure out that had we had the same tax rate last year as this year, net income would have grown 14%, and EPS would have been up 12% in constant currency, 11% in USD. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $53 billion, up 6%. Total cloud services and license support revenue, which is entirely subscription based and accounts for nearly 3/4 of total revenue, was $39.4 billion, up 11%. Total application subscription revenues grew 9%, and infrastructure subscription revenue grew 13%. Total cloud services excluding Cerner were up 26% to $17.2 billion. SaaS revenue excluding Cerner was up 13% to $10.4 billion for the year.\nIaaS and cloud infrastructure revenue was up 50% to $6.8 billion for the year, with consumption revenue up 66% from last year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $5.56 in USD, up 9% in USD, and the full year operating margin percentage was 44%, up from 42% last year. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $9.3 billion, up 4% over the last four quarters. Operating cash flow was $18.7 billion, up 9%, and free cash flow was $11.8 billion, up 39%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion. As I mentioned, our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is now $98 billion, up 44% in constant currency, and the portion excluding Cerner, if you're curious, was up 60%. We signed several large deals in this quarter, and we have many more, many, many more in the pipeline.\nApproximately 39% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, and this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud Services are benefiting their businesses now. While we spent $3.5 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $2.8 billion shown in the cash flow statement is lower simply as a result of timing of payments. We are working as quickly as we can to get cloud capacity built out, given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. At this moment, we have 76 customer-facing cloud regions live, with 47 public cloud regions around the world, and another 19 being built. We have 11 Database at Azure sites live and more locations with Microsoft coming online soon, and we will have 12 Oracle Database at Google Cloud sites live this year.\nWe also have 13 dedicated regions live, and 15 more planned. We have several national security regions and EU sovereign regions live, with increasing demand for more of each. Finally, we already have two Alloy cloud regions live, with 11 more planned. Of course, we also have many, many, many cloud-at-customer installations. As I mentioned earlier, the sizing, flexibility, and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredibly advantageous for us in the marketplace. This quarter, we purchased 1.25 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors today declared a dividend of $0.40 per share. Before I discuss my guidance for Q1 and fiscal 2025, I do just want you to have a couple of notes.\nThe first is that in Q4 we decided to exit the advertising business, which had declined to about $300 million in revenue in fiscal year 2024. Also, I will no longer be breaking out the Cerner business in my results, and even though it will begin to grow modestly throughout the year in both revenue and operating margin, it's not necessary to break it out anymore because it is now operating in a growth mode. Now to guidance. Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong cloud demand to push Oracle sales and RPO even higher, and result in double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year. I also expect that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous quarter as OCI capacity increases to meet demand.\nWe believe our momentum, our current momentum will continue as our pipeline is growing even faster than bookings, and our win rates are going higher as well. I expect fiscal year 2025 cloud infrastructure services to grow faster than the 50% we reported this year. CapEx in fiscal year 2025 will probably be double what it is in fiscal year 2024, what it was in fiscal year 2024. Beyond this fiscal year, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal year 2026 financial goals for revenue, operating margins, and EPS growth. However, given our strong bookings results, I believe some of these goals might prove to be too conservative. Given our momentum, we are going to provide you a more fulsome update on all of this at the Financial Analyst meeting at Oracle CloudWorld in Las Vegas in September.\nOkay, let me now turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. Now, if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a negative 1% effect on my revenue and either a penny or two pennies negative on EPS in Q1. However, as you all know, actual currency impact may be more or less. I just can't guess that. Now, total revenue for Q1 are expected to grow from 6%-8% in constant currency, and using the currency situation as it is now, they're expected to grow from 5%-7% in USD. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 21%-23% in constant currency and 20%-22% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 11% and 15% and be between $1.33 and $1.37 in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.31 and $1.35. This time in USD, my EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%, and as always, one-time tax events could cause the actual tax rates to vary. From my guidance, okay, I know that was long, but with that, let me turn it to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nThank you, Safra. I'm going to start by repeating something Safra said. Excuse me? In Q4, Oracle's company-wide RPO increased 44% to $98 billion. In AI alone, we signed contracts with 30 different customers for $12.5 billion in new AI business. These astonishing RPO numbers, 44% and $98 billion, were driven by massive increases in sales of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI. Who are the companies choosing to use Oracle cloud services and Oracle data centers? Well, here are a few names: Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, xAI, OpenAI, Cohere, and dozens more. In other words, the world's largest cloud companies, and the world's most successful and accomplished AI companies, choose to use Oracle cloud services and data centers. Excuse me again. Why are they working with Oracle? Because Oracle's Gen2 cloud infrastructure is different. OCI's RDMA network moves data much faster.\nWhen you charge by the minute, faster also means less expensive. OCI trains large language models several times faster and at a fraction of the cost of other clouds. OCI's critical cloud software, the operating system, and the database are fully autonomous. At OCI, human beings do not run the operating system or the database. Autonomous software, robots do. No one else has this level of autonomy in the cloud. Eliminating human labor eliminates human error. Almost all cloud security breaches begin with human error. Eliminating the possibility of human error is the only way to make certain your cloud data is not stolen. That's it. The most important technology companies in the world are using OCI because it's faster, less expensive, and more secure. Easy to say, not easy to do. Back to you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nInvestor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, Larry. Krista, if you could please poll the audience for questions, we'll begin the Q and A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you. Congrats from me. These are very impressive numbers. Safra, can you try to help us bridge the strong RPO number and how we need to think about feeding that into revenue? Is that just a capacity function, or is there anything on the customer side that you need to deliver? On the technology side, you need to deliver? Just help us to bridge the gap on those things. Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nIt's all about capacity. It is as we bring the capacity online, wherever it's going online around the world, is when those workloads are coming over. A lot of the engineering work is done in advance so that those customers know how they can operate. They bring smaller workloads, but the bigger workloads, they're just waiting for us to go online and make it available to them. It is really that level. We are scheduling them on our availability, and as I mentioned, our pipeline to take more deals is all about us just getting the capacity up and live, and moving forward.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nIt's just a mechanical problem in a way?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nYeah, well, it's not a problem. It's just the schedule. As things come online, as the data centers go live, or as we deliver the computer, they're just getting. It's just very straightforward. There's no magic here. These customers have done a lot of the analysis and the engineering in advance and have tested us or competed us against our competitors and have chosen us already, understanding how we work, and they're just waiting for us to give them more capacity.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nVery impressive. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick (Deutsche Bank AG}\n\nManaging Director\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Congrats from me as well, Larry. It's great to see the amazing momentum in OCI, especially given it's a competitive market. The leading names in AI are coming to you wanting to partner with Oracle. Can you talk about the innovation roadmap for OCI and your AI services in particular, and why we should expect Oracle to keep on winning, not just today, but over the next several years to come in this market?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nOkay. Well, I think in OCI, we've talked for a while about our ability to build very small data centers. One you could put in a ship or a submarine or a full cloud, a full Oracle Cloud we will soon have in six standard half racks to go into a conventional data center. Virtually any one of our customers could choose to have the full Oracle Cloud in their data center. With every service, every service in the cloud, they could scale that up quite extraordinarily large. We talk about the fact that we can start very small, and that's a huge difference between us and our competitors. We can actually put it again, customer by customer. Small countries we can do. What we haven't talked so much about is we're also building the largest data centers in the world.\nWe talked about, I think we talked briefly about one last call where we can park. It's a 70 MW data center where we can park eight 747 nose to tail in the data center, the huge AI training data center, while we're also building a 200 MW data center. In fact, this past quarter, we sold about half of that data center for a period of time. We're now bringing 200 MW data centers online. We are literally building the smallest, most portable, most affordable cloud data centers, all the way up to 200 MW data centers, ideal for training very large language models and keeping them up to date. This AI race is going to go on for a long time.\nIt's not a matter of getting ahead, just simply getting ahead in AI, but you also have to keep your model current, and that's going to take larger and larger data centers. Some of the data centers we have that we're planning are actually even bigger. Some are getting very close to, dare I say it, a gigawatt, which is a pretty good sized city or one enormous AI cloud training data center. No one else can span this range. In every case, we have unbelievably fast networks that are a part of this. The data centers we're building include the power plants, the transmission of the power directly into the data center, and liquid cooling, because these modern data centers are moving from air cooled to liquid cooled, and you have to engineer them from scratch.\nThat's what we've been doing for some time, and that's what we'll continue to do. Currently, we are leading the pack in being able to deliver that quality and that scale of data center.\n\nBrad Zelnick (Deutsche Bank AG}\n\nManaging Director\n\nAmazing. Thank you so much, Larry.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Sanjiv Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho Securities Co.\n\nThank you, Larry and Safra, it's impressive to see how fast you ramped OCI at Azure, now available in 11 data centers. Now, with this Google partnership, we'll have Oracle Database at Google Cloud. I have two questions. One is, as you embark on offering this multi-cloud flexibility to customers, when can we see a similar partnership with AWS? Second, how should we think about these partnerships helping your customers migrate their on-prem Oracle workloads to cloud?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nI don't know, Larry, if you wanted.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho Securities Co.\n\nTo.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nI can start. Well, we believe in giving customers choice, and customers want choice. Customers are using multiple clouds, not only infrastructure clouds, but they might have Salesforce applications or Workday applications, or they use multiple cloud in their business right now. It is very important, we think, that all the clouds become interconnected. We are thrilled to have the connection with Microsoft and be building OCI data centers right inside of Azure, so the computers are next to each other to minimize network costs and network latency, which is all good things. We are doing the same thing with Google. We would love to do the same thing with AWS. We think we should be interconnected to everybody, and that is what we are attempting to do in our multi-cloud strategy. I think that is what customers want. I am optimistic that is the way the world will settle out.\nWe'll get rid of these fees for moving data from cloud to cloud, and all the clouds will be interconnected. Customers can pick their favorite service from their favorite cloud, and mix and match whatever they want to use, and do it easily and seamlessly.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nYeah.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho Securities Co.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dive a bit deeper on just precisely how many deployment models you guys are offering for OCI because it feels as though that is getting particularly differentiated as we start to think of sovereign cloud, govcloud, more private cloud, given the conservative posture for AI and data privacy. How do we think about how much of an advantage that is providing in sales cycles, and maybe in that massive $30 billion plus in the second half, RPO? Also, just comment on the magnitude of that opportunity going forward.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nI'm going to take a swing at this one. Every medium-sized on-premise customer that Oracle has could have a private cloud, a full Oracle cloud where they have no neighbors. They are the only user of that Oracle cloud, and we can install that in their existing data centers. Nobody else can do that. You have to move to the public cloud. We have public cloud, we have a lot of public cloud regions. We love the public cloud. If you're very conservative and you want to absolutely maximize security and that's important to you, we can put in a cloud, a full Oracle cloud, and we run it. We pay for it. Again, it's an Oracle region. We put an Oracle cloud region, and let me just make up a name, Samsung. We could build a cloud region for Samsung.\nIn fact, two cloud regions is for Samsung. We could do two cloud regions making up names. General Motors, Ford, anybody, any company. Those are pretty big companies, but much smaller companies as well. We're the only ones that give you an option to have the full capability of a public cloud run by Oracle. All of our services, every single one of our services, you don't pay for the hardware, you just pay for what you use. Put that model directly on your premises, and you can use it. No one else is in that cloud. We can do that. No one else can do it. We can put them on ships and on submarines. No one else can do it because we can start very, very small. All Oracle clouds are identical except for scale. All Oracle clouds have all Oracle services.\nAll Oracle clouds are fully automated because they're identical. They're fully automated. One of the reasons we took a little bit longer to get our cloud out was because we built something quite different than what our competitors have, and that allows us to go from very small to very large using the same automation software. I think some of our competitors, their large data centers, some are quite different than other data centers. They might have different, some services might be available in some data centers and not in others. They did a very different approach to what we did. We had the advantage of seeing what all the other guys did, and we took a different road. It took us a bit longer. We think we're better off in terms of security, and we're better off in terms of scalability.\nBy the way, that means the ability to go down in size and up in size. It allows us to get to every corner of the globe, and provide a level of privacy for your data that other cloud providers cannot provide.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nYeah. Because, as Larry said, whatever the deployment model is, you don't have to compromise. Some of our competitors may offer some level of sovereignty, or some level of disconnected, but they don't actually have all the services for us. The reason we've been so successful is whether it's disconnected, or sovereign, or whatever it is, the customer always gets everything, all services, not just some services.\nAnd.\nThey get to deploy it any way they want, and they get the security or the regulatory requirements. Sovereignty may be very critical. For most governments, they don't want their data in the public cloud out and about. They want to have it sovereign to their country. No compromises, no compromises on the services, and no compromises on security.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nIt also sounds like you guys have a better price in most cases. Thanks again.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nMuch because we're so much faster. When you use our cloud, it is new, it's modern, but it also has technical advantages, so it runs your workload so much more quickly. When you pay by the minute, the second, if your workload ends in a tenth the time, you pay a tenth the price. That's very hard to compete with.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nOne last comment. One last comment. One last comment. The other thing is our cloud was designed not for hundreds of regions, but for thousands or possibly even tens of thousands of data centers and regions. That's why we had to put in a high degree of automation. There is no way we can run these, that we could run these data centers manually. There are too many of them, and we're building them too fast. We couldn't hire people fast enough and train people fast enough. The risk of them making a mistake, an error, is the risk. Well, they start exposing our customers' data. So they are highly automated. It's a little bit like, I flatter myself, comparing it to the satellites that Elon Musk puts in the sky. Starlink has more, there are more, he has more satellites than everyone else in the world combined.\nBecause again, it's very different. It's a satellite system, Starlink, that's designed for a very large number of satellites that are highly automated, and same model, lots and lots of them, 100% or nearly 100% automation to run these clouds.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYes, thanks very much. I'll echo the congrats on the cloud momentum. Larry Ellison, I was wondering to expand a bit on the OpenAI announcement this afternoon, just what that entails in terms of how you'll be working with them or Microsoft. Are there certain workloads they'll be working on with you directly? Can you just give us whatever additional color you have on that deal? Obviously very exciting. Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nWell, yeah, go ahead, go ahead. No, you can, you can go ahead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nOkay. All right. Well, you know, we're building a very, very, you know, large data center. Very big, about half of a half of a huge data center we're building for them. Lots of Nvidia chips, the new Nvidia chips, the new Nvidia Interconnect, liquid cooled. They're primarily for training, I mean not inferencing. It's doing masses and masses of training, and I don't know, that's what we're doing. The training, you know, the training goes beyond languages because now these systems are even, they're called, even though they're called large language models, really part of their proper name is probably neural networks. They're neural networks, and they're trained not just with language but masses of images as well.\nFor example, Oracle is very involved with taking biopsy slides and using microscopes to read biopsy slides, recording those images, and then using AI to diagnose cancer from these biopsies. It's one of the projects we're working on on the medical side of our business. These large language models, strangely enough, are also looking at biopsies. They're not just reading things language, they're also looking at images and interpreting images. That is actually a bigger and more complicated problem than understanding language. That's what's so exciting about, again, second time I've mentioned Elon, an Elon company, Tesla is very close to getting full service driving authorized in China. I'm not speaking out of school. I think the Chinese government's moving along. Full self driving.\nFull self driving in China, in order to train a car to do full self driving, you train it on vast amounts of images because the car has to look at these images and then decide what it's going to do next. That's what it does. It doesn't speak, it just responds to what it sees. That's a very different problem than answering a question posed in any language. Everyone's going to be training their models on imaging. That's a huge amount of additional data, a huge amount of additional training. We're right in the middle of it.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question today comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJOHN DIFUCCI\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you for taking my question. My question, I think, is for Safra. Safra, the IaaS revenue growth has been really impressive, and it has been for a while here, but perhaps even more so the last couple quarters, especially as the backlog, given its scale. This may be somewhat of an obvious question for you, but it's based on my conversation with investors. There are two high-profile topics that I want to make sure we understand: what the contribution has been today versus next year, and that's Oracle Database at Azure and AI in general. We've heard a lot of conversation about the former when we speak to partners and customers in the field, and you've spoken a lot about the latter today.\nBeyond conversation volume, can you talk a little bit more about what the contribution of these two topics has been to that impressive IaaS revenue growth in this quarter versus what we should expect that contribution to be in fiscal 2025?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nOkay. I would tell you that both of them, both, whether it's Database at Azure or even the AI workloads as they come on board, they are all incremental to anything you saw so far in our revenues. The Database at Azure, those centers are just going live now. Even though we are selling quite a bit of ARR there, these are small and growing very, very fast. The revenue in Q4 of, let's say, Azure was very small. Q1 will be 10 times as much. Q2 will be potentially 30 times as much. It is extremely incremental to our current run rate. By the way, that is also true. We have revenue, AI revenues so far. Yes, we do.\nWe've been announcing those, these contracts that we are signing that we've signed at the end of Q3 and that are signed at the end of Q4 are so much larger in size that they will be incremental to everything you saw this past year. Literally incremental, added by quite a bit. It is going to be, this is a very exciting time obviously, and everything is incremental to what you've seen so far because it dwarfed it in many ways.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThat is really clear, and it really speaks to, I think, what you started talking about a long time ago, especially a lot more publicly. Geez, I don't know, in the fall of 2022, but thanks, that's really clear.\n\nKen Bond\n\nInvestor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, John. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Krista for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle\n\nSam Sa."

Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. We had another excellent quarter with Q3 revenue coming in as expected and EPS $0.02 above the high end of my guidance range. Now, before I get into the results of the quarter, I wanted to touch on the strength of our infrastructure cloud business. OCI has emerged as the largest driver of our overall revenue acceleration, growing much, much faster than our cloud competitors. Customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they can really get more while paying less. It's not just the cost that matters to our customers.\nBeyond the superior price performance of OCI, customers are choosing Oracle and Oracle services for multiple reasons. First, we know better than anyone what it takes to run the full stack of technology that goes into mission-critical workloads. I'm talking about running at enterprise scale with comprehensive security and unparalleled support. That's from decades of experience running the world's most important workloads and optimizing clustering technology, which is critical to artificial intelligence workloads and database services. Secondly, our AI capabilities are unique as they're built in to help customers drive business outcomes.\nThis is more than integrating generative AI across our Fusion and industry cloud applications and Autonomous Database, which we have done. It's also about enabling and refining these AI models with the customer's own data to better understand and serve their operations without them losing control of their own data. Third, we provide deployment flexibility for customers based on how they want to run in the cloud. In addition to offering public cloud services, we remain the only vendor which also offers a dedicated and complete cloud at customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner cloud.\nCustomers do not have to compromise the services they receive while meeting their deployment needs. Finally, we provide multi-cloud offerings so customers can consume our cloud services in the public cloud of their choice. We offer Oracle Database at Azure with Microsoft, as well as MySQL HeatWave through multiple clouds. You can expect more multi-cloud services to come. Now to Q3 results, which I would like to point out I had the actual results on day five and signed off with my auditors days ago. I am just bragging a little bit, but I could not help it. I know a lot of CFOs are pretty jealous.\nAs I mentioned earlier, total revenue came in at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance, and EPS was above the high end of guidance. As was the case when I gave guidance last quarter, currency had little effect in Q3. I'll still discuss our results using constant currency growth rates in the few areas that the rates are slightly different. Here we go. Cloud revenue, that's SaaS and IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.4 billion, up 26%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $5.1 billion, with IaaS revenue of $1.8 billion, up 49%, and SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 14%. This quarter marks the first time our total cloud revenue is more than our total license support revenue.\nWe have crossed over. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $10 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database, and OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support, were $4.6 billion, up 10%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $7.4 billion, and were up 18%. Infrastructure revenues, which includes license support, were $5.4 billion, up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 49%. Excluding legacy hosting services, OCI Gen2 Infrastructure Cloud Services revenue grew 52%, with annualized revenue of $6.7 billion.\nOCI consumption revenue was up 63%. Were it not for some continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscription revenue, which includes database license support, was up 5%, and highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 34% and now have annualized revenue of $1.9 billion. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and OCI. Software license revenues were $1.3 billion, down 3%.\nAll in, total revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, up 7% including Cerner, and up 9% excluding Cerner. Now to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 77%. This is, as before, a result of the mix between support and cloud, in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS gross margin percentages are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially year-over-year. While we continue to build data center capacity, overall gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale.\nTo that point, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 8% in Q3. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.8 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin was 44%, up from 42% last year, as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our operating expenses, which continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin percentages.\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was very close to my guidance at 18.9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.41, up 16% in both USD and constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.85. At quarter end, we had nearly $9.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.2 billion, up 18%, and free cash flow was $12.3 billion, up 68%. Capital expenditures were $6 billion over the same time period as we continue to see cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation.\nOur remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $8 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 41% in constant currency. We signed several large deals this quarter, and we have many more in the pipeline. Approximately 43% of our total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. This reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud Services are benefiting their businesses.\nWe expect to have some very nice joint announcements with NVIDIA next week. While we spent $2.1 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $1.7 billion in the cash flow statement is slightly lower just due to the timing of payments. The $2.1 billion is actually what we spent and will pay for. We are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out, given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. I expect the CapEx will be somewhere around $7 to 7.5 billion this fiscal year, meaning our Q4 CapEx should be considerably higher.\nTo that point, we now have 68 customer-facing cloud regions live, with 47 public cloud regions around the world, and another eight being built. Twelve of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, and more locations with Microsoft are coming online soon. We also have 11 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, several national security regions, and EU sovereign regions live, with increasing demand for more of each. Finally, we already have two Alloy cloud regions live, with five more planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside Oracle Cloud.\nOf course, we have also many, many, many cloud customer installations. As I mentioned earlier, the sizing, flexibility, and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be an incredible advantage for us in the marketplace. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months. The board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share today.\nNow, before I dive into Q4 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see for the next 12 months or so. As demand for our cloud services continues getting stronger, our pipeline is growing even faster, and our win rates are going higher as well. As our supply constraints ease, revenue growth rates will accelerate higher as our capacity expands and we get into fiscal year 2025. I should also say that we continue to expect that FY 2024, of which we are now in the fourth quarter, total revenue excluding Cerner will accelerate from last year as it has for the past three years, and will likely be significantly higher in FY 2024.\nIn addition, Cerner, which is a significant headwind this year, we expect to return to growth next year. I remain firmly committed to our FY26 financial goals for revenue, operating margin, and EPS growth. However, some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis as always. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, of course, actual currency impact may be different. At least right now, all the numbers are the same for constant currency and USD.\nTotal revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 4% to 6. Total revenue excluding Cerner are expected to grow 6% to 8. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 22% to 24 as more capacity comes online in Q4. The EPS growth rate will be affected by the compare as our Q4 tax rate last year was 9.2%, which I believe most of you have already accounted for in your models. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. As always, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary from my guidance like they did last year. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be down 2% or to flat and be between $1.62 and $1.66. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Safra. Well, Oracle signed another big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with NVIDIA in Q3. Oracle's Gen2 AI infrastructure business is booming. That's become pretty clear to everybody. In addition to selling infrastructure for training AI large language models, Oracle is also completely re-engineering its industry-specific applications to take full advantage of generative artificial intelligence. The best example of this is in healthcare, where Oracle did not just add a bit of AI around the edges of existing applications. Instead, we developed completely new applications using our APEX application generator and our Autonomous Database.\nThese all-new applications use generative AI throughout the application. The best example is in healthcare, where our new Ambulatory Clinic System is being delivered to customers this Q4. This completely new application features a voice interface called the Clinical Digital Assistant. The Clinical Digital Assistant listens to a doctor's consultations with a patient and automatically generates prescriptions, doctor's orders, doctor's notes, then automatically updates the patient's electronic health records.\nThe Clinical Digital Assistant's voice interface makes our new healthcare systems dramatically easier to use, and saves hours of doctors' precious time every day, which now can be spent with patients rather than typing into a computer. The delivery of our new AI-centric healthcare cloud applications, including the Ambulatory Clinic System, the Clinical Digital Assistant, and the Health Data Intelligence System, will enable the rapid modernization of our customers' healthcare systems and transform Oracle Health and Cerner into a high-growth business for years to come. Ken, back to you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe don't hear you, Ken.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you. Thank you, Larry. Sorry about that. Krista, if you could please poll the audience for questions, and if we could proceed from there. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you. Safra, the infrastructure as a service growth of 49% implies a Herculean increase in new business coming online, new ARR, the way we model it anyway. Something I just thought you wouldn't be able to do this quarter given how much you had to do. We realize we don't know the timing of when deals come online. Last quarter, you said you were going to reallocate resources to focus on some of these very large OCI deals to get them implemented earlier so you start to get revenue earlier. Is that what happened this quarter? Is that what we're seeing? Or is that still to come?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nHonestly, John, that is still to come. This is just pretty much our regular way business. That's what you're seeing. We have enormous amounts of demand. I tried to make that clear last quarter. We have more capacity coming online. We tried to focus on much larger chunks of data center capacity, electricity, and all of that. That's all to come. This is really our regular way business, and our customers just growing. A whole bunch of new customers, by the way. I think there are many, many customers who have come on and that haven't gotten capacity yet. We've got at least 40 new AI bookings that are over $1 billion that haven't come online yet.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThat sounds.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nJohn.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nLet's go ahead, Larry. Sorry.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay. Let me add that Oracle is building data centers at a record level. A lot of people, I think, are aware that we can build fairly small data centers to get started when we want to. The unique thing about Oracle's data centers is they're all identical except for scale. We do not have custom data centers. They all have all the Oracle services. One of the things that's unusual about them is they're all completely automated. They come up on their own and they kind of run their selves. I mean, look, we do have a bunch of people working on these data centers, but they are extremely high, they're highly automated.\nOur operating system is Autonomous Linux. Our database is via Oracle Autonomous Database. Our new HeatWave database, Microsoft MySQL HeatWave, is highly automated. Therefore, we can build every time we build a data center, it's like the data center we built before, except for one thing: scale. We can go very small. We can get a full cloud data center with all the services in 10 racks. This is what I want to point out. We're also building the largest data centers in the world that we know of. We're building an AI data center in the United States where you could park eight Boeing 747s nose to tail in that one data center.\nWe are building large numbers of data centers. Some of those data centers are smallish, but some of those data centers are the largest AI data centers in the world. We're bringing on enormous amounts of capacity over the next 24 months because the demand is so high. We need to do that to just satisfy our existing set of customers. Give you an idea. One more thing in terms of data centers, we're building 20 data centers for Microsoft and Azure. They just ordered three more data centers this quarter, adding to that already. There are other multi-cloud agreements that are being signed.\nThere are a number of multi-cloud agreements in Japan, where computer manufacturers in Japan are adopting our cloud and will be reselling our cloud as partners. We think NRI is already doing that, but there are a number of other companies that are going to be doing that. That's something we're seeing, over demand for data centers of people who want to buy Alloy and then resell our cloud services with their proprietary cloud services on top of it. We're seeing that.\nSome of our largest customers all over the world want their own Oracle region. They do not want to share a public cloud. They want a cloud region dedicated, or actually multiple cloud regions dedicated to that bank, or that technology company, or that telephone company. They are building their own data centers, which are Oracle cloud data centers. They are all identical, so we are able to automate and run those with not a lot of additional labor costs. It is a huge advantage for us.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nWell, thank you, Larry and Safra. Listen, what you put up this quarter in infrastructure as a service just looks pretty impressive. It sounds like there's a lot more to come. Thank you for taking my question.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nJohn, my last comment would be the growth in RPO is what's to come. RPO is obviously growing faster than revenue because we can't meet the demand. That's the measure of demand. The $80 billion RPO is quite an acceleration of demand. Demand is not slowing down. It's actually increasing quite a bit.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nWell, there were a lot of questions on that last quarter. I guess there won't be any on this one. Thank you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, John. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHey, thank you. Congrats from me as well. I wanted to talk a little bit about Cerner. In the announcement, you talked about most of Cerner now. It's running out of your OCI. Well, first of all, that's a very quick turnaround here, so well done. What's kind of the implications for that, both from running efficiency, but also innovation on the platform? Thank you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, two things. One is we save a huge amount of money moving them into our standard data center, right? Because our OCI costs are much lower than the cost of the Cerner dedicated data center in Kansas City. Also, the big thing that we're excited about is OCI is highly secure. It's got a highly secure perimeter, and therefore, those applications are much less vulnerable to ransomware or other kinds of attacks than if they were in a different kind of data center. We're very happy that these are now secured. The third thing is now that they're in our cloud, we're able to update those applications on a regular three-month cadence.\nWe're able to modernize those customers that are in the cloud on a regular basis and start delivering our brand new applications, the completely rewritten Cerner application, first for ambulatory clinics and then eventually for acute care hospitals. The Ambulatory Clinic System is coming out this quarter. We're able to automatically deliver that system to existing customers. It's not a reimplementation. It is literally an update to what they've already got running in the Oracle Cloud. Even though it's an all-new application, I'm not going to get into too much technical detail, but it uses the same underlying data schema.\nWe literally can bring up the new application without the customer having to go through any implementation process. We can do it just as an update, like when we ship a new version of Fusion to an existing Fusion customer. We can now ship an all-new version of the Cerner application to a Cerner customer in OCI. It allows us to modernize their infrastructure very, very rapidly, deliver the Voice Clinical Digital Assistant, make the system easy to use, save doctors' time, deliver a lot more value, put in the diagnostic imaging systems, the Health Data Intelligence System, and deliver all of that automatically on a regular three-month cadence. It allows us to modernize the Cerner base very, very quickly while keeping them safe from ransomware.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you this afternoon. Larry and Safra, can you talk a little bit about CapEx? Your guidance implies almost doubling of CapEx in the fourth quarter. What kind of trajectory is needed for the next fiscal year given this RPO growth? What kind of uptick is needed? Larry, if you don't mind, if you can give some color on GPU availability and how that plays in versus data center requirements in terms of that spending. Thanks so much.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, I'm looking at about $10 billion in CapEx because it's also involved not only some big centers, but it also involves expansion of existing centers. We've already got some areas that we'll be filling out. At least preliminarily, we're looking at $10 billion for next year. It's not too complicated to figure out the math here when I'm looking at somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year. You've got all the numbers for Q1, Q2, and Q3 at this point.\nI would include for Q3, the one we just are announcing, I would add in the amount we haven't paid yet as the CapEx number for this quarter. Okay? That would be, and then Larry gets the second question. Anyway, $2.1 billion for this quarter. You've got Q1 and Q2. I'm going to be somewhere between seven and seven and a half for the full year, which is actually a little bit lower than I thought. We were able to do pretty well. You know how we spend very carefully.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nGreat, thanks. Larry, the amount that, how's the GPU availability in terms of you hitting your goals vis-à-vis other bottlenecks that could be out there?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nCan I take at least part of this? The GPU.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nOh, yeah. Sure.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWe are good. We are actually very good in our GPU access and capability. Building the computers and that, it's much more making sure we've got the power on that.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. Safra says we have a great relationship with NVIDIA. They're a customer of ours as well as us being a customer of theirs. We work very closely together, so that's going pretty well. Building these, I mean, the scale of some of these data centers is breathtaking. The one we're building in Salt Lake, you can park 8 747s nose to tail. We can give you a video of this thing under construction, but it's hard. I mean, it's breathtaking. There's a tremendous amount of demand. The data centers take longer to build than we would like.\nThat said, we are getting very good at building them quickly. Getting the building, the power, and the communication links in, we're doing faster than we have ever had in the past. The thing is, once we deliver the hardware, the hardware comes up very, very quickly because the process of bringing up the hardware is now all automated. It's very different than it used to be. We're able to bring additional capacity online very quickly if we have the electric power and the communication links. The long pole in the tent is actually building the structure, connecting the electricity, and connecting the communication links.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nThanks, Larry. Appreciate it. Congrats on the OCI growth.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. Larry, just within the last few months, you guys have enabled Oracle Database and OCI to be run on top of Azure, which seems like a fairly significant development. Can you talk about what the customer reception has been around this announcement, how you think it could change the arc of new investments on the Oracle Database platform, and what this means for potentially unlocking a stronger adoption cycle for Autonomous Database?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, I think it is the key to unlocking a stronger adoption cycle for, A, moving Oracle in general to the cloud in general, and specifically the migration to Autonomous Database. Oracle, we expect the multi-cloud initiative to continue to expand. We're seeing it expand in Japan, but we expect it to expand amongst other hyperscalers to adopt a similar multi-cloud approach where we build OCI regions inside of and coexisting with their existing cloud infrastructure. We think the era of walled gardens is coming to an end. Where it used to be, okay, I'm going to move all my stuff to AWS, or, I'm going to move all my stuff to Azure.\nWhat customers really want is the ability to use multiple clouds, and for those multiple clouds to talk to one another. I think, I mean, in the era of the internet and now cloud computing, it is really called cloud computing. It's not called a bunch of separate clouds. We expect multi-cloud to become the norm, and Oracle to be available everywhere. Back to what you said, we think that will preserve our franchise in database, where we've been the number one database in the IT ecosystem for a very long time. We think that's going to preserve that franchise and expand it, because the Autonomous Database is a unique piece of technology, and there's nothing like it in the world. Maybe the most interesting thing, no one else is working on anything like that. No one else is even trying to duplicate the Autonomous Database. We think it will become a very successful product in every cloud.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThanks, Larry.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks very much for taking the questions, and congrats on an incredible bookings quarter. Larry, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the interest level on Alloy in international markets where there might be a bit of a premium on data sovereignty, and maybe how that's impacting the growth opportunity for OCI when we look out towards the balance of calendar 2024. Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, I think Japan is maybe the most interesting market where we had early success with NRI. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Now, what NRI has is a couple of Oracle Cloud regions, which they resell in the financial services community inside of Japan. One of their applications is a major stock exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Think about how many clouds run stock exchanges. That would be ours. It's got to be highly secure, it can never go down, it's got to have extremely high transaction rates. We can do that. The success of NRI has caused the other computer companies in Japan to become very, very interested in also reselling our cloud.\nWe also have the ability that they can add on some of their own technology to our cloud. Our cloud is open. You can plug in other things to the cloud. Imagine a big computer company in Japan adopting the Oracle Cloud, reselling Autonomous Database, reselling all of our technologies because we only make one kind of cloud. They're all the same, and they have all of the services. That company can add their own services for their customers. We think all of the cloud companies in Japan are going to adopt OCI, plus a lot of big companies, the big car companies in Japan will want their own.\nThe phone companies in Japan will want their own. The technology companies in Japan will want their own Oracle regions because they're sovereign, because they're highly secure, and because they're highly cost-effective. We think this allows us to enter a variety of new markets. Pretty much every government is going to want a sovereign cloud and a dedicated region for that government, not only so we see a number of countries. It's funny, we talk about winning business with companies. For the first time, we're beginning to win business for countries, for sovereign clouds, where the national government and the state governments are moving to that Oracle OCI region.\nOf course, it's got to be at least two of them for redundancy in case of disaster recovery. We have a number of countries where we're negotiating sovereign regions with the national government. We see that time and time again, major companies, governments, computer suppliers reselling our Alloy Cloud. The demand for our cloud regions is extraordinarily high. I believe we will end up, well, this is a funny prediction, but okay, we'll end up with more data centers in cloud regions than all the other hyperscalers combined.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYes, I think so.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nThat's what I believe.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nJust to make sure you have all the numbers, between Alloy and dedicated regions, we've got 13 live, 18 under construction, and we've signed five new ones just this past quarter. For us, there's just a list we're going through and trying to get them all because they are such a unique capability, and in such high demand.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nLet me just add one last thing. Microsoft does not compete for this business, AWS does not compete for this business, and Google does not compete for this business. We're the only ones in this business.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today comes from Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks very much for taking my question. Larry, my question actually follows on your answer to Kirk's question because I think it's so important. In talking to one of your GSI partners, we heard about a global public sector solution that they referred to as Government-in-a-Box, where Oracle in partnership with the likes of Starlink, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, are building solutions on top of OCI, including Apps and Tech and even Cerner, to literally run entire countries' digital operations. Hoping you can add even a little bit more color about what you're doing here, how big an opportunity it is, because it just seems like such a powerful example of the entire Oracle Cloud stack coming together in a very meaningful way.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, it is very interesting. We've gone into the national government and state government applications in a very, very big way. To give you an idea, a little glimpse of what we're doing, yes, because we can deliver these cloud regions to medium-sized countries. For example, Serbia is standardizing on these Oracle Cloud regions for the national government. We're automating their healthcare, and people know that we're in the healthcare business. What they might not know is, in cooperation with Starlink, we're able to deliver an internet service for the entire country, the rural part of the country.\nBy the way, we can deliver the internet, and we have delivered the internet to, let's say, Kenya or Rwanda, very inexpensively using Starlink and our sovereign cloud regions to backhaul the internet traffic. You can bring every school in Serbia online. It has internet connectivity. Even if they're rural, it doesn't matter. Every school, every hospital. It's true of Rwanda, that's true of Kenya. We can do it very, very cost-effectively.\nOne of the applications we have for agriculture, we actually do a national map of the country where we can show you each of the farms in the country, what they're, this farm is growing coffee, this farm is growing maize, this farm, which part of the fields are getting enough nitrogen, which part of the fields are getting enough water, what corrective actions you need to take to increase your agricultural output.\nWe're doing that again in concert with Elon Musk and SpaceX to do this kind of mapping to provide this AI-assisted, and then these maps are AI-assisted, help them plan their agricultural output and predict their agricultural output, predict markets, the logistics of the agricultural output, doing all of those things as next-generation national applications. It is one of the most exciting things we're doing. Of course, we do procurement, accounting, human resources, and recruiting for the government. We do all of those applications.\nIn some of the newer applications regarding food security, making sure all the schools are online, rural schools are online, that rural hospitals are online, it's automating those rural hospitals. It's automating their vaccination program, their healthcare program across the board. These next-generation applications are very attractive. I'll tell you one other crazy thing that we do, another generative AI application. If you want to join the EU, it took Serbia eight years to harmonize their laws to be able to join the EU. Albania is facing the same thing.\nWith generative AI, we can read the entire corpus of the Albanian laws and actually harmonize their laws with the EU in probably more like 18 months to two years rather than the eight years it took Serbia. There are all sorts of interesting new AI applications out there that people you've probably never heard of before. At least I hadn't heard of before until this last 12 months that we've worked on, and we're now in the process of delivering.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nReally amazing stuff, Larry. Thank you. Congrats and Safra. Really great to see the firm reiteration of your fiscal 2026 targets. Thanks so much for taking my question.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Brad. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Krista for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nWith that."

My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oracle Corporation second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question during that time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Ken Bond, you may begin your conference.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our investor relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our investor relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K, 10-Q, and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, Cloud services and license support, is now 74% of the revenue, it's recurring revenue, and it's the one growing by a billion dollars this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen, it's happening. As this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year. To that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just three years ago, OCI was rarely, if ever, mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built, we kept talking about it, and we knew it was only a matter of time.\nMore industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for strategic cloud platform services. Our financial results reflect that customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads, given our unique differentiation and price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things. Creating the second-generation cloud enabled us to build a much better, more scalable, and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently. Second, we know what it takes to run at enterprise scale performance and security better than I say anyone else.\nOur 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission-critical systems. Third, we recognized that customers need deployment flexibility. Rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors, we are the only vendor which also offers dedicated cloud to customer, dedicated region, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner clouds. Finally, our belief in the importance of multi-cloud offerings will be industry-changing as these collaborations roll out. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out. Now to the Q2 results. With total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and EPS at the high end of guidance. As a reminder, currency was one point less helpful than when we gave guidance three months ago.\nTotal cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS excluding Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50%, and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database, and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion, and we're up 19%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 55%, with an annualized revenue of $6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 71%.\nDatabase subscription revenues, which includes database license support, were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata database cloud services revenue, which was up 40%, and autonomous database, up 26%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS, and Gen2 OCI. Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year, where it was up 23%. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4%, including Cerner, actually up 6%, excluding Cerner. Now shifting to margins, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 78%. This is because of the mix between support and cloud, in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS margins are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially.\nWhile we continue to build data center capacity, gross margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To this point, the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 10% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 7% from last year. The operating margin was 43%, up from 41% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34, up 11% in USD, and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.89.\nAt quarter end, we had nearly $8.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 1%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17 billion, up 13%, and free cash flow was $10.1 billion, up 20%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion over the same period as we continue to seek cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11% in constant currency. We continue to sign large deals, with many in the pipeline. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs.\nGiven the enormity of our pipeline and backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring online more capacity. To that point, we now have 66 customer-facing cloud regions live, with 45 public cloud regions around the world, and another 6 being built. Twelve of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, and starting next year, customers will be able to run Oracle Database at Azure on OCI inside Azure. We also have 10 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, 9 national security regions, and 2 EU sovereign regions live, with increasing demand for more of each. Finally, we have 7 Alloy Cloud regions planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. Of course, we also have so many, many, many cloud customer installations.\nThe sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be advantages for us in the marketplace. Finally, as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million, and, in addition, we paid out dividends of $4.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I will review, as always, on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, the actual currency impact may be different.\nBecause of that, all the numbers I give you are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8. Total revenues, excluding Cerner, are expected to grow from 8% to 10. Total cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 26% to 28. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.35 and $1.39. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Finally, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal 2026 financial goals for revenue, operating margins, and EPS growth. With that, let me turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Safra. The demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure and generative AI is consistently increasing quarter after quarter. Oracle's total remaining performance obligations, or RPO, has now reached $65 billion, slightly more than our annual revenue. In response to this sharply increasing demand, Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud data centers and building 100 new cloud data centers. We have to build 100 additional cloud data centers because there are billions of dollars more in contracted demand than we currently can supply. Cloud infrastructure demand is huge and growing at an unprecedented rate. In the next few weeks, we expect to sign a couple more billion-dollar cloud infrastructure contracts. Gartner recently named Oracle OCI as a leader in cloud platform infrastructure services.\nThe demand for cloud infrastructure services and new Oracle Cloud data centers is broad-based, driven not only by generative AI customers, but also by nation-states buying Safra and Oracle Cloud data centers, plus large banks, telecommunications companies, and industrial companies buying dedicated cloud data centers, dedicated Oracle Cloud data centers. Perhaps most interestingly, demand from other hyperscalers and other cloud service providers co-locating and connecting their clouds with Oracle Cloud data centers. Customers do not want clouds to be walled gardens. In the next few months, we will turn on 20 new Oracle Cloud data centers co-located with and connected to Microsoft Azure as a part of our joint multi-cloud initiative. These 20 new multi-cloud data centers will house over 2,000 full racks of Exadata database machines designed to meet pent-up demand for the Oracle Cloud database.\nWe're able to build new data centers rapidly and operate them inexpensively because all of our data centers are architecturally identical, highly automated, with an identical high-performance RDMA network, autonomous services, and applications. Oracle Cloud data centers vary only by scale. Several nation-states have ordered multiple sovereign data centers to be built within their country so that they can move their government, healthcare, and commercial workloads to the Oracle Cloud. These new countries include Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and others. Some of the world's largest banks, telecommunications, and industrial companies have also contracted with us to build Oracle Cloud data centers dedicated entirely to them so that they can migrate their workloads to an Oracle Cloud data center. These companies include Nomura, Vodafone, Telecom Italia Mobile, Saudi Telecom, a huge Korean conglomerate, and a huge US defense contractor.\nThese are but a few examples that demonstrate the diversity of the growing demand for Oracle's highly differentiated Gen2 cloud infrastructure and data center technology. Back to you, Ken.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Larry. Emma, if we could please poll the audience for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, press the star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your first question today comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks a lot. It's great to be speaking with you this afternoon. Do you mind going through your thoughts on the OCI trajectory from here, and how you feel backlog will play out into revenue? Perhaps you can comment also, is the acceleration potential that you guided forward due to getting more GPUs and more AI backlog moving into revenue? Thanks a lot.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLarry, you want me to take it or you?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nNo, either one, Safra. You tell me.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nHow would I get started? Where do we expect OCI to go from here? Frankly, the only limiting factor is our ability to get the data centers, hand it over, and filled up fast enough. This quarter alone, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that we would have been able to recognize if our capacity was available. The reality is, as we roll out, and we've got just so many moving parts, as you can hear from us, we have a lot of capacity coming online. As you can see in my CapEx guidance, we expect OCI to just grow astronomically, frankly. It is the ideal infrastructure for so much use. Of course, also as more GPUs become available and we can put those in, we have just a really unlimited amount of demand.\nLarry, I don't know if you want to say anything else.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, again, in the next few weeks, I mentioned we're going to sign two additional contracts right around $1 billion each. I mean, the backlog is growing astronomically. I think it's the word Safra used, and that's accurate. There's no reason why OCI grew 50% this quarter. I think OCI is going to get much bigger, and actually, the growth rate will be above 50%, I believe, as these data centers come online. We think we can build a lot of these data centers very quickly. By the way, again, I emphasize, it's not just GenAI demand. There is huge pent-up cloud database demand. There is huge demand overseas for sovereign clouds, where governments haven't been able to move their workloads. A lot of those are government Oracle workloads. They haven't been able to move their workloads to the cloud.\nI mean, there are literally, I don't know, five, six, seven large companies in Japan that will be building at least two data centers, Oracle data centers each. The demand is extraordinary. We can build the data centers relatively fast, and I expect the OCI growth rate to be over 50% for a few years.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYes, we're not demand limited in any way right now.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director, Melius Research\n\nThanks a lot, Safra and Larry. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nSure. Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Thanks for the question. Thanks, Larry, for those comments on the future OCI growth. Since Ben asked about the growth, maybe I'll take a step back on the other part of all this, and that's the profit side. Per Larry's comments, you're building out a lot of capacity, and Safra's comments agree with that with the CapEx growth. Clay's also spoken about the time it takes to build out those AI superclusters. I know that's not the only AI workloads you're doing, but that sounds like some pretty exciting stuff. It takes time before you get revenue. I realize you're also seeing ramp-up of those, what I'll call, core OCI deals like Uber, and you actually get revenue from them over time. How should we think about cloud gross margins over time in this context with both those things?\nThere's a lot happening here.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYes. I'm really glad you asked. I'm really glad you asked because one of the lines that we show you, even though I give you more detail, is I show you a number that is a mix of cloud and support. Obviously, support is extremely profitable because of the structure of the way it works, and because we are at such a large scale. The reality is that our cloud businesses are also very profitable. Our SaaS cloud business is very profitable, and our OCI business is improving profitability as it grows. The target gross margins for it are much higher than I think you expect because you're probably comparing it to some of the more pure-play cloud folks who somehow don't end up making as much money in all of this. As we grow, our gross margin percentage goes up.\nYes, we make a lot of investments, and we'll be making a lot of investments, but our profitability continues to go up because once the worst moment is at the moment where the data center is full of computers and you don't have any tenants that first day, but that's not actually how we work. Yes, we have the floor space, but we grow in pieces. Unlike some of the others that have to do a full-out build-out and put everything there before they have a penny of revenue, that's not how we work. More and more of our, so we start small and build up, and that allows us to match our spending with the revenues much better. That's because we have that engineering deployment flexibility that the first-generation folks don't have. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah, I do. I think one thing is very important. We're much more highly automated than the older data centers. To give you an idea, to run Oracle Cloud, we have to keep track of all of our customers, how much they're using. We have to have a variety of databases and applications that run the cloud. Those databases are all the Autonomous Database. We have no labor associated with those databases. It's all completely automated. Our installations, when we bring up a new cloud, you plug it in, and the process of bringing it up is largely automated. There aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to bring it up, and there certainly aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to run it every day. We focus on autonomous services. Our Linux, our operating system, is fully autonomous.\nThere's no labor associated with running it. There's certainly labor associated with building the software, but not running the software. It doesn't cost us more to run 100 data centers than it costs us to run 10 in terms of data DBAs, or people running Oracle Autonomous Linux. We have a very different model than our old data centers or our competitors' data centers. We can run these things, we can bring them up relatively quickly, and we can run them very inexpensively and efficiently. One last thing about being autonomous, the fact that it's automated. There are far fewer errors, and there are far fewer security vulnerabilities because the system is completely self-driving.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nIf I might, Safra, go back to something you said. Is it fair to assume that OCI gross margins have consistently grown over time, quarter to quarter?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYes.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nOkay. Then.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYes is it.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nGrown a lot.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nGrown a lot. Okay. What Larry just said about the database, Safra, I've heard you say at times, we're at the beginning of the beginning of the transition of the database to cloud. I know you have database in cloud today, but that migration of the on-prem, that's still to come very much.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. It is really still to come. We're talking about tens of billions of dollars when it comes over. It's starting to come, but we haven't been in the place to receive it all en masse. Customers have to get comfortable with it. Also, multi-cloud has to really roll out, and that's going to be another piece of it. Customers are going to have so many excellent choices. They can go in the public cloud, they can go in OCI, they can go in their cloud to customer, they can go in OCI at Azure as one possibility. It is the absolute beginning because remember, the Oracle Database is not a toy. It's a mission-critical system. If it just disappeared at companies, the whole planet would come to a standstill. This is coming, and it's just the beginning.\nYou see what's going on with OCI. No one believed us. This was possible. Now here we're at. Right behind it is going to come the database, and that's going to be something.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nPer Larry's comments, and I'll stop talking, but per Larry's comments, the database gross margins, given the autonomous nature of it, we should expect that to be different than the OCI core infrastructure as a service gross margin.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYes, absolutely. The database.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nI don't want to go into detail, but the autonomous database is, one, autonomous. There's no labor associated with it. It's also the only database that's fully elastic. In other words, if you're not using it, no one's using it. I mean, there are no cores. There's no cores occupied. It goes back into the pool. If you as a customer aren't doing something with the database, literally, no cores are occupied. It's very different than an Amazon database where you allocate. I always need 64 cores or 64 processors to run my database, and that's 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. We only charge you for what you use when you're using it. We only consume what you use when you're using it. Otherwise, it goes to other customers. It's totally different. That allows us to have dramatically higher gross margins.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you very much. Sorry for the several-part question, but thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOur pleasure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much for taking the question. I really appreciate it. I want to change gears a little bit and turn to Cerner, which people don't really focus on that much. Cerner license revenue has been down, likely in preparation for customers shifting to SaaS, but Oracle does not yet have a full multi-tenant, scalable Cerner SaaS solution. What I'd like to ask is a couple of parts. How should we think about the timing of, one, the availability of.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThat's not correct.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYep.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThat's not correct.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOh, okay.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nCerner has several pieces. I believe about half the customers will be moved, half of the Millennium customers. You can think of Cerner as just automating hospitals like Epic. That's a product called Millennium, and about half of those customers will move to OCI by February. Half of all existing customers will be in Oracle OCI. We've also developed something that began at Cerner, and we have finished. Now, we've completely rewritten it. Well, we're in the process. We will finish next calendar year. It is largely rewritten and available right now. Something called our Health Data Intelligence Platform. It was known as Cerner's Health Intent. That's for public health. That's for population-scale public health management. Again, it's sold to US states, Australian states, and European countries. It's for managing population health.\nRemember during COVID when we didn't know, New York thought they were running out of hospital rooms, but they really weren't, but no one knew because no one kept track of our inventory of hospital rooms. There was no national view. No one knew how many people contracted COVID yesterday. We didn't have that national view. We have that national view. It is fully SaaS, and it is available right now. Some of the pieces, some of the Cerner pieces are coming online. Other Cerner pieces are moving more gradually, but they're all going into OCI, and they are all, and they are all very quickly moving from a license basis to a subscription basis.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThat's very helpful. That starts to answer the question I was asking, which was, how should we think about the timing of the transition? Millennium, you're saying, is going to be in OCI. Is that going to be a fully SaaS version? When will the rest of the solutions be fully SaaS, and how should we think about the revenue lift as the license and maintenance moves to the cloud, to SaaS?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nSo, it will, it will be fully in OCI and SaaS, but it will not be the new. We are replacing Millennium a piece at a time, not a big lift and shift, but we are upgrading and modernizing Millennium a piece at a time. Different pieces will be available starting next year. Cerner customers will be getting new features and capabilities as a part of Millennium as Millennium moves to OCI. Again, half the customers will be in OCI by February. We're making a lot of progress. At the same time, we're adding a lot of new products to Millennium, like the public health products. We're also adding much new products for pharmaceutical companies. We're adding additional products for hospitals to keep track of their inventory, for hospitals to manage their workforce.\nReally, what we think of is our health division in Oracle has products for the entire healthcare ecosystems: payers, including governments, including insurance companies, providers, including ambulatory clinics and hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, research companies, and public health departments in national governments and state governments. We have products for the entire healthcare ecosystem, which is a much larger footprint than Cerner ever had. We are going after a much larger market than Cerner was. We expect Cerner to be a growth story. I guess that's what I'm getting at.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nRight. That's where I'm going with the question.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. Let me just tell you, I think for the year, for the full fiscal year, Cerner will be sort of -1 to 2 points, but that will be it. It'll end this fiscal year, and from then on, it will be a growth story. It will no longer be a drag on Oracle growth. Okay?\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nPerfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. That was very helpful.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nGreat.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThanks for taking my question. Larry and Safra, many mission-critical workloads still run on Oracle Database, and you have a sticky maintenance revenues team. We expect Oracle will start migrating those database workloads to OCI, which will bring 3x revenue uplift, which you call even the third leg of cloud growth. You also have now OCI inside Azure data center. My question is, how does this being multi-cloud change your outlook for Oracle Database? What are you hearing from your database customer in terms of their comfort and preparedness to move their Oracle Database to the cloud, either OCI or Azure?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLarry, why don't you start?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nSafra, you want me to go first?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nNo, yes, I do. You go.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks. Our customers are very happy with the idea. Remember, Oracle started as one of the first databases that ran everywhere. We ran on IBM mainframes, we ran on personal computers, we ran on Digital Equipment, if you remember them, mini computers, and HP mini computers. We ran on every operating system on every computer. Now, in cloud, they're very happy to see that they can not only get the Oracle Database at OCI, they can also get the identical capability from Microsoft. We are building data centers for Microsoft inside Azure. Microsoft, it wasn't us that decided 2,000 was the right number of Exadata machines to install in those 20 data centers. That was Microsoft. The demand is enormous. Our customers want the same flexibility they've always had with Oracle. They want to use Oracle, they want to transition.\nIf they're using the Microsoft cloud, they want to run the best, latest, and greatest version of Oracle in the Microsoft cloud. They'd want to do that in other clouds as well. Some of them, it is very important to have it in Japan, for example. It's very important for some of that data to remain in Japan. One of the things the Oracle Database does is it runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It does that in a dedicated data center run by Nomura Research, who supplies financial services and Oracle Gen2 OCI services to the Japanese market. There are a number of other partners in Japan that are going that same direction. In Japan, they used to buy the Oracle Database from Nomura, or they used to buy it from Fujitsu, or they bought it from Hitachi, or they bought it from NEC.\nThey want that Oracle Database. It is quite natural for all of those companies to have their own dedicated regions of OCI and sell to their, and support their customers out of those regions. That's the flexibility we allow. That's something that nobody else can do. We can build these regions for our partners. We can build these regions for sovereign states. We can build these regions for large companies that don't want their data commingled with anyone else's data. They want a public cloud. They want a full OCI. They want every part of OCI, but they don't want anyone else in their region. They want it to be theirs, and theirs alone. We can do that. Nobody else can.\nNext question, please.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThank you, Larry.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLet me summarize. That means literally any way you want to get Oracle. Any way you want to get Oracle, you'll be able to get it. It'll be a little bit back to the future. And we think the impact on database demand, we're seeing it already. Let me close with 2,000 exit data racks. That's a stunning number in terms of how many customers you can put on that. That's tens of thousands of customers you can put on that much hardware.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThanks, Larry, for the color.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThat's Microsoft alone. Okay.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Your line is open.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask around some of the GenAI functionality inside of the applications portfolio, specifically Fusion and NetSuite. Any update or uptick that you're seeing or can share around some of your partnerships around Cohere, maybe any early feedback from the field that informs incremental value capture, whether or not it's starting to resonate either in the form of increased migration activity, increased market share gains, or increased monetization opportunities around the application portfolio?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, we're using it every place. Perhaps the most stunning is our new telecommunications. Again, I mentioned to Cerner earlier that we're doing a lot of things that Cerner never did, what is now called Oracle Health. One of those things is our new telecommunication module summarizes a consultation between a doctor and a patient and writes the doctor's notes for the doctor automatically. In fact, for the first time, we've done it. We now have our large language model generating the summary without a scribe that the doctor can edit in a couple of minutes. So it's actually succeeded in doing one of the very hardest, one of the very hardest tasks we assigned it. Of course, we're using everything from as simple as doing product descriptions or job descriptions, all of those. You've read about all of those.\nWe've actually got those implemented and are delivering those to customers. But even some of the most challenging areas in drug design, we're having success with pharmaceutical companies. But actually writing the doctor's notes without a scribe has shocked a great many people. And well, another area in terms of diagnosing cancer from biopsy, just biopsy images, being able to do that very, very quickly where the patient knows weeks sooner than they would otherwise know. They get the news weeks sooner from just the immediate AI processing of the biopsy image. They find out weeks sooner whether they have to go on chemotherapy or whether they're cancer-free. And we're doing that with an Israeli partner called Imaging.\nNow we're seeing a huge uptake of this technology, everything from complex healthcare and health science to more mundane tasks that you find throughout an enterprise, but still very important in making your employees and your company more efficient and more competitive.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. And then from a monetization standpoint, is this a monetizing in a copilot way, similar to Microsoft, or how do you envision ultimately seeing some of the incremental value capture inside of the model?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, we think inside of our remember, we're a little bit different than Microsoft. We have a lot more enterprise applications, for example, in healthcare. We run clinical trials. We run hospitals. We run ambulatory clinics. We have diagnostic databases for image processing databases, conventional blood testing databases, all of those. So our monetization is really at the highest end of the value chain, which is we actually supply the application with our partner that does cancer diagnosis, that does the doctor's notes, that does the doctor's orders, that actually automatically generates the prescriptions, that reminds the patient to take the subscription so you get compliance. Right now, I don't want to spend too much time on it. Right now, doctors don't know if patients have refilled their prescriptions. The doctors aren't notified, and the patients aren't notified. Reminding them. We're doing all of that.\nWe're doing a bunch of things with, and that's the high end. That's the high value end of AI when you're preventing someone from being re-hospitalized, which has a huge cost in terms of human suffering and money.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nNow, we have multiple ways, by the way, to monetize it, not only as part of our applications, but also as part of our infrastructure. Because one of the unique capabilities we allow is for customers, when they use our products, to basically use their private data in some of these models for them to learn, but then to ultimately keep control of their data. And this is applicable in many, many different types of applications. And this is a service we provide in addition. So there's just a lot.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nSafra's making a very good point in that we have our own applications in healthcare, but we have partners and other companies that come to us to use our AI to enrich their applications. And we keep their data private and allow them to enrich their applications. That company I mentioned earlier, Imaging, that's not our application that does the cancer diagnosis. That's an Israeli company that's doing that. But they're using our AI to develop their healthcare application. So we monetize through Imaging, enabling them to build their AI application. And we also build a lot of our own. So of course, Safra is right. It's a combination of the two.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question today comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Larry, it's taken Oracle several years to reach 66 cloud data centers. You're now talking about plans to build 100 new ones, which frankly seems very ambitious. What is it that you're seeing that maybe we don't see? Then related, perhaps, Safra, if you could speak to the capital requirements and timeframe for that, especially in light of CapEx this quarter that was a bit less than we had expected. Thank you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, okay. How about Microsoft puts in an order for 20 cloud data centers? That's what we're seeing. When one company, as you say, we have 60. By the way, that's a little bit misplaced. That's not quite right. I mean, we have 66 cloud regions. We sometimes use those synonymously. They're not always that data center and regions don't necessarily translate one to one.\nBut yeah, when someone comes along and orders 20, then that creates a lot of opportunity for us to build more data centers and get more OCI customers because we're building OCI data centers inside of the Azure Cloud. So those are the kinds of things we're seeing. We're building our own public regions based on direct customer demand. And then we're building partner regions like the 20 data centers for Microsoft. The combination of the two adds up to 100.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. And also, one of the things is in that number, it doesn't include the many, many cloud customers, which started small, and now companies have decided they want their own region. So they had a cloud customer, which is smaller, and they decide, \"No, no, no. Now I want a dedicated region of my own.\" I get it. This is working. I've saved millions, tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions. Now I want my own. Also, really, it is absolutely true.\nWe did not bring up as much capacity as we could have used this past quarter because we had to make some audible calls on the field to decide how to allocate, whether to build something small, which was available, which I could have recognized revenue in right in the quarter, or instead to go much bigger and to wait until some larger capacity was going to be available to hand over to me. As I think I've hinted, and we're talking about demand, had we had capacity this quarter in the hundreds of millions of dollars more that was just sitting there waiting to take it, and we had made some deployment choices because we need more and we need it bigger.\nInstead of taking small pieces or smaller pieces, we decided to focus on the bigger parts and try to also treat our customers fairly and work with them to meet their needs.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLet me give you one example of that, what Safra is describing, is we got enough NVIDIA GPUs for Elon Musk's company, XAI, to bring up the first version, the first available version of their large language model called Grok. They got that up and running. But boy, did they want a lot more. Boy, did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them. We gave them quite a few, but they wanted more, and we are in the process of getting them more. So the demand, we got that up pretty quickly. They were able to use it, but they want dramatically more as there's this gold rush towards building the world's greatest large language model. And we are doing our best to give our customers what we can this quarter and then dramatically increase our ability to give them more and more capacity each succeeding quarter.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks very much.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay. Thank you, Brad. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Emma for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect."

Today's call is being recorded, and now I would like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison and Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.

Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, 22 years ago today was a traumatic day for our country. Like many of you, it feels like yesterday when the country lost nearly 3,000 souls, and we at Oracle, we lost 11 employees. I remember exactly where I was when the tragedy unfolded, and it is still so hard speaking about it, even all these years later. Today, we honor and remember each one of the victims and heroes, and we hope that their memories are a blessing to all of us. Now, before I go to our Q1 numbers, I thought it would help to start with some of the things that are going on at Oracle that you'll be hearing about over the next couple of weeks.\nNext week, we have Oracle Cloud World, which will showcase the latest innovations, including AI on OCI, the progress of Oracle Autonomous Database, our multi-cloud strategy, the use of Oracle Analytics throughout our portfolio to drive better decision-making, and the use of generative AI to differentiate Fusion, NetSuite, and our industry application. Cloud World is our marquee event each year, where current and prospective customers take time out of their busy calendars to join us in person and share their experiences. We know that there are no better spokespeople for our products and services than our existing customers. Our innovation results directly from our development teams interacting with customers to anticipate and build the next generation of products and services. Some of the customers you will hear from next week include NVIDIA, Uber, Ascension Health, Cohere, and many, many, many, many more.\nYou'll also hear from our expanding set of strategic partners that are driving the Oracle ecosystem, and this includes Amdocs, VMware, and Microsoft. Overall, it's remarkable the interest we are getting from the ISV community to work with Oracle. There are a lot of discussions going on, and you will see more announcements shortly. From a financial standpoint, we see this customer and partner ecosystem as a leading indicator of our income statement. I've been talking with you about our revenue acceleration for some time now. In Q1, our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, climbed to nearly $65 billion US dollars, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11%. We have now signed several deals for OCI, greater than $1 billion US dollars in total value. In the first week of Q2, we booked an additional $1.5 billion US dollars in business, which isn't even included in the Q1 numbers.\nApproximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. My point here is that customer momentum is continuing to build. This momentum is turning into bookings, and that gives me the confidence that our annual revenue growth will continue to accelerate moving forward. Now to the Q1 results, which I remind you I am announcing on day 11, only because day 8, when we were ready, was a Friday, and I know none of you like that. This quarter, we saw a modest currency tailwind, but as always, I'll discuss our financials using constant currency growth rates. Clearly, Q1 was another great quarter, with total revenue at the midpoint of guidance, earnings per share $0.02 US dollars above the high end of guidance, and our cloud growth was 29%. Total cloud revenue, SaaS and IS excluding Cerner, was $4 billion US dollars, up 29%.\nNow, including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 29% also, at $4.6 billion US dollars, with our IS revenue at $1.5 billion US dollars, up 64%, and SaaS revenue of $3.1 billion US dollars, up 17%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.5 billion US dollars, up 12%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support, were $4.5 billion US dollars, up 11%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $6.9 billion US dollars, and they grew 20%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.1 billion US dollars, up 14%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 64%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen 2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 72%, with an annualized revenue of $5.6 billion US dollars. OCI consumption revenue was up 91%. Exadata Cloud Services revenue was up 46%, and Autonomous Database was up 42%.\nDatabase subscription services, which includes license support, were up 6%, highlighted by Cloud Database Services, which were up 44%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these Cloud Database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen 2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenues were $0.8 billion US dollars, down 11%, following an amazing Q1 last year of 19% growth, which made it a tough compare this year. In all, total revenue for the quarter were $12.4 billion US dollars, up 8%, including Cerner, up 9%, excluding Cerner. Shifting to margins, the gross margins for cloud services and license support were 78%, with IS gross margins improving substantially from last year. While we've continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our IS margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up.\nWe monitor our expenses very carefully to ensure our gross margin percentages expand as we scale up. To this point, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 9% in Q1. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion US dollars, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 41%, up from 39% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19 in US dollars, up 16% in US dollars, up 14% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.86 in US dollars. At quarter end, we had nearly $12.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $11.1 billion US dollars, up 5%.\nOperating cash flow for the first quarter was up 9% to $7 billion US dollars, while free cash flow was up 21% to $5.7 billion US dollars, and I expect that we will see very good results in our free cash flow for the rest of the year. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.7 billion US dollars, up 68%, and free cash flow was $9.5 billion US dollars, up 76%. Capital expenditures were $8.3 billion US dollars over the last four quarters, and we're clearly beginning to see the cash flow benefits stemming from our cloud transformation. CapEx was $1.3 billion US dollars in Q1 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the demand we have and see in the pipeline, I expect the fiscal year 2024 CapEx will be similar to this past year's CapEx.\nAs always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud business. We now have 64 cloud regions live, with 44 public cloud regions around the world and another six being built. Twelve of these public cloud regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure. We also have nine dedicated regions live and eleven more planned, nine security regions, and twelve EU sovereign regions live, with increasing demand for more of each. Of course, we have many, many cloud customer implementations. The cost advantages, sizing flexibility, and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continue to make us so compelling in the marketplace to customers. As we've said many, many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend.\nThis quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for a total of $150 million US dollars. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.9 billion US dollars over the last 12 months, and the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 US dollars per share. Now, before I dive into Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see longer term. Per my earlier remarks, we have a great line of sight into the trajectory of the business, given the bookings momentum. We are extremely confident about our revenue acceleration for the year, even though in any quarter there may be small fluctuations. Because we have far more demand than we can supply, our biggest challenge is building data centers as quickly as possible. In addition, we are in an accelerated transition of Cerner to the cloud.\nThis transition is resulting in some near-term headwinds to the Cerner growth rate as customers move from license purchases, which are recognized upfront, to cloud subscriptions, which are recognized ratably. Excluding Cerner, I remain committed to accelerating our total revenue growth rate this fiscal year, as well as maintaining our current high cloud growth rates for the year. As you will hear at our financial analyst meeting next week, we remain firmly committed to our fiscal 2026 financial goals. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 2% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.03 US dollars positive effect on EPS in Q2. However, the actual currency impact may be different. Here we go.\nTotal revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in constant currency, and are expected to grow 5% to 7% in US dollars at today's rates. Total revenue, excluding Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency, and expected to grow 8% to 10% in US dollars. Total cloud revenue, excluding Cerner—again, I give you these numbers so you can see the main line business—is expected to grow from 27% to 29% in constant currency, and is expected to grow 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 5% and 9%, and be between $1.27 US dollars and $1.31 US dollars in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 7% to 11%, and be between $1.30 and $1.34 in US dollars. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Safra. Is generative AI the most important new computer technology ever? Maybe. We're about to find out. Self-driving cars, computer-designed antiviral drugs, voice user interfaces. Generative AI is changing the automobile industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and how people communicate with their computers. Generative AI is changing everything. As of today, AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion US dollars of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud. That's twice as much AI training as we had booked at the end of the last Q4. I'm also very pleased to announce that XAI has signed a contract to do training in Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud. The largest AI technology companies and the leading AI startups continue to expand their business with Oracle for one simple reason.\nOracle's RDMA interconnected NVIDIA superclusters train AI models at twice the speed and much less than half the cost of other clouds. Growth in our AI cloud infrastructure business is not the only exciting news we have to report at Oracle. Our cloud applications business is doing quite well, and it's about to get even better. In the current quarter, we expect our Cerner health business to be awarded two large new contracts with a total value of over $1 billion US dollars. I'm now able to announce that all nine utility companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway are in the process of replacing all their existing ERP systems and standardizing on Oracle's Fusion Cloud applications. Let me conclude with a few words about our database business and our upcoming announcement with Microsoft later this week.\nWe will be substantially expanding our existing multi-cloud partnership with Microsoft by making it easier for Microsoft Azure customers to buy and use the latest Oracle Cloud Database technology in combination with Microsoft Azure Cloud services. Satya and I will discuss the details of our expanding partnership at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond on 14th. Please tune in. Thank you. Back to you, Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Larry. Maybe, Ken, we could start taking questions at this point.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nAbsolutely. Before we do that, Lisa, just one quick clarification that we currently have two EU sovereign regions live, with more to come. Lisa, please pull the audience for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question on the phone lines today, that is star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, to remove yourself from the queue, it is star one again. We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnik with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks very much, and congrats on the strong start to the year. Larry, I think it's fair to say you understand the laws of data gravity better than anyone, and you've monetized this fundamental concept as well as anyone over the years. I recently heard someone say we're moving from a world of data gravity to one of AI gravity. I'm not sure exactly what that means or if they even knew what that meant. With AI, another use case is attracting more and more data to central clouds, with many vendors preaching data sharing instead of what used to be making multiple copies of things and keeping them synchronized. Does AI plus Cloud in any way break what we've always understood about data gravity? What does that mean for Oracle?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, you can't build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. If anything, what generative AI has shown is that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting this vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster. It is a huge data problem in the sense you need so much data. To train OpenAI, to train ChatGPT 3.5, they read the entire public internet. They read all of Wikipedia. They read everything. They ingested everything. To specialize, you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it. You need specialized training data from electronic health records to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let's say. We have partners, Imagine, for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models.\nWe have Veronica, another partner of ours in AI, ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn't work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data. In terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravity to AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillions of elements went into building ChatGPT 3.5, multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0, because you had to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train image recognition. We think this is very good for our database business.\nOracle's new vector database will contain highly specialized training data like electronic health records while keeping that data anonymized and private, yet still training the specialized models that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer, heart disease, and all sorts of other diseases. We think it's a boon to our business, and we are now getting into the deep water of the information age. Nothing has changed about that. The demands on data are getting stronger and more important.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you so much for your perspective, Larry.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you so much. Larry, companies are starting to understand that OCI has a very fundamentally different architecture than anything else out there on the market because of the non-blocking, low-latency network design. I'm wondering if you think it's possible to actually pull farther ahead through some of your other initiatives. For instance, the Azure interconnect, it sounds like you're going to expand that, having more regions, running a stronger database, providing greater isolation. Just wondering if you think there's a possibility of extending the lead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, again, we're on our second generation of data center and our second generation of cloud. A lot of people noticed that we were a little bit late to the party, but that's because we moved from a generation, which we were not very happy with, to a second generation, which we think solved a lot of problems that the other cloud companies have not yet solved. The non-blocking, ultrafast RDMA network is not only useful for training AI models, it's useful for almost everything. It's certainly useful for building a much faster database. It's useful in terms of the automation level we have in our data centers. Our data centers are 100% automated. They configure themselves. They run themselves. We don't have a lot of labor. That saves us a huge amount of money. A lot of labor cost is saved.\nThe biggest advantage is if you don't have human beings involved, you don't have human labor, you don't have human errors, you don't have mistakes. You can ensure security. Most security problems are caused by people that make mistakes, or people that engage in mischief. We don't have that in our data center. That's another huge advantage. Our data centers are, because they're identical, the only way we could automate them was to make them all the same, and they vary only by scale. There are big ones and small ones, but they're identical. They all have the same hardware pieces, and the same software pieces. They all have the same automation. That automation allows us to put these data centers in very small countries. We expect to have many, many more data centers than any other cloud provider. We also put those data centers at customers.\nNomura Research, NRI, which resells Oracle Cloud capacity in Japan, has two dedicated regions and are building two more. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I don't know of any clouds that are running stock exchanges other than ours. It's because of the extreme reliability and security that we get with all of the automation that's included with our data center. We have cost advantages, performance advantages, and security advantages. That's why we're growing much faster than any of the other hyperscalers.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Raymond Lenzchao with Barclays Capital.\n\nRaymond Lenzchao\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Capital\n\nThank you. Larry, you mentioned Berkshire and then moving over to Fusion. I just wanted to talk more in a bigger picture on the back office systems. Like in the olden days, back office, you wouldn't touch in kind of tougher times because they are big, complex projects. You guys are still kind of growing this nicely with over 20%. What are you seeing there? Do you see a change in pipelines, a change in customer interest of doing something there? Thank you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, the back office in the cloud is very different than the back office on-premise. We have a big advantage that we are by far and away the biggest, I don't know, 95% of the cloud ERP market in terms of actual live customers using it. We have an important partnership with JPMorgan Chase. We'll be announcing some more partnerships in the financial community at the upcoming CloudWorld, where we automate a lot of e-commerce, B2B e-commerce right in the cloud. What is B2B e-commerce between two Oracle Cloud customers, two Oracle ERP Cloud customers? It's one Oracle procurement system talking to another Oracle order management system and financing the transaction through their bank. We automate that entirely in the cloud. If your bank is JPMorgan Chase, they originate the loan right along with your purchase.\nIt's e-commerce for B2B with banking, shipping, and insurance all included and rolled together. We've done a great job as an industry automating e-commerce for B2C. I mean, Amazon, Walmart, and others have done a brilliant job in that. We've been doing that for a long time. We have not got the equivalent in B2B commerce because B2B transactions are much more complex. In the cloud, you can get all the parties together: the shippers, the insurance company, the manufacturers, and the purchasers. We can automate that entirely within the Oracle Cloud, one ERP system talking to another, talking to their bank, talking to their insurance, doing a loan origination, getting it shipped and insured. We make doing business much easier for our customers when they move to a modern cloud ERP system versus the on-premise ERP system that came before.\n\nRaymond Lenzchao\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Capital\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior VP, and Senior Research Analyst of Global Software, Bernstein\n\nThank you so much for taking my question. The top of mind questions I'm getting are related to AI in general, as you'd expect. More specifically, as it relates to Oracle, what the impact of AI will be on OCI Gen 2. Two related parts to the question. The first is the profitability of AI supercomputers and whether some clients try to tell me it's low-calorie, empty-calorie revenue, or can you maintain margins as this business grows. The second part is about the Oracle ecosystem. Is it strong enough that as workloads transition from model training to inferencing and grounding, could AI compute create a revenue air pocket or is the system strong enough so you don't have that? Thank you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, you're constantly training these models. Keep in mind, you have to bring in new data if you're obviously in the healthcare field, in the legal field. New cases are being judged, new research is being published all the time. For your AI models to be relevant, they have to be up to date. It's not that you train and then do nothing but inferencing thereafter. Your training and your inferencing sit right next to each other. As long as we can do this stuff twice as fast as everybody else, that's, by the way, not just on the training side, that's also on the inferencing side, we're going to be half the cost or better. We think we're going to be very, very competitive across the board, whether it's training or in inferencing.\nWe're pretty confident that we've got a cost performance advantage. If you run twice as fast in the cloud, you cost half as much because you pay by the hour. The performance advantage is really an enormous cost advantage for us. We don't see that going away anytime soon, and it applies to inferencing as well as training. Now, as far as GPUs, are GPUs a low-margin business? Not for 100% automated cloud with very, very low costs. We think in some cases, our prices for GPU training, which are very profitable, by the way, for us, are often lower. Our prices are lower than the cost of other hyperscalers doing the training.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior VP, and Senior Research Analyst of Global Software, Bernstein\n\nThank you. That's very helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to drill in on Cerner, basically the one-year anniversary of that acquisition. Maybe from Larry, get an update on where we are with modernizing that solution and modernizing that product and basically whether Cerner has kind of lived up to your expectations thus far. Maybe for Safra, if we could dig into the expense synergy side of the equation. You guys have done a great job increasing margins on a year-on-year basis in this quarter. How much is left to go within Cerner and getting that margin profile to match the broader Oracle margin profile?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay. I'll talk about the progress on taking the existing Millennium Cerner software and moving it to new Millennium, basically rewriting that software piece at a time, by the way. It's not going to be a big rip and replace at all. There's a two-phase process with Cerner. The first thing is to get the lift and shift and get the existing system hardened, which we've done, moving the customers to the cloud, which we're in the process of moving everybody to the cloud. That will give them better performance, better security, and new features will then start showing up with the system. There's a two-phase shift to the cloud. We're well on our way. The next is replace feature after feature after feature of the older Cerner system with a new Cerner system, new Millennium, which we are not coding in Java like we usually do.\nThe new Cerner system is being generated. As you know, generative AI generates code. We have an application generator called APEX. We are not writing code for the new Cerner. We are generating that code in APEX, and it's going extremely well. Again, one of the great things about code generators is they don't make mistakes. Well, either they make the same mistake over and over again, or once you fix the mistake, you fix it everywhere. We're using a code generator to write the new features in Cerner, and it's coming along very, very nicely. Also, on the business side of things, again, we think the Cerner business is going to get stronger and stronger. Safra made the point. The old Cerner business, you'd sell license. You sell a big contract, and you get a big chunk of revenue in that quarter.\nOur new business model, as you know, is cloud. We get a big Cerner award, and we get that money now over time rather than all upfront. That is, if you will, a bit of a revenue headwind. The Cerner business is doing extraordinarily well.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOn the expense side, we still have a ways to go, but I think it will become more obvious to you next quarter, the changes we've made as they play out through the income statement more clearly. You'll have a better comparison Q2 to Q2, which will be a full non-deal quarter for you to look at. You know us. We're always looking to save as much as we can, and to spend as little while still really transforming Cerner into a modern system in its entirety.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nLet me just reinforce what Safra just said. We love to save money. One of the things we did with our data centers is we automated them. We saved labor costs, and we have better security and better reliability because we eliminated human error. With Cerner, the rewrite of Cerner, it's not armies of programmers that are going to be rewriting this. We are generating the new Millennium software using APEX. That's also going to save us a lot of human labor, generate higher quality code, higher quality user interfaces, and better security all at once.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our last question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. My question's for Safra, I think. Safra, if the organic constant currency cloud growth was in line with what you did last year and what you want to do for this year at 29%, while license, though it was a difficult comp, it was a bit weaker, at least than the street was expecting. We also realize that cloud revenue for the same amount of business booked will be a lot less than the equivalent license revenue in the quarter. Does this mean we're seeing a move with stronger momentum to the cloud this quarter than we have seen? I guess just to clarify, given your guidance for the second quarter, you said you're maintaining your longer-term stuff, but I just want to clarify. Are you maintaining your constant currency organic cloud guidance for the year?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYes. Okay. Let me start with yes. As I want to remind you, of course, 29% of bigger numbers is more, okay? Last year we were smaller, and this year we continue to plan on doing the 29%, maybe better. All of it is dependent on us getting our data centers filled up and built out as fast as possible. The level of demand we have is stunning. Stunning is the only word I can use. I don't want to get overly exuberant simply because we do have to continue to build out our systems, etc. Yes, a very strong momentum to the cloud. Again, with the focus we told you, we're bringing our customers to the cloud, and that's going to have us focusing on growing that and stronger momentum there.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nOkay. Great. Very clear. Yes and yes. Got it. Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, John. Thank you, Lisa. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nToday, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude today's."

Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, Q4 was another fantastic quarter and the end of a great year. Before I get to the numbers, I'd like to go over our journey to get here. Three years ago, I shared with you that our own business transformation had reached a crossover point as our fast-growing businesses had eclipsed the size of our declining businesses. As a result, this would inevitably drive revenue growth acceleration going forward. Now, I don't blame you for not believing me at the time; fiscal year 2020 growth was zero. Well, as you can see, this has played out with organic revenue growth accelerating significantly, and that's despite the closure of our nearly $500 million Russia business.\nSince fiscal year 2020, our strategic back office SaaS business has more than doubled in size, and consumption of our Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure service is now 7x larger. While competitors have seen their growth rates drop precipitously over the last year, our cloud infrastructure growth rate has essentially doubled from last year to 77% this quarter, with Gen 2 OCI growth even higher. We're far from done. In fact, I just told my team I think we're at about the middle of the beginning. Looking ahead, I see even more growth opportunities that should help power future growth acceleration in the future. We remain committed to the fiscal year 2026 targets that we shared with you last fall at our Financial Analyst Meeting, and our exploding AI demand leaves us significant upside.\nOur momentum has been driven by two fundamental differences from our competition: one, highly differentiated technology, and two, a much better customer experience. Firstly, our cloud applications are very popular with a growing base of customers, in part because we are the most modern, comprehensive, and innovative set of apps across back office, CX, and industry applications. We implemented AI machine learning capabilities years before anyone was talking about it, and it helps our customers run their businesses every day. To complete the picture, we can serve customers of any size around the world, from small businesses on NetSuite to global enterprise on Fusion in all industries. Having the best cloud application technology has helped us grow the business to $11 billion in SaaS revenue while expanding gross margins.\nOn the infrastructure side, we're seeing more and more media articles reporting on the unique capabilities of OCI and our database technologies. Larry will explain our unique differentiation in a moment, but the result is that customers are choosing to run on Oracle infrastructure for all their requirements, be they new services like AI training, or services we're known for, like database and Java. To complement the technology, we've changed our culture such that we are totally focused on our customer's success. That partnership spirit starts with engineering as we work hand in hand with companies as they try out our technology and continues all the way through their success with us. There's no question that this close partnership with our customers has led to our success. As part of that, we've also created an organization called Customer Success Services, or CSS.\nThis group ensures the customers get the most value from their Oracle purchases, from planning to activation to implementation to support, to anything else they need to succeed. We think this unique approach, which customers already tell us they love, ultimately drives overall customer satisfaction, and that results in higher renewal rates, expansion rates, and referencing. Now, I'll turn to Q4. As always, I'll discuss financials using constant currency growth rates and also provide a full picture. To provide a full picture, I'm going to share with you results including and some excluding Cerner, so that you have it all. Total cloud revenues, SaaS plus IaaS, was $4.4 billion, up 55%, with IS revenue of $1.4 billion, up 77%, and SaaS revenue of $3 billion, up 47%. Excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS, was up more than 33% at $3.8 billion.\nTotal cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.4 billion, up 25%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include product support, were $4.4 billion, up 37%. Application-specific revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 11%. SaaS cloud revenue, again excluding Cerner, was $2.4 billion, up 17%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.6 billion and grew 24%, including Fusion ERP, up 28%, and NetSuite ERP, up 24%. Together, our strategic back office businesses are now larger and have grown faster than our local competitor for four straight years. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $5 billion, up 15%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 77%.\nExcluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 89%, with an annualized revenue of $5.2 billion. Including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 112%, Cloud@Customer consumption revenue was up 60%, and autonomous database was up 47%. Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 6%, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 41%. As on-premise databases migrate to the cloud and Cloud@Customer, we expect these cloud database services will be a third leg of revenue growth and revenue growth acceleration alongside back office SaaS, and Gen 2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenues were $2.2 billion, down 14%, following the 25% growth we saw a year ago in Q4. All in, total revenues for the quarter, including Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, were $13.8 billion, up 18%.\nShifting to margins, the gross margin percentage for cloud services and license support was 78% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenues, with its mid 90% gross margins, represented about 62% of cloud services and license support revenue, and now it's down to 53%. This is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support, even as license support continues to grow. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 19% with Cerner, 10% excluding Cerner in Q4. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. While we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 44% as we continue to integrate Cerner. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 9.2%, and the non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 in US dollars, up 8% in USD, 10% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $1.19. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $50 billion, up 22%, and excluding Cerner revenue, total revenue grew 7%. Total application subscriptions grew 35% and 10%, excluding Cerner, compared to 8% last year, and total infrastructure grew 10%, compared with 5% growth last year.\nClearly, our revenue growth continued to accelerate again this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue was $35.3 billion, up 21%. Total cloud services by itself were up 50% to $15.9 billion, and excluding Cerner, total cloud services were up 29% to $13.6 billion. With revenue growth acceleration in both strategic back office cloud applications, which were up 27% for the year, and cloud infrastructure services, which were up 63% for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.12 in USD, up 4% in USD, and up 10% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 42%. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9 billion, up 9%.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was up 42% at $5.6 billion, while free cash flow was up 46% at $3.7 billion. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.2 billion, up 80% from last year, as we're now seeing cash flow benefits from our cloud transformation. With capital expenditures of $8.7 billion this year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up from $5 billion last year, and I expect that we will see very good results in our fiscal 2024 free cash flow. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance, is $67.9 billion, up 47% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings, as well as Cerner. I would also note that organic RPO was 15% in constant currency as a result of our customers burning through their commitments at a heightened rate.\nI expect that you'll see this number run up as customers reload and new customers sign up. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.9 billion in Q4 and $8.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Our investment strategy for adding capacity remains to build many, many identical cloud regions. Our starting point is smaller, which allows us to go where competitors cannot, and this continues to be an advantage for us. Given the demand we have and see in our pipeline, I've increased our CapEx projection, and I now expect that fiscal 2024 will be similar to this year's CapEx.\nI also expect our Gen 2 OCI business will have another excellent year of revenue growth as existing centers fill up and new centers come online. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud. We now have 42 public cloud regions around the world, with another 7 being built. Twelve of these public regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We have many, many Cloud@Customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions, and 9 more planned. Lastly, we have 9 national security regions live, with immense demand for more. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend.\nThis year, this fiscal year, we repurchased 17 million shares for a total of $1.3 billion. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.7 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now to guidance. As I've said before, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. Let me turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis like everything else. If currency exchange rates remain as they are now, currency should have a 0%-1% positive effect on total revenue and a 1% positive effect on EPS in Q1. However, actual currency impact may be different.\nTotal revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in constant currency, and are expected to grow from 8% to 10% in USD at today's exchange rate. Additional upside depends on how fast we can put out even more capacity to our customers. Total cloud revenue, again excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 28% to 30% in constant currency, and 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% and 12% and be between $1.11 and $1.15 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% and 13% and be between $1.12 and $1.16 in USD. My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19.5%. However, as you see nearly every quarter, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary.\nNow, before I finish, let me also give you some initial thoughts on fiscal year 2024. As I described, and Larry will elaborate in depth, we are seeing unprecedented demand for our cloud services, and especially our AI services. As a result, I expect cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, will continue growing at at least similar rates to what we experienced in fiscal 2023, even though our base is much bigger, and maybe higher. As our high-growth cloud revenues are becoming a larger, larger portion of total revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of our total revenue growth. I expect this trend will continue in fiscal 2024, and, of course, we also expect to deliver a higher non-GAAP operating margin percentage this coming year as well. Okay.\nBefore I hand off to Larry, I want to take a moment to thank our customers for making fiscal year 2023 such an enormous success. You've been wonderful partners, and we thank you for your trust in us. I want to thank our employees for being focused on advancing our customers' mission so spectacularly. Some of you are new, and many of you have been with us for years, in fact, even decades, and I think you all see that our best days are, in fact, ahead of us. Thank you for your loyalty, and for your incredibly hard work. Thank you, Larry, our CTO, our Chairman, and our Founder, for leading with brilliance, determination, and vision, and allowing us to all be part of this incredible journey, which is just getting started. Thanks, Larry. With that, I'll turn it over to you for your comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Chairman, and Founder, Oracle\n\nThank you, Safra. The hardware and software in Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud is fundamentally different than other hyperscalers' clouds. The CPUs and GPUs we rent to customers are interconnected using an ultra-high-performance RDMA network, plus a dedicated set of cloud control computers that manage security and data privacy. Oracle's unique set of hardware and software building blocks enables our Gen 2 Cloud to deliver much higher performance than any of our cloud competitors. In the cloud, since you pay by the minute, if you run twice as fast, and we do, you pay half as much. What is especially interesting in today's world is that all of Oracle's cloud data centers have a high-bandwidth, low-latency RDMA network that is perfectly optimized for building the large-scale GPU clusters that are used to train generative large language models. NVIDIA themselves are doing AI development in the Oracle Gen 2 Cloud.\nWe are partnering with NVIDIA to build the world's largest high-performance computer, an AI computer with 16,000 GPUs. The extreme high performance and related cost savings of running generative AI workloads in our Gen 2 Cloud has made Oracle the number one choice among cutting-edge AI development companies, including Mosaic ML, Adept AI, Cohere, Modal Labs, Character, HyperReal, SliceX, Vector Space Bio, Falkonry, Respeecher, Altair, InfoWorld, TwelveLabs, Latent Space, plus many, many others. In the aggregate, our generative AI cloud customers have recently signed contracts to purchase more than $2 billion of capacity in Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud. One last thing. In partnership with Cohere, Oracle is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers. This new service protects the privacy of our enterprise customers' training data, enabling those customers to safely use their own private data to train their own private specialized large language models.\nOracle's application development teams were early adopters of this new AI cloud service. We used our own private data to improve and extend the training of existing Cohere large language models. This supplementary training resulted in two new specialized large language models, one for medical professionals, and one for first responders. Specialized large language models will be instrumental in helping highly trained professionals use their precious time more efficiently. As I said, Cohere and Oracle are working together to make it very, very easy for enterprise customers to train their own specialized large language models while protecting the privacy of their training data. Over the next few years, lots of companies are going to train their own specialized large language models. Our partner, Cohere, is also using the Oracle Gen 2 Cloud for training their own large language models.\nIn healthcare alone, specialized large language models will speed the discovery of new lifesaving drugs, improve the quality of patient care, and increase access to healthcare by lowering costs. A technology revolution is dawning. Back to you, Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nI think we're going to take some questions. Ken?\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of IR, Oracle\n\nYes. Thank you, Safra. Thank you, Larry. Lisa, if we could please prepare the audience for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question on the phone lines today, you can press star one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to remove yourself from the queue, it is star one again. We'll take our first question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. My question's for, I think, mainly for Safra, but maybe Larry has some thoughts too.\nIt's somewhat surprising to see the acceleration across all your cloud businesses when others, whether it's the other hyperscalers or even other cloud-based vendors, are seeing just the opposite effects in this environment, in today's environment. That's important. We get the better performance at a lower price. That makes a lot of sense. At least in, I've been around quite a while, I guess, and usually in tough environments, we see people just freeze. That's not what's happening here. The question, in addition to what I just said, better performance at lower price, why? Is there anything else outside of Oracle even that would show your cloud business accelerating when other pretty good companies are doing just the opposite?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nLet me take a start at it, and Larry, you add in here.\nFirst of all, the OCI acceleration, the fact that OCI is just growing and accelerating, is because customers want to spend less, and they also need to do more. They need to stay competitive, they need to stay agile. Our technology, whether it's our applications, which allow them to spend a lot less and make better decisions running their business, that's very, very natural. Our fusion, and there's just so many things about fusion that are so compelling. It costs less, it just helps them run their business. You go to OCI, where some of these customers are coming from our competitors. As Larry said, imagine Larry talked about the workload being twice as fast on OCI, but imagine it's 10x as fast or 100x faster, or, as is common in some cases, 1,000x faster.\nImagine what that bill looks like. We have compelling technology at a much lower price, and that's, without a doubt, causing our customers to move to us more quickly. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add into that.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Chairman, and Founder, Oracle\n\nWell, I'm just going to be a little more specific because Safra says, I said half, if we run twice as fast, we cost twice as much. No, we cost half as much. Half as much. We run twice as fast, we cost half as much. Sometimes we do run a lot more than twice as fast, and we cost a lot less than half as much. We announced a new database, a new version of MySQL with a fast query processor called HeatWave.\nWe have customers moving from Amazon Aurora, where they're experiencing a 1,000x speed up versus Aurora, where it's 1,000x faster in query processing than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's an open-source database that we added a fast query processor to. We're much, much cheaper. That's one example. In a lot of cases, it's much more than two to one. We can build GPUs that other people can't build because we have a fast network. We use this very fast RDMA network, and we started with that. In our Gen 2 Cloud, we had nothing but our entire network was a super fast network, which means most of the applications, most of the things you run in the Oracle Cloud are going to be much faster than our competitors' clouds because they don't use that kind of network.\nWe have huge cost advantages, huge cost advantages across a broad portfolio of applications. Let me throw in one thing. It costs one-tenth to implement Fusion ERP versus SAP's new ERP system with HANA. The cost of implementing our applications is dramatically lower than our competitors. We have a lot of people moving from AWS to our cloud for infrastructure services, a lot of people continuing to move from SAP to Fusion. We're seeing that migration, and we're taking a lot of market share from our competitors. That's why we're doing better, and they're not doing quite as well.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nWell, thank you. And really nice job. Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you so much, and congrats on a strong finish to the year.\nLarry, Oracle is somewhat unique in being a leader in both infrastructure and applications. When we look back, I don't know, maybe five years from now, how much of the generative AI opportunity will have been captured on the infrastructure side of your business versus within apps? I'm not just thinking strategic back-office apps. I'm thinking front-office, Cerner, and all the other verticals as well.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Chairman, and Founder, Oracle\n\nYeah, absolutely. It's very hard to answer that question. A long time ago, I said the biggest difference between, the biggest strategic difference between Oracle's cloud and everyone else's cloud is actually not the RDMA network. That's a technical difference. The biggest strategic difference is that we use our infrastructure and build applications with it. We learn a lot about how we can improve our infrastructure by building lots of applications, enterprise-scale applications on top of our infrastructure.\nWe have this continuous feedback loop where we're building applications, obtaining insights, making improvements in our productivity. We have a new programming language. We have Java, and we love Java. We use it a lot for building applications. We have this other low-code application development tool called APEX. We're now building a lot of our applications in APEX, and our productivity gains are, again, a factor of 10. We build the applications in one-tenth the time, or one-tenth the amount of people, or at one-tenth the cost. These are not typical low-code applications. These are applications that can scale to millions of users all over the world. Most low-code applications are for small projects. We use them for applications we've rolled out globally.\nWe've made our underlying infrastructure, the APEX development environment, the underlying APEX database, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database, has made our application developers dramatically more productive. It's one of the reasons why we bought into the idea that we could rewrite a whole suite of medical applications in a very, very short period of time, that we could redo Cerner very, very quickly because of these underlying tools. Let me close with one last thing. Again, we use AI technology to make our database better. It's an autonomous database. You don't need DBAs. It recovers itself. It updates itself. It adds more space. It really is a self-driving database. We've used AI technology to do that. We've used AI technology throughout our cloud, where our cloud is self-healing. We repair bugs while the cloud is running.\nWe have an autonomous Linux operating system that's different than all of the other Linuxes. You can patch it online. It patches itself online. It repairs itself online. By being in those two businesses, applications and underlying infrastructure, we, again, use our infrastructure and make it better to make our applications better. We gain insights as to what we need to do with our, what we need to add to our infrastructure to make the applications better. Infrastructures make the applications better. Applications make the infrastructure better. We're the only company with that continuous feedback loop. I think it gives us a huge competitive advantage in technology. It's why we have technologies that other people don't have.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nVery helpful, Color. Thank you, Larry.\n\nOperator\n\nTake our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThank you, and congrats on a great quarter.\nI want to dig into the application part of the business. Very impressive SaaS growth, especially in Fusion Apps and Cloud ERP in this macro environment. What are you hearing from your customer in terms of migrating to the SaaS application and what's driving that? Also, the cloud world last year, you talked about the opportunity in combining horizontal application with vertical offering. How is that helping SaaS growth?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nOkay. Well, I will tell you that there's no question. Our secret weapon is the fact that we have vertical applications also. Many of our customers end up wanting to buy a vertical application and Fusion together. It's industry by industry. We will be posting online probably some of our wins for the quarter.\nWhat you'll see is when we have existing customers in a segment and a vertical application in that, we truly are, without a doubt, the most popular, whether it's healthcare with all of our existing customers, whether they'd be Cerner customers. The fact that we have ERP and the ERP and HCM, SCM, all of our horizontal applications, CX, as well as the vertical applications, makes us very tough to beat. New healthcare wins are going to be listed. Many, many, many go live. It's the same in financial services, retail, hospitality. These whole segments end up wanting to buy their entire solution from us. That really makes us also very sensitive to their needs, and we can fill them much better. That's been a big winner for us.\nI will tell you that our customers also, when they move from on-premise, they realize that they're moving into the 21st century with a much better system, but also a much lower-cost system that also is kept current every 90 days. New capabilities become available. They'll never have to do that big implementation every five years like some of the older companies who say they're cloud but aren't actually cloud. They're just hosted. Our products are just so differentiated all around that we're just building momentum around the world. Go ahead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Chairman, and Founder, Oracle\n\nLet me just add one example to Safra's comments, which I think are right on. There's an interesting example. Everyone knows we compete with Workday in HCM or HR, whatever.\nWhen we bought Cerner, we decided that we were going to take our HCM system, our HR system, and specialize it, add features specifically for the healthcare industry. It turns out managing a workforce in a hospital is very complex because the nurses might have private patients at home that they're seeing. They might work for two or three different hospitals, and they might do some work in clinics as well. Scheduling these people who have multiple jobs, doctors may have teaching assignments in universities. Obviously, they travel, and they also have their own office hours. They have a private practice in addition to working at the hospital. Scheduling these professionals is very, very tricky. Recruiting the professionals is very, very tricky. Paying them when you're working three days a week one week, two days the next week, six days the following week, paying them can be very complex.\nWe have had a major effort in our HCM system, the Oracle Fusion HCM system, in adding all the features that hospitals need to manage their professional staff. There's no way we would have done that unless we had a focus in the healthcare industry. We not only have all the Cerner healthcare apps for hospitals, we've specialized our ERP system for hospitals, and we've specialized our HCM for managing the hospital workforce. We've done a bunch of things around the healthcare industry. One of the things we want to do is we're the largest provider of clinical trial software. The results of the clinical trial go to a government regulator.\nWe're now working with the government regulators to develop the software that allows them to take the clinical trial output in digital form and get it through the regulatory process much faster at a much lower cost. We're looking at the entire healthcare ecosystem and trying to automate both sides of the transaction. The pharmaceutical company that's designing the drug, the hospitals that are testing the drug, and the regulators that are approving the drug should all be digitized. We are well on our way to doing that because of our investment in Cerner, and now it's blossomed into an investment across the entire healthcare ecosystem.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThat's a perfect example, Larry. Thank you both for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHey, thank you. Could I switch gears a little bit? A question for Safra.\nSafra, we now have Cerner as part of Oracle. Where are we on the cost, on the synergy capture, and cost takeout? Do you see we are done there, or are we kind of still at the beginning of a journey? Thank you, and congrats from me as well.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThank you. I actually feel like we're still at the beginning, if you want to know the truth. We wanted to stabilize the operation. We definitely didn't want to risk breaking anything. You will be seeing some more significant changes. We have legal entity combination imminently, and that actually gives us a lot more flexibility regarding the way we operate the business. We are just at the very beginning of it. Their margins are nowhere close to the way we run our company.\nWe are right at the, I'd say we're at the beginning-ish, sort of at the beginning of the middle at most. We've got a long way to go just operationally. We've got a lot of work going on on the development side as we bring our technical capabilities into the product and move them into the Oracle Cloud. There are a lot of savings as we do that also.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter, and, frankly, on the guidance. I'd like to get a better understanding about the underpinning of the OCI Gen 2 business.\nSpecifically, can you give us some color on the customer concentration, industry concentration, both in the existing customer base as well as the pipeline, and how you think that's going to change over time? Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nI don't know, Larry. If you want to take a stab at it, the reality is that our customers run from very small to very large. As a general matter, we're a small percentage of their IT costs when they get started, and sometimes a small percentage of their cloud spending. As they try us out, they move larger percentages of their business off of other clouds or from on-premise. We're at the very beginning of this movement, especially on the database side, as more and more of our customers, our big customers, often have cloud customer or dedicated regions as sort of their ultimate goal for their most critical database workloads.\nWe're at the absolute beginning of that with most of our customers. Basically, what we find is if you give us a chance, it is so much better, so much more cost-effective, of course, so much more secure that customers very quickly realize how advantageous it is to move. It's all industries. As some of you know, auto companies are doing their simulations with us. It's across industries, across sizes. It's very, very diversified. Larry, I don't know if you have additional comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Chairman, and Founder, Oracle\n\nYeah. Maybe the most interesting industry that's adopting the Oracle Cloud are people who are in the technology business. A lot of our customers are, I mean, their business, I mean, Zoom in the early days of Oracle. It wasn't long ago we were talking about Zoom, and still very excited about Zoom.\nThey came to us, one of our earliest, very, very large customers. A lot of their business is just running an app, if you will, an application on the cloud. A huge amount of their expense is running that application in the cloud and doing it efficiently. Where we're most obvious, I mean, NVIDIA is an extraordinary company, but Cohere is a great company. A lot of their expense is running the AI training in the cloud. When it's that much of your expense, if we're a lot faster, they do a lot of due diligence about the technology. It became very apparent. A lot of the early adopters, if you will, and we're still in the early stages.\nA lot of the early adopters at scale of the Oracle Cloud were highly technical companies like Zoom or NVIDIA, and I can name a bunch of others, or a highly technical industry like phone companies, telecommunication companies, where they see the advantages, not only, by the way, the performance and cost advantages. Another thing that we're very proud of is because of our network, we're highly reliable, and because of the autonomy, we're highly reliable. If, for example, the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't lose your data because you can't make a pilot, usually a lot of the data loss is caused by pilot error. Well, with the Oracle Autonomous Database, there are no drivers. The driver is the system. It's a self-driving database, so you can't make a human error that causes you to lose data.\nIt's very where a phone company has to be up 24 hours a day, where a bank really is not supposed to lose your data, where a huge percentage of your expenses are your own cloud expenses, and you're a technology company delivering technology services from somebody else's cloud. In those areas is where we've seen adoption of Oracle at scale. The less technical companies are now beginning their journey of looking more closely at the Oracle Cloud. When they do look closely, we compare very favorably with the other cloud.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThat's very helpful. I really appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the last question from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director of Software Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks very much. Just a quick one for Safra, if I could. Safra, obviously, a very strong free cash flow quarter.\nWe've gotten some questions from investors wondering about the CapEx this quarter, where you saw some efficiencies, how you're able to keep CapEx flat going into next year, given the fact that you're going to see this great demand for OCI. Could you double-click on that a little bit for us? Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nYeah. I mean, this past year was a big CapEx number as compared to usual. We put out a lot of capacity. It is getting filled up and getting used up. I think we're getting real economies. In addition, one of the things you don't realize is that our underlying infrastructure for, for example, I'll give you one example. Our underlying infrastructure becomes more and more efficient. Even under the best example, actually, is under Fusion. As we've moved to OCI, we are also moving to autonomous database serverless, which, again, gives us added capacity.\nWe're constantly, constantly becoming more efficient. Our original landing was 12 racks. We're moving to 10 racks to have all the services. We're just continuing to sort of miniaturize our capabilities, and it's giving us enormous efficiencies and cost savings. Staying the same as this year, again, if it just becomes overwhelming, it may go up higher. I think we've got it very much in hand. We've laid out a lot this past year, and I think if we stay where we're at, we're going to be able to fit a lot more workloads within that envelope, straightforwardly.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director of Software Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of IR, Oracle\n\nThank you, Safra. Thank you, Kirk. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us on the call today.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of IR, Oracle\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your."

Q3 represented another great quarter with continued momentum on the top and bottom line. Before I get to the numbers, I want to share with you a few thoughts that explain what's behind our continued financial success. First, our cloud offerings drive operational efficiency. In fact, one of our competitors recently coined the term the Oracle Playbook, which I absolutely love because the Oracle Playbook is all about doing more while spending less.\nAs you all know, we started this ourselves over 20 years ago and have kept it up over all these years, resulting in the highest margins in the software business for decades. Using our own products and services enables us to increase our investments for growth while also growing profitability, including through acquisitions as well as during our move to the cloud.\nWe are constantly talking with our customers about leveraging Oracle technology to accelerate their speed to market and reduce costs, all the while improving the experience they deliver to their customers. The combination of Oracle's infrastructure and apps, which is unique in the cloud market, increases the intensity of business transformation. Cloud is no longer about just renting commodity white boxes. It's about velocity and value.\nWe have become the enterprise technology vendor of choice because we have products and services that help our customers drive cost efficiencies and modernize their businesses. Second, while AI has been dominating the recent news cycle, the truth is that our fusion and infrastructure customers have been using AI as an integral part of their business for some time. Oracle Fusion with embedded AI enables customers to close their books in days, not weeks. Oracle AI provides more relevant sales leads.\nOracle AI increases infrastructure performance and security with no human intervention. Customers using OCI get AI as a service to help drive their own business transformation. Given our scale and our information advantage across industries and technologies, we are constantly training our applications to do more for our customers, whether it's further automating processes, providing critical and timely recommendations, offering insight, or flagging potential issues.\nThat's real enterprise AI. It's what customers are looking for. It's designed into everything we do, and that's what our customers get when they use our platform. On our Gen 2 OCI platform, the architecture and unique network capability has fast become the platform of choice for many AI companies because OCI runs workloads faster, and time is money in the cloud. Coming to us saves our customers money.\nThird, customers are putting Oracle's comprehensive set of technologies to work in new and powerful ways to accelerate their businesses. The Uber win was notable because we have yet another example of an industry-transforming company concluding that Oracle's cloud performance and security exceeds that of our competitors, and at a price point that represents a sustainable, long-term partnership.\nUber will use more of our technology to drive value in their own business, and you're going to see a rising list of these types of strategic wins pile up in the quarters to come. Finally, before I move to the numbers, and hopefully no one missed this fact, we're announcing our earnings nine days after the close of the quarter, and we expect to file the Q right away. We continue to set the standard in operating efficiency, which helps customers see what's possible when they're working with us.\nOkay, now to the Q3 results. As always, I'll discuss them using constant currency growth rates to provide a full picture, both organically and otherwise. I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some revenue results excluding Cerner. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, including Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 48% in constant currency, with IaaS revenue of $1.2 billion, up 57%, and SaaS revenue of $2.9 billion, up 44%.\nNow, excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 28% in constant currency at $3.5 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.9 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.2 billion, up 33% in constant currency.\nInfrastructure subscription revenues, also including support, were $4.8 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support, but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again excluding Cerner, was $2.3 billion, and was up 16%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.2 billion, and grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up again 28%, and NetSuite ERP, up 26% this quarter.\nAs mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 57% in constant currency. When you exclude our legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 65% with an annualized revenue of $4.4 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 86%, cloud customer consumption revenue, up 73%, and Autonomous Database, up 50%.\nDatabase subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 3% in constant currency, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 40%. Database subscription revenue is largely made up of on-premise database support, but as these databases migrate from on-premise to the cloud and cloud to customer, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside back office SaaS and Gen 2 OCI cloud services.\nSoftware license revenue, including Cerner, were $1.3 billion, up 4% in constant currency. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.4 billion, up 21% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner's contribution of $1 billion and a half, organic revenue was up 7% in constant currency. As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing organic revenue growth to be negatively affected by 1% of growth over last year.\nShifting to margins, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue, with its mid-90s gross margins, represented about 63% of cloud services and license support revenue. Now, because our cloud services are growing so fast, it's down to 55%. Additionally, I would note that IaaS growth margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS growth margins will continue to improve.\nWhile we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner, and 6% excluding Cerner. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.2 billion, up 11% from last year. The operating margin, including Cerner, was 42% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter.\nAs we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. For example, while we have only owned Cerner for three quarters, we have already improved its operating margin by over 5 percentage points compared to before the acquisition.\nBy the way, I actually expect this year, FY 2023, the one we are closing out in one more quarter, will be the trough year for operating margins and percentages as our margin improvement initiatives play out. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%, and the non-GAAP EPS was $1.22 in US dollars, up 8% in USD, up 13% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.68 in US dollars.\nAt quarter end, we had nearly $8.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.6 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.5 billion, and free cash flow was $7.3 billion, with capital expenditures of $8.2 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 11% at $4.3 billion.\nThe remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance, is $62.3 billion, up 66% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner, which Larry will discuss in a moment. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate was 26% in constant currency. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx this quarter was $2.6 billion as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs.\nGiven the demand you see reflected in the RPO, as well as what we see in our pipeline, I expect that our CapEx investment will be about where it is right now for the foreseeable future. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately, and in line with booking trends. We now have 41 public cloud regions around the world, with another eight being built. In addition, 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities.\nWe have many cloud customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions, and another nine national security regions, with increasing demand for more. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for a total of $150 million.\nIn addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter, and the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% from $0.32 to 0.40 per share. Our financial strategy remains focused on growing non-GAAP operating and pre-tax income, while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. Given increasing customer interest in our cloud technologies, we will continue to prudently invest to meet this demand.\nAs a reminder, because now we're going to talk about Q4, last Q4, we had a spectacular double-digit revenue growth rate, highlighted by 25% constant currency growth in software license. With our continued migration to the cloud, we expect that we will continue to win big deals that are more subscription-driven than license-driven. These big subscription wins add to the backlog and are recognized over time rather than upfront.\nThat is exactly what we want to see as our cloud business continues to see excellent growth. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now, assuming that currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency would have a 2% negative effect on total revenue and at least 3%+ negative effect on EPS in Q4. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be very different by quarter end.\nHere we go. Total revenues for Q4, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 17% to 19 in constant currency and thus are expected to grow 15% to 17 in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53 in constant currency, 49% to 51 in USD.\nI expect total cloud growth for Q4, excluding Cerner, will be above 30% in constant currency. I expect growth in operating profit to be double digits. As you all know, my non-GAAP tax rate guidance is typically 20.5%. However, our tax rates over the last two years and Q4 have averaged around 11%, and I anticipate that in Q4 the most likely outcome is a non-GAAP tax rate of around 14.5%.\nWe've used this rate in determining our EPS guidance for Q4. Now, mind you, that's comparing it to 11% or 10.5%, I think, last year. Regardless, like past quarters, the actual tax rate for Q4 could be higher or lower and affect our actual EPS. With that, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% and 5% and be between $1.59 and $1.63 in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 1% and 3% and be between $1.56 and $1.60 in USD. What have I got here? Anyway, as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including Q4. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Safra. Since June of last year, when we acquired Cerner, that business has increased its healthcare contract base by approximately $5 billion. We have signed a diverse set of new and expanding domestic and international customers, including the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Veterans Affairs, hospital groups in a dozen US states, multiple hospitals in the United Kingdom, multiple provinces in Canada, the Australian Defence Forces, multiple hospitals in Puerto Rico, and multiple countries in the Middle East.\nWhile we are pleased with this early success of the Cerner business, we expect the signing of new healthcare contracts to accelerate over the next few quarters. Well, the Cerner business has been booking billions of dollars in Millennium clinical and electronic health record systems for hundreds of hospitals and ambulatory clinics. The overall Oracle healthcare application portfolio is actually much broader, covering virtually the entire healthcare ecosystem.\nHospitals are also buying the Oracle Fusion ERP system to manage their revenue cycle, and from reimbursements from insurance companies to patient billing, plus their medical supply chain from ordering to inventory. Hospitals are buying Fusion HCM to manage their complex, high-value workforce of doctors, nurses, and technicians. Pharmaceutical companies are buying Oracle Clinical One to manage clinical trials. Government health organizations, public health organizations, are using aggregated EHR data to monitor infectious disease and respond to outbreaks quickly and efficiently.\nNow, I'd like to take a couple of minutes and go over a little more specifically some of the Cerner wins since we bought the company. One huge win at Labcorp and Ascension Health to deploy a single lab information system domain for 96 separate hospital-based labs across 10 states. Another one in Puerto Rico, Auxilio Mutuo, is an all-new electronic health record footprint to deploy in a 600+ bed academic private hospital, replacing Altera Paragon with Cerner Millennium.\nVandalia Health, formerly Charleston Area Medical Center, consolidated all their EMRs into a single unified domain and added four new hospitals. UHS modernized their revenue cycle, migrated to CareAware, the CareAware cloud, for their hospitals and ambulatory clinics. Banner Health implemented a complete revenue cycle management for their health business. The VA deployed our unified electronic health record system to 19 additional sites.\nThe Department of Defense deployed Oracle Cerner EHR to all the OCONUS locations in the Department of Defense, the US Department of Defense. In the UK, at the National Health Service, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals deployed the full suite of Cerner applications across three additional sites in the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. The Princess Alexandra Hospital, also in the NHS, is a 430-bed hospital that added the full Cerner suite.\nMubadala Health was the first Cerner Millennium client to move from the Cerner data center directly now to the OCI Cloud. As we move our Cerner patients from the Cerner data centers into the Oracle OCI Cloud, we would expect to get much better security, much better reliability, much better performance, and dramatically lower our cost of providing that cloud service. OCI is just much more efficient than the Cerner data centers that we acquired.\nWe've deployed the full EHR footprint, Cerner footprint, to four Sheikh Khalifa Hospitals in the UAE with a capacity of 1,200 beds, serving a population of 1.4 million citizens, again, in the UAE. The Australian Department of Defence, we delivered acute care capabilities and deployed an environment for all of the Australian Defence hospitals and field hospitals.\nIn Canada, starting in Nova Scotia, we deployed a one-patient, one-record EHR system across the province for the citizens of Nova Scotia. One-patient, one-record. As you know, I've discussed a long time the fact that patient electronic health records are scattered across every provider they visit. That problem is now being solved in Nova Scotia by having a single unified patient record for every patient, regardless of which provider they visit. Their records are still all in one place.\nSame thing in Niagara Health, a new EHR footprint to support delivery of care for 450,000 citizens, again, in Canada. Okay, I'm going to stop with that. Those are direct Cerner wins since we acquired Cerner. On top of that, we have all of the, if you will, the rest of the healthcare suite, which is made up of Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM, Oracle Clinical One for clinical trials, Oracle ERP for managing everything from procurement and inventory, the entire supply chain, Oracle HCM for managing the enormously complicated scheduling and paying of their professional workforce of doctors, nurses, technicians, etc.\nWe're very strong in this part of the business. Our customers include the Cleveland Clinic, who use our ERP system in their hospitals and our supply chain systems. The Mayo Clinic, also ERP, supply chain, and HCM to manage the workforce.\nMount Sinai Hospital, ERP, SCM, and HCM. Providence St. Joseph Health, ERP, SCM, HCM, and actually CX customer engagement. Adventist Health uses Oracle ERP, SCM, HCM, and CX. Kaiser Permanente, a huge Oracle HCM user to manage their workforce. The NHS in the UK, ERP and SCM. United Healthcare, ERP and HCM. Blue Cross Blue Shield, ERP, HCM, HCM, and CX. Humana, ERP and SCM.\nHighmark Health, ERP, SCM, all Fusion products or HCM. Healthcare Service Corporation, again, you see a pattern here, ERP, HCM, and CX. Independence Blue Cross, ERP and HCM. Bright Healthcare, ERP. Now, in this past quarter, we had major wins at Ascension Health, buying ERP, HCM, SCM, and HCM, where the primary competitor in HCM was Workday.\nAs we add specific features to manage the healthcare workforce to our HCM product, Oracle becomes more and more successful in selling our HCM products within the healthcare ecosystem. Our win rates are going up dramatically, and our sales cycles are going down. University of Texas Health in San Antonio was a big HCM win there.\nLabcorp bought ERP and HCM, where the competitor in ERP was SAP. We won Blue Rock Therapeutics, where they bought ERP, SCM, and Fusion Analytic Warehouse. Again, the competitor there was SAP. This, by the way, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer AG, so it was nice to win in a German-owned company against SAP. ICU Medical expanded their HCM for vascular therapy and oncology. Dexcom ERP, EPM, SCM. Cytel ERP, EPM, SCM, a win over SAP. We had some huge go-lives in the quarter.\nProvidence Health, a huge SCM customer, rolled out to 12 additional ministries. The National Health Service in the UK have all the trust hospitals are all now live with ERP. Baptist Healthcare have now 10,000 employees live on HCM. Texas Children's Hospital, 21,000 employees live on HCM. Kelsey-Seybold Clinics are now completely live in HCM. I can go on and on, but rather than doing that, I'm just going to turn it back over to Safra.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Larry. Emma, if you could please poll the audience for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your first question today comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much, and congratulations on the really good quarter. With the slowdown we're seeing across so many IaaS, PaaS vendors over the last couple of quarters, and especially this quarter, why has OCI Gen 2 held up so well? You have born-in-the-cloud customers, which is seeing weakness elsewhere. You have enterprises. Is it simply low price? Is it performance? Is it you're at the right time in the economic cycle to be capturing new customers? Is there some dynamics around expiry credits that are driving this? The difference is too stark. I think it's really important. The more color you can give, the better. Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nAll right. I'd like to take a crack at that. I'll start by checking with Jensen over at NVIDIA. He and I had a very interesting conversation. Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud is quite different than the other hyperscalers. We have an RDMA network, a non-blocking RDMA network.\nOur network is much faster than the other guy's network. What this means is, if you're running a large group of NVIDIA GPUs in a cluster doing a large AI problem at Oracle, we can build these AI clusters, these NVIDIA GPU clusters, and run them. We can build those things dynamically because our standard network supports the large clustering of GPUs and allows them to communicate very quickly.\nWe can create these groups of GPUs, and we can marshal them together. The other guys can't do that. They can build clusters, but they actually literally are physically building a new cluster. They're building new hardware. Our existing hardware, our standard network, allows us to group these things together dynamically, these GPUs together dynamically, to attack AI problems. No one else can do that.\nWe have a lot of business, a lot of new AI companies coming to Oracle because we're the only ones that can run their workloads. By the way, we are cheaper. We're faster, and we're cheaper. Let me give you an example where we use it ourselves. We have a partnership in healthcare, back to this healthcare thing.\nWe have a partnership in healthcare with MD Anderson Hospital and one of our independent software vendors called Ronin, where we build these disease-specific AI modules that make recommendations to doctors about care. What they really say at MD Anderson, if we see a patient with these symptoms, this is how we respond. That's a big AI model that's built by MD Anderson, working with Ronin, running in the Oracle Cloud.\nWe've actually shown, or I should say MD Anderson has actually shown, if you use this system, you reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by 30%. That's a stunning number. People talk about ChatGPT being really cool because it can write my high school essay for me. Well, how about reducing hospital readmissions at MD Anderson by 30%? You decide which is more important. AI is fabulous stuff. Yeah. ChatGPT is very cool.\nThere are other applications other than generative language in these large language models. We've really focused on healthcare in the last year or so since the acquisition of Cerner, and are working diligently with others to apply AI to healthcare, and especially the management of complex diseases like cancer. This is a cancer AI system. We're also doing wellness, heart disease, etc., down the road.\nWe think our platform runs AI very, very well because we create these clusters of GPUs that can attack big problems very quickly. We do it economically. We build the applications on top of that. We provide the service to a lot of the startups in the AI world. This is one example of where we're just way ahead of the other hyperscalers in terms of our network, and our ability to do AI. Let me point out one last AI thing. The Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't have any database administrators. It's completely self-driving. The Oracle Autonomous Database is self-driving because it is driven by, it is an AI module that is the DBA. We've replaced the DBAs with AI inside of our own cloud.\nThe Oracle Autonomous Database actually runs all the databases inside of the administrative part of our cloud, keeps track of all of our users, our billing, all of those things, recovery datasets. All of that stuff is now done using AI and our autonomous database. We're a huge consumer of AI. We're a huge vendor of AI GPU capacity, clustered capacity. We build AI modules in healthcare. People are coming to us. NVIDIA is often recommending us as the best cloud for AI. This is a good time to be there.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JP Morgan\n\nThank you, Larry. My question was very much related to that, but maybe from a slightly different angle.\nI'm wondering if you could drill into the opportunity that you do see on the generative AI side. We're repeatedly hearing that companies are running those kinds of models on OCI. NVIDIA is moving some of those workloads to the Oracle Cloud. The other concept being that these AI models are so data-hungry and that you have all the data already contained in the Fusion applications. I am curious if that piece of it, the generative AI piece, is something that you see lining up as a growth driver that is material overall on the entire business.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOh, the answer is absolutely yes. There's actually more demand for AI processing than there is available capacity. We're the only ones, again, that can dynamically, and by the way, we're short. We are expanding as fast as we can. It's really interesting.\nIt's an exciting opportunity, but it's challenging when there's more demand than supply. The difference with us is our standard network allows us to group together these GPUs and have them attack these problems, whether it's a medical diagnostic problem or it's a generative language problem like a ChatGPT.\nWe have a lot of ISVs seeking us out because not only do we have the most cost-effective solution, we can make the solution available to them very quickly because it runs on our standard network. We can create a cluster for them, they run their workload, and the moment their workload is through running, we can reallocate that cluster or break that cluster up and allocate it to other users. The other guys can't do that.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JP Morgan\n\nThank you. They can't do it dynamically.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you. Next question, please, Emma.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I'll echo my congratulations, especially on sustaining a very high OCI growth. Larry, one area we've been doing more work on is how cloud vendors can help transform the telco market, including migrating their IT infrastructure and their network operations to the public cloud, which should lead to greater efficiencies, and also give them a more effective platform to roll out new 5G and edge application services. I know you guys touched on this a bit at last year's Analyst Day, but I was just hoping to get an update on how you're thinking about that telco opportunity with the Oracle stack, especially with OCI.\nWho are some of the telco operators you're partnering with and how you see this playing out over the next couple of years?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. This is an exciting business for us. I mean, we're actually creating dedicated data centers for Vodafone. I'm not sure how many we've already built as yet, but if you will, Vodafone is moving a substantial part of their business into the Oracle Cloud. We have this ability to build data centers for customers. Those data centers are OCI data centers that we run for them, but they are dedicated to workloads at a particular customer. Nomura, the first of them we built a few years ago in Japan for Nomura. They have a primary, and now they have a backup. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange on that, and they sell it into financial services in Japan.\nThat's an OCI data center that we built for Nomura where they're reselling the capabilities. Vodafone's, again, another example of someone we're building dedicated data. These are OCI data centers that we run. They're in our constellation of data centers. They look like all the other OCI data centers, they're automated like all the other OCI data centers, so we take advantage of those economies of scale, and that skilled labor that runs them.\nAgain, a lot of it is AI, but a lot of it, we still have human beings. We've done that for Vodafone. Same thing, Dish Networks' entry into telephony is enabled by similar architectural approach using OCI. I can go on and on, but it's one of our industries of emphasis. I think you'll see us, and that's going to be a huge area of growth for us.\nAs telcos, we've always been very strong in telcos. Now they're beginning to move to the cloud, and we're seeing some major commitments from some of our largest customers around the world. We're also seeing financial services companies take a slightly different point of view, where they want to keep things, if you will, quote on-premise. Since we can build an OCI region and dedicate it to a bank, we're doing more, if you will, call it clouded customer, where we build a dedicated region for a financial service.\nNomura was an example. Nomura in Japan, but there are other examples. We build these clouds for banks. I mean, huge industries moving to the cloud in a slightly different way than other industries, not moving to public cloud, but rather preferring to have these dedicated regions. It's just their applications in this cloud.\nWe have the ability to do that. Again, Amazon does not, Microsoft does not, and Google does not.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. I think this question's for Safra. We've heard a lot about your committed cloud mega deals, but you sometimes have talked about pure consumption or pay-as-you-go deals. Other vendors that employ the pay-as-you-go model, such as Mongo and even Snowflake to some extent, who had been getting a ton of traction in the market, have either seen or they anticipate dramatic slowdowns. We haven't seen anything like that in your results at all, and certainly not in your guidance. Can you talk about your exposure to such deals and how they're progressing?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nAs Larry was touching on it, we have many, many enterprise customers, phone companies, banks, governments who make commitments to us as part of their move to cloud. We do have some pay-as-you-go customers, but the bulk of our revenue, first of all, our SaaS revenue, as you know, you implement an accounting system. You're not going to pay less tomorrow. You still have to run your accounting system.\nThe SaaS side of the business, again, is fully committed. Because we have so many important enterprise customers who are bringing basically their crown jewels into our cloud and had been waiting really for us to be in the position to receive those, they want to have a two-way commitment. They want to know that we have the capacity for them, and they want to get a slightly better price.\nFirst of all, those that go into the public cloud, whether it's Telecom Italia, Verizon, or some of these others, obviously would like a better price. They make commitments to come in, usually committing less than they expect to use and almost always using more than they expected. However, other customers have clouded customers, as Larry mentioned, or other different arrangements, the alloy arrangement where we have a combination with a telco or a data center provider.\nThose are all committed. We are very strong in the commitments from our customers. By the way, they want to make sure we have available capacity back for them because many of them get rid of their data centers when they're finished. That's the ultimate goal for them. They don't want to be running back and forth. These aren't toy workloads. These are critical workloads for their business, and they want to know that they've got a place to put those.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThe commitment is a lot of these, it sounds like these people are committed to ramping up to the full capacity of their data center. Not until they do that do they shut down, for the most part, the data center they're replacing. Okay. Awesome. Okay.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nJust so that we're clear here, pay-as-you-go at Oracle is less than 5% of our business. Okay? Is that clear?\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Senior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThat's very clear. Thank you very much, Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question today comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nExcellent. Thank you so much for taking my question.\nLarry, as I think about the strong momentum in Cerner, expanding the contract base by $5 billion and your expectations for the business to accelerate, can you parse through the drivers in terms of new logo win rates versus the expansion and cross-sell you're doing with Fusion, for example? Also, Larry, you touched on the idea of a single medical record. People have been talking about this for decades. When does it become clear that Oracle's helping improve the quality of care and saving lives? I've got a quick follow-up for Safra, if Ken will allow.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and CTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, I think there are two things. One is the system we're putting in for the DoD and for the VA is one patient, one record. That's a model of it. The one we're going into Nova Scotia is the same.\nWe are bidding on a huge contract for the NHS. Some of these contracts are enormous, and the responsibility to go along with the contracts is also enormous. That's how our system works. Our standard system that we have built is one patient, one record in the database. If you visit Stanford, UCLA, Mayo Clinic, and Cleveland Clinic, even if you go to those four different providers for a variety of different issues, all of your data will be in one database.\nAll your patient data will be in one place, immediately accessible in a time of emergency or just a routine visit to the doctor. That's how our system is architected. That's how we're delivering it to customers. To customers right now, it's attracted a lot of attention.\nActually, it's not only much better for the patient, it helps doctors get better information, deliver better outcomes, but it's also less expensive to do it that way than every hospital maintaining their own system. Rather, it's better that they should share a system in the cloud and integrate their data for the benefit of the patient.\nSaving lives is exactly what is happening with our partner at Ronin and our partner at MD Anderson and other partnerships I could go into in more detail, and I'm happy to, but not on this call, is these disease-specific AI modules and the telemedicine modules that we're delivering allow a patient in a community hospital in Montana to get the benefits of the wisdom of the best cancer specialists at MD Anderson Hospital in Texas, or Memorial Sloan Kettering doc in New York, or a Mass General doctor who's on faculty at Harvard Medical School. The fact that we're now using AI and telemedicine and instrumenting these diagnostic devices.\nIn the community hospital, we have diagnostic devices that the Harvard faculty member at Mass General can look at, and then they inspect the AI module to, A, gather much better information, and with that better information, have the best minds and AI, real minds and artificial intelligence processing that information and prescribing, hopefully, the best procedure or the best medication for that particular patient, which translates into reducing readmission to the hospital as it did at MD Anderson and ultimately saving lives.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you so much for that, Larry. The mission is so important. If I could just sneak in a quick one for Safra to follow up. Safra, 30% organic cloud growth for the year implies significant acceleration in Q4. What supports your confidence in delivering that? Thank you so much.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, remember, as I told you, we have dropped a large number of data centers.\nAs they become available, we have customers waiting to get started and use them. We have commitments from customers to quite an enormous amount of consumption. They have basically been waiting for us. We have taken a while in all these different countries to open these data centers and to make them available to our customers. We know they are actually very impatient to use the capacity as it becomes available. We just have a lot of momentum, a lot of commitment from our customers, and a lot of enthusiasm around our offerings. That is how the math works.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Brad and Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Emma for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect."

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Oracle Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speaker's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond, Head of Investor Relations at Oracle. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, [Bill]. Good afternoon, everyone, and Welcome to Oracle's Second Q Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website as well. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, and CEO Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nExecutive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors, Oracle\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, simply put, we had an outstanding quarter. Total revenue for the Q, was more than $200 million above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 25% in constant currency. Even excluding Cerner, total revenue grew 9% in constant currency. That's higher than Q1, and on top of a revenue beat this time last year. The strength of the Q, is even more amazing, given that the currency headwind was higher than what it was when I gave guidance, with 6% for revenue, and a 9.5% headwind for Earnings Per Share. Yet, we still exceeded the high end of my USD guidance for both total revenue and Earnings Per Share. As you can see from the numbers, we continue to experience clear company-specific and product-specific momentum.\nThe reasons are many, but it boils down to a few key points of differentiation. First, more and more customers are recognizing our second-generation infrastructure cloud as being fundamentally better architected for higher performance, better security, and unmatched reliability versus the older first-generation hyperscale cloud providers. Second, customers appreciate the flexibility of our service and business model that enables them to deploy our technologies where it serves them best, whether that be in the public cloud, in dedicated regions around the world, or in a true cloud at customer implementation. Third, customers recognize the value of an end-to-end integrated stack of applications, both horizontal like ERP, HCM, and supply chain, and industry-specific applications that focus on their industries. All of it is on our Gen 2 Infrastructure, which is designed perfectly for them as they move through.\nAs customers increasingly look to better value out of their technology investments, many discover that Oracle is much better compared to other alternatives. Gartner formerly recognized OCI by moving us to visionary status in its cloud infrastructure and platform services report for the first time. In addition, last week, we were awarded a JWCC award at the US Department of Defense as they also recognized our capabilities. As all of these differentiators come together, and our business continues to accelerate, we expect organic growth for our fiscal year 2023 cloud revenues will be over 30% in constant currency. Now to the numbers. As always, I'll discuss our results using constant currency growth rate. To provide a full picture, both organically and otherwise, I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the revenue results excluding Cerner, so you can see what's going on.\nTotal cloud revenue, now that's SaaS and IaaS, including Cerner, was $3.8 billion, up 48% in constant currency, with IaaSF revenue $1.1 billion, up 59%, and SaaS revenue of $2.8 billion, up 45%. Excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS, was up 27% in constant currency at $3.3 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.6 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and, of course, our Generation 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.1 billion, up 35% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.3 billion, up 9% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again excluding Cerner, was $2.2 billion and was up 16%.\nNow, our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.9 billion and grew 26% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 28%, and NetSuite ERP, up 29%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 59% in constant currency. Excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 69%, with an annualized revenue of $3.8 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 88%, cloud at customer consumption revenue, up 83%, and autonomous database, up 50%. Software license revenues, including Cerner, were $1.4 billion, up 23% in constant currency, and up 9% without Cerner. What is increasingly resonating with customers is that in an environment where IT investments need to have a fast and tangible return on investment, only Oracle offers customers the flexibility to manage their technology estate so they can deploy incremental investments where it brings them the most immediate value.\nIt also helps that the purchase of technology licenses from Oracle enables them to move to the cloud as they are ready, effectively providing an on-ramp to Oracle Cloud Services. All in, total revenues for the Q, were $12.3 billion, up 25% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, organic revenue was up over 9% in constant currency. As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing total revenue growth to be negatively affected by over 1% of growth over last year. Shifting to margins, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue, with its mid-90s gross margins, represented about 65% of the total number of cloud services and license support revenue.\nNow, it's down to 53%, and this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support. By the way, license support grew 4% this year. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved again this quarter, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. In response to accelerating demand, we have continued to build data center capacity. We have seen that as those centers fill up, margins go up, like they did this quarter. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner, and 6% excluding Cerner in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin, including Cerner, was 41% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter.\nAs we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle levels and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. Further, I expect that this year will be the trough year for operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the Q, was 20.4%. I think I guided to 20.5%, so basically, it worked out where we thought. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.21 in US dollars, down 1% in USD, up 7% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.63. At Q end, we had nearly $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.7 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.1 billion, and Free Cash Flow was $8.4 billion, with capital expenditures of $6.7 billion.\nIn addition, we now have 40 public cloud regions around the world, with another nine being built. In addition, 12 of these public regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We also have many cloud at customer implementations, dedicated regions, and another nine national security regions, with increasing demand for more as customers want to have their data protected in their country. We are careful to pace our investments appropriately, but need to continue to build to meet our accelerating demand. CapEx this Q, was $2.4 billion as we continue to invest in our cloud to meet this accelerating demand. With triple-digit IaaS bookings growth the last couple of quarters, we now expect to spend about this amount per Q, for the next few quarters as we build capacity for our customers' needs. This level of spend, though, will not negatively impact our operating margins as we scale.\nWhen I talk about accelerating demand, that demand is reflected in the remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance, which is now at $61.2 billion, up 68% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as to Cerner. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate in constant currency accelerated to 28% in Q2, up from 22% last quarter. Approximately 48% of the total RPO is to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Now, as we've said before, I know you're tired of me saying it, but I will. We are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares for a total of $448 million.\nIn addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter, and the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth, and given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest, as there is strong demand for our cloud services. Now, let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Using currency exchange rates as they are right now, currency should have a 4% negative effect on total revenue and at least a 6%- effect on EPS in Q3. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by Q end, but we've got to use the number, so we're using the number right now.\nTotal revenues for Q3, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 21% to 23 in constant currency and are expected to grow from 17% to 19 in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50 in constant currency and 43% to 47 in USD. I expect the total cloud growth for the fiscal year, excluding Cerner, will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% and 13% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency. Again, due to currency headwinds, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $1.17 and $1.21 in USD. As I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q3. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20.5%, which is up from 19% last year.\nHowever, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given Q to vary. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nThank you, Safra. Okay, I'm going to go over primarily, I'm going to go over customers and new wins in infrastructure, and then customers and wins and go-lives in applications. I'm going to start with infrastructure. During Q2, we signed multiple customers to contracts exceeding a billion dollars, infrastructure contracts exceeding a billion dollars. Let me be clear. Multiple customers signed contracts for a billion dollars' worth of infrastructure. Given that's been added to our backlog, we expect our infrastructure business to continue to grow very, very strongly into the future. We now have 22,000 infrastructure customers. We have a total of 55 regions, that's public regions plus national security regions and the other kinds of regions.\nThat's more than AWS, Microsoft, or anybody, which may surprise some people. Gartner and Sacramento moved us into the visionary quadrant for the first time. Let me just start naming specific customers and give you a flavor. I'm going to name large customers, small customers. I'm going to focus a little bit on a bunch of international customers to let you know that our investment in data centers all over the world is really paying off. Our customers include big customers like FedEx, Deutsche Bank, and Tokyo Stock Exchange. Let me take a moment to emphasize Tokyo Stock Exchange. We're the only ones running a major stock exchange, and Tokyo is not the only one because our cloud is very secure and extremely reliable. It doesn't go down.\nIn fact, my favorite quote from the big phone company in the United States was, the difference between Oracle's cloud and the other clouds is simply that Oracle's cloud doesn't go down. I think that's a very important issue when you have enterprise applications like a stock exchange where you can't ever go down. Fujitsu is another big customer. Vodafone, a phone company, has similar problems. If you're a phone company, the phone system can't go down. Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Enbridge, Kaiser, a huge healthcare company primarily in the United States. NVIDIA has moved, and a bunch of others have moved lots of AI, artificial intelligence, and machine learning workloads to the Oracle Cloud because it turns out we're really good at that. We're better than that than any of the other clouds, which may surprise some people. Schneider Electric, Telecom Italia, Verizon, and lots, lots more.\nI'm not going to just list them all. We published a big list at oracle.com, and every quarter, we add new customers to that. In the quarter, we added United Airlines database wins in the quarter. United Airlines migrating all flight operations to the Oracle Exadata Cloud. Albertsons, again, moving to the Exadata Cloud Service database. Mitsui in Japan, again, moving their databases to Oracle. This is the beginning of a very major, very large business for us as our database franchise moves primarily from on-premise into the Oracle Cloud. PERSOL Career, a big professional services company in Japan, migrating to or moving their Oracle databases to the cloud. Unimed Curitiba, and LAD at healthcare, once again, moving their databases to the Oracle Cloud. Penske Truck Leasing, using -- moving to Autonomous Database. HomeServe, a PLC in the UK, government agency, is moving the Autonomous Transaction Processing system.\nThey're not just moving an existing Oracle database to the cloud. They're upgrading from our on-premise Oracle database to our autonomous database, which is only available in the cloud. Iberia Express, BIGTELCO, same thing, moving to autonomous data warehouse. The idea is the autonomous data warehouse makes database administration very simple. In fact, it's entirely automated. There is no database administration. [Delgado] Taxi, again, in APAC, a smaller company, again, moving their databases to our autonomous system. MaxiTrans, a big transportation company in Australia, same thing, autonomous transaction processing. The Scroll, a big Japanese wholesale company, autonomous, moving to autonomous database. Banco Safra, by the way, this is not our CEO does not own a bank.\nThis is not an internal, she did not buy our database, but there's a big bank in Latin America called Banco Safra, and they're moving all their mission-critical apps to OCI, as is Bradesco. Same thing. Yorkshire Building Society in the UK, again, autonomous data warehouse. Nestlé, a food giant in EMEA, is moving their analytic systems to autonomous data warehouse. That's a huge customer. I mentioned a couple of calls ago that we have a new version of our MySQL open-source database, and we added a new ultra-fast query processor called HeatWave to MySQL, and that's doing extremely well. We have a number of companies doing that migration: Medallia, [Intonel], Credit Club. It's a long list of people that are moving to MySQL to take advantage of the fact that our query processor in our version of MySQL is 100x faster. I really mean that.\nWe have all the benchmarks. We publish all the benchmarks, and we publish the source code of the benchmarks so you can duplicate those results 100x faster for queries than the Amazon equivalent called Aurora, Amazon's version of MySQL. As Safra mentioned earlier, our partnership with Microsoft Azure is going extremely well. We have a number of companies running applications in Azure, and then Azure is connected to OCI, so the database is in OCI, and the application is in Azure. Belgian Railways is one, Honeywell in the United States, PETRONAS, the big energy and utility company, Telecom, Italian MobileAI, but that multi-cloud system is doing extremely well. We think that is the future of cloud. We think the future of cloud is not four-walled gardens, AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle.\nWe think those clouds are all going to interconnect, and customers will pick the most appropriate service for their particular needs and mix and match between the clouds. A lot more. A major city in the Southwest, which I'm not allowed to mention, is literally migrating everything to OCI. Lambda, which is a big AI machine learning specialist company, is moving the bulk of their workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs and our very, very fast network to interconnect them. This is a pattern. Lambda is doing that. Latent Space is doing that. NVIDIA themselves are doing that. You're seeing a lot of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads moving from other clouds to OCI because we're faster. In the cloud business, faster when you charge by the minute. Faster means cheaper. Give me one second. Alexa, be quiet. Sorry about that.\nI think Jeff Bezos did that. Okay. Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, National Institutes of Health, these are all new cloud customers, new infrastructure cloud customers. Sierra Nevada Brewing, again, from very large to medium-sized companies, are moving to OCI, and lots of them. Twist Biosciences is moving healthcare, again, AI workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs. AIA Life Insurance Company, a big financial services company, again, is moving to OCI and databases to OCI. In India,Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation, a giant utility, is moving all of their metering and billing applications to OCI. [Wenwen] Intelligent Information Technology is moving their IoT platform from AWS to OCI, and they're also using MySQL HeatWave. Algar Telecom, Brazilian Stock Exchange, Claro, again, big media telco, moving to OCI. Entel, Unimed Curitiba, a large healthcare company in Latin America, , large healthcare company in Latin America, moving to OCI. Vivo, again, moving to OCI.\nBanco de Chile, eBanks, another financial services company, Rabobank, DP World, the transportation logistics company in the Middle East, Austin Transit Partnership, a municipality in Texas. They are an interesting customer because they've been using Oracle ERP and EPM in our applications for a long time. Now they're moving their infrastructure to OCI. Oman Telecommunications, a huge French telecommunications company I'm not allowed to mention, they're moving to OCI. Oxford Nanopore, a big gene sequencing company, is moving from AWS to OCI where they're going to store our gene sequencing. They don't just store gene sequences in OCI, they also do analytics to figure out if what they've sequenced is a new version of COVID-19 or another pathogen, a pathogen they've never seen before. Extremely important application for world health. Reed Exhibitions, Saudi Ministry of Media, EcoBank Financial Services in EMEA, GlobeMed Limited, Morrisons, a big retail operation.\nAgain, all moving to OCI. HDFC Bank and Laffey Bank. I'm going to stop there, but we published a long list, there's tremendous momentum, tremendous momentum, and a large number of customers from all over the world, very large and medium-sized companies moving to OCI. The business is growing very strongly, as Safra pointed out in the numbers. Okay. In the back, in applications, I'll try to do this quickly. We're just winning in the back office. We have 22,000 customers in infrastructure and in the cloud. We have 11,000 Fusion ERP and HCM customers alone in applications. Just Fusion customers, we have 11,000 now. We have probably close to 30,000 NetSuite customers on top of that. We have a lot of customers in applications. We've been in the applications cloud business for longer than we've been in the infrastructure cloud business. We're extremely strong in healthcare.\nCleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai, Providence St. Joseph, Adventist Health, Kaiser Permanente, National Health Service in the UK. Long list of providers. That's a partial list. They are using Oracle ERP, supply chain, and HCM applications. It's not just the clinical providers that are using our systems. The payers, the healthcare payers. Again, as we tackle healthcare in conjunction with our Cerner acquisition, we're not just automating providers. We're also automating payers. We're also automating pharmaceutical companies as they do clinical trials. We're trying to automate the entire ecosystem, not just a fraction of it. I mentioned the list of providers and payers: UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Humana, Highmark Health, Healthcare Service Corporations, Independent Blue Cross, Bright Health. Payers as well as providers. We're extremely strong in that. I mean, again, I'll just leave it with extremely strong.\nHealthcare wins in the Q, in Q2, Cigna, a huge payer win. Emirates Health Services, big provider win where we beat SAP. Cross Country Healthcare where we beat Workday and SAP. Henry Schein is a provider of healthcare products, and we won their data bank. Again, it is the entire healthcare infrastructure that we are focusing on as we try to automate healthcare systems around the world. Go lives in the quarter: Tenet Healthcare has 65 hospitals, 235,000 employees. They went live on HR, payroll, and recruiting. Cleveland Clinic is going live. I know it's called Cleveland Clinic, but they own hospitals all over the place. They've gone live in a bunch of regional hospitals in Florida. University of Chicago Medical Center has gone live. Baptist Healthcare has gone live, 12 hospitals with 26,000 employees. Lakeview Center has gone live in the quarter.\nWe're just getting stronger and stronger in healthcare. Let me move on to financial services, another industry that we deem very, very strategic and key to Oracle's future is financial services, specifically banking. We're very, very strong there. Bank of America, in terms of ERP, HCM, supply chain, our customers include Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, Vanguard, Santander, TD Bank in Canada, HSBC in the UK, UBS, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse, Sumitomo Mitsui, Macquarie Bank. It's a part of the list. We are extremely strong in the banking sector. What you're going to see in Oracle ERP with our strength in the banking sector is we will be offering loan origination for B2B commerce.\nOne of the things we're doing with the new version of Oracle ERP is if you're a customer that's buying something and you have Oracle ERP, and you are a company that's selling something and you have Oracle ERP, the way that B2B transaction will occur, it will be entirely automated within the cloud. You'll submit a purchase order. The buying ERP system will submit a purchase order to the selling ERP system. If you need to borrow money, we will originate a loan with one of our banking partners. If the product has to be shipped, we will schedule the shipping and track the shipment with one of our logistic partners. Our ambition here is to completely automate B2B commerce between buying and selling companies that are running Oracle Cloud ERP, and manage all of the financing, insurance, and logistics associated with that transaction.\nWe do a really good job, I think, of automating B2C transactions. Amazon does that extremely well. Walmart does that extremely well. We don't do a great job of automating B2B transactions. That's what Oracle's ambition is, to do that. We're in a great position because we are so strong in cloud ERP. It's an Oracle procurement system on one end of that transaction. It's an Oracle order management system on the other end of that transaction. We have very strong partners in finance, insurance, and logistics. We can completely automate the entire transaction where B2B transactions begin to look like B2C transactions. They're fully end-to-end automated. That's a huge new business for us and our partners. Okay. Let's see. Financial services wins in the quarter.\nWe've added M&T Bank, TD Bank, Daiwa Securities, Hilltop Holdings, Farmers Insurance, Nexi, which is where we replaced SAP at Nexi. It's an Italian bank. We replaced SAP at TD Bank. What else? Financial services, Go Lives, AM Trust, BlackRock, a big Go Live. They have $10 trillion of managed assets. Oracle now has nine of the top 10 asset management firms running on the Oracle Cloud ERP. FirstRand Bank, a bunch of other banks. I don't want to take up all the time, so I'm going to stop there. We have a lot more data on our website that will tell you, that will enumerate still more customers that we acquired in this very strong second Q, and that went live in the second Q. With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Safra.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nOkay. Thank you, Larry.\nBill, if you could prepare the audience for Q&A. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly, Mr. Bond. Ladies and gentlemen, just a reminder, star one, please, for any questions this afternoon. We'll take our first question today from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director and Senior US Software Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on the solid results. Larry, Oracle has a rich history of being a price performance leader in just about everything it does. Technically speaking, why exactly does OCI have an inherent cost advantage, and how sustainable is that advantage? Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nWell, maybe the most interesting thing is we have a much faster network than anybody else. We have a fundamentally different network than any of the other cloud providers. We have what's called an RDMA network that we had to build because our Exadata machines and our database actually glued together a lot of computers.\nWhen you had a single database application, that could run on one computer or it could run on a cluster of computers, two computers, four computers, eight computers, whatever, so that there was no single point of failure. One of the beauties of the Oracle Database, one of the big differences between the Oracle Database and other databases, is that the Oracle Database, a single application could run on multiple computers. If one of those computers would fail, the application would keep running. It was fault tolerant. It would tolerate a failure of a machine. Other people don't have that. In order to do that, we had to make our network. If we're going to have a cluster of four machines running a single database app, we have to make that network between those four machines very fast. That's called an RDMA network.\nIt means that one computer can immediately access the memory of another computer without going through an interrupt. It's a very fast way to interconnect computers and have them act as a group. We built that for our entire cloud so we could run our database, our Oracle Real Application Cluster database, on any of the computers in our cloud. Now, because we built this hyper-fast network, it turns out it has more utility than just running the Oracle database. If you're running a cluster of computers doing a simulation, a car crash simulation, that was one of the first applications people noticed ran much faster on Oracle. Now a much bigger application they noticed ran much faster on Oracle was neural networks and machine learning workloads run much faster on Oracle, because our network is just intrinsically much faster.\nThere are also their security and reliability advantages that go along with that. Our network's configured. We actually have all of our computers actually have two networks. I'm not going to go into all the details. Our computers are fundamentally different than any other cloud company. We have two networks, one of which is on the internet, or I'd say one of which interconnects all of our customers' computers, and the other, which is, if you will, our control network and computers that run our cloud control software, which is isolated from the customer software. The customer can't tamper with our cloud control software. They can't get control of it, and we can't see the customer's data. That is unique to Oracle.\nBecause we have the two networks and because one of the networks is RDMA, we just run much, much faster, much more reliably than they do. It's a fundamental advantage that they can't compete with unless they rebuild their cloud from scratch.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director and Senior US Software Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you, Larry.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take that question now from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse.\n\nPhil Winslow\n\nVP of Strategic Finance, Treasury, and Investor Relations, Cloudflare\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another strong quarter. Really, two metrics jumped out to me this quarter. First was IS revenue accelerated at 59% from 58% and then 39% in the prior two quarters. Organic RPA growth also accelerated to 28%, which is pretty phenomenal this Q from 22% and 17% in the prior 2Qs.\nCan you just give us sort of a breakdown of what's driving this continued strength compared to some of your cloud competitors in the past and IS world that have experienced decelerating growth in recent months? Are there any workloads in particular that are driving the relative strength of OCI?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nExecutive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors, Oracle\n\nI don't know, Larry. If you want to take it or I take it. I mean, you can take it.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nI mean, the workloads, I just didn't say on the workloads. AI and machine learning is exploding. NVIDIA, NVIDIA, the world, the people who provide the GPUs for most AI workloads, they're moving a huge amount of stuff to the Oracle Cloud. A bunch of other companies are doing that. That's one new one. I mean, obviously database, but I'll let that question really belong to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nExecutive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors, Oracle\n\nWell, it's really across the board, to be fair.\nWe've got high-performance computing. We've got most of the auto companies doing their simulations on us. We have Oracle workloads, autonomous database, and other workloads. We have extremely broad, just extremely broad moves. I think I told you in previous quarters that, of course, our growth rates are higher because we're smaller. Yet, as we grow, we're actually accelerating because of exactly the features that Larry covered in the last questions. Customers are coming to us, often not expecting the phenomenal results. Remember, time is money on the cloud. If you're more performant, it is much less expensive, whether it's Oracle workloads, straight compute, storage, or other workloads. The other thing is you have to understand that our cloud customers, our national security regions, all of those are being contracted.\nWe are clearly the choice for governments to maintain their sovereignty over their data. We can land a center very quickly, and they fill up very quickly. We really have it coming from all areas. Of course, our applications business, Larry basically said it. I mean, we're it, and we're winning consistently, deal after deal, both as our e-business suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards customers move to us, but also SAP installations choosing us over what they had before. It's just on all fronts, frankly.\n\nPhil Winslow\n\nVP of Strategic Finance, Treasury, and Investor Relations, Cloudflare\n\nGreat. Well, it's awesome to see everything that you've been talking about the past couple of years playing out. Keep up the great work.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nExecutive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors, Oracle\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to John Stephen DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThanks for taking my question. Larry, thanks for the answer to that first question.\nThat's actually something we've been thinking about. That's going to help as we dig in to better understand the benefits of OCI. It's amazing to hear the core differentiation of RAC continues to drive differentiation even 20 years later. My question is actually for Safra. Safra, you mentioned your flexible business model in your prepared remarks, which is unique. BYOL, you were a pioneer in doing that. License was surprisingly strong again. Can you talk in a little more detail about what's really driving that license strength?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nExecutive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors, Oracle\n\nContrary to, I think, the fears that people always have, the Oracle database is still the biggest part of license by far. Most important part, the database remains strong because customers understand that they can BYOL, bring your own license, and they can have coverage whether they're on-premise, in the cloud, or moving in between the two.\nAgain, really always the big number. We've got growth rates that are very strong in analytics. We have growth rates that are super strong in Java. We have growth rates that are strong in the industries areas, some of our industries applications. I want to make sure I gave you the numbers both ways. With Cerner, we have a growth rate of 23% because, of course, you had the Cerner license. Without Cerner, it's 9% growth. Even without Cerner, we have license growth after a very strong growth rate a full year ago in license. Again, big dog is, of course, technology. That's the bulk of it. We've got a few industry apps and a little bit of Cerner. It just remains just super strong.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nOkay. That makes sense. It sounds like a lot of things are working together here.\nThank you very much.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nExecutive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors, Oracle\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior Vice President, and Senior Research Analyst of Global Software, Sanford Bernstein\n\nThank you very much for taking the question. I really appreciate the ability to ask the question, and congratulations on the quarter. Two related questions on Cerner. Safra, where are we on the Cerner integration process as well as taking out the cost? Where do you think you can drive those long-term costs over time? Larry, we heard a lot of great futures at Oracle World about Cerner and what you can do in healthcare. Be interesting to hear what progress you've made recently. Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nExecutive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors, Oracle\n\nSure. Mark, we've owned Cerner for about five months, and I will tell you that they continue to do better than we had projected internally. We're very, very happy, but we are still at the beginning.\nWe don't want to do anything that will damage the business. Of course, we're very, very focused on those customers. We are already having some level of savings. Ultimately, just so that you understand, our expectation is we will run them at typical Oracle margins. We've got quite a way to go. I think over the next couple of quarters, you'll see continued improvement as we've done some of our operational integration. Simultaneously, I think they continue to overperform for us. We are doing this in a very careful way so as not to put any issues for our customers and making sure they're successful. On the technical side, Larry, that's for you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nYep. Well, actually, on the technical side, of course, what we're trying to do is build national, not just provider systems.\nIn other words, what Cerner did primarily in competition with Epic is they automated hospitals. Yes, we want to automate hospitals, clinics, and doctors' offices and do that. We certainly want to automate providers. What we're layering on top of that is we want to do national public health. We are doing national public health systems. I mentioned Oxford Nanopore. That's an early warning system to detect the next pathogen that could lead to a pandemic. These global public health systems need to be built. We are in discussions with not companies, but countries about building and deploying global early warning systems so we can detect the next pathogen that threatens to turn into a pandemic. We can catch it early enough that we can prevent it from being a pandemic.\nGod forbid there is another pandemic that we have up to the minute, up to the second data about how that country's infrastructure is managing the hospitalization rates, vaccination rates, and all of those things, so we can better deploy and manage our resources during a pandemic, so we do not have a repeat of the things that went on during COVID-19. I expect Safra just got back from visiting some prospective customers that are countries that we will be signing contracts with, a number of countries to build these national systems. These contracts are enormous. I mean, absolutely enormous. There will be several of them. As I said in my note in the press release, the scale of this healthcare opportunity is unprecedented, but so are the responsibilities that go along with it.\nWe have to, we as humanity has to do a better job of delivering healthcare to people than we have done historically. We can never have a repeat of the COVID-19 pandemic. I think there is this worldwide sense of urgency and national consciousness about getting a new generation of systems out there that help us first prevent and then manage our healthcare, prevent a pandemic, and better manage our healthcare systems. As far as I know, Oracle is the only company in the world that's trying to address this issue. We're about to sign up a number of countries that will work with us on doing just that.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior Vice President, and Senior Research Analyst of Global Software, Sanford Bernstein\n\nExcellent. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our final question this afternoon from [Ryan Lins Chow] at Barclays.\n\n[Analyst] (Barclays)\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks for squeezing me in. One quick question.\nIf you think about the global environment, usually it's not the time to look at, or in the olden days, I remember when I was at PWC, it wasn't the time to kind of look at your back-office systems, but you're kind of growing really nicely. NetSuite is actually kind of outgrowing now Fusion a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers and what you're seeing out there? Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nExecutive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors, Oracle\n\nYeah. Let me start that. Larry, you can add it if you want. I want to remind you that we are global, right, which includes whether we're in Europe and in the United States, but we're also in the Gulf States, and really in Asia, different parts, Latin America. There are always companies that get to the point where their business, they cannot afford to keep using their older systems.\nThey spend too much using them, they spend too much running them, and they are actually holding them back. They know that. I think one of the things many companies learned during COVID was those companies that did not get on some sort of a track to get a digital connection with their customers, employees, and suppliers were at a huge disadvantage. That momentum continues. It is possible that in any individual country or location, there could be some little slowdown here or there. Yet, there are other countries and industries that are doing incredibly well and that view this as critical. When customers move to SaaS, they end up spending less, but also have much better capabilities to sell more, to work with their employees and their suppliers, and, of course, as I said, their customers.\nThat momentum has started, has started, and it just continues very, very strongly. Again, we are global. Even when there are some issues in some region, we're in other regions that are doing phenomenally well right now.\n\n[Analyst] (Barclays)\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle\n\nThank you, Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn it back to Bo to close the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Mr. Bond. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude Oracle's Q2 2023 earnings conference call. Again, we'd like to thank you so much for joining us, and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye."

We had an excellent quarter with total revenue growing 23% in constant currency and beating the high end of our guidance. We also had a great organic quarter with total revenue growing 8% in constant currency. This was on top of a fantastic Q4 last quarter. As you can see from the numbers, we continue to get excellent returns on the investments we've been making over the last few years in product, infrastructure, and our sales organization. We are seeing company-specific and product-specific momentum. We continue to expect organic revenue growth in our cloud business will accelerate substantially in FY 2023. The currency headwind this quarter was much higher than the 3% headwind that was present when we gave guidance. It was actually 6 points, even though due to rounding, it may look like 5%, and that's a currency headwind to total revenue.\nIt was, in fact, 6 points. Yet we still exceeded our forecast on a reported basis, and we beat our constant currency revenue forecast by $200 million US dollars. We saw similar currency headwinds in EPS, which had an $0.08 US dollars negative effect, much worse than the $0.05 US dollars headwind present at the time of guidance in June. It's because of the significant and volatile swings in currencies that I always discuss our results using constant currency growth rate, so that you have a clear view of the business as we manage it. Now to the numbers, and there's a lot here. I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the results, excluding Cerner, which many of you are focused on. I hope you're pleased with our expanded disclosure this year.\nTotal cloud revenue, that's SaaS and IaaS, including Cerner, was $3.6 billion US dollars, up 45% in USD and up 50% in constant currency, with IaaS revenue a smidge under $900 million US dollars and SaaS revenue at $2.7 billion US dollars. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $8.4 billion US dollars, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by Fusion, Autonomous Database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4 billion US dollars, up 37% in constant currency. Q1 cloud application revenue, that's SaaS, was $2.7 billion US dollars, up 43% in USD, up 48% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, including support, were $4.4 billion US dollars, up 7% in constant currency. To be clear, that's actually 7% organic growth with no contribution from Cerner. Q1 cloud infrastructure, or IaaS revenue, was $0.9 billion US dollars, up 52% in USD, up 58% in constant currency, again with no contribution from Cerner.\nNow the revenue results, excluding Cerner. Total cloud revenue, that's IaaS plus SaaS, excluding Cerner, was up 29% in constant currency at $3.1 billion US dollars. Organic revenue growth for both IaaS and SaaS was significantly higher than last quarter. Application subscription revenues, excluding Cerner, were up 12% in constant currency. Our strategic back office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $5.8 billion US dollars and grew 33% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, which was up 38%, NetSuite ERP up 30%, and Fusion HCM up 26%. That means that SaaS revenues, excluding Cerner, were $2.2 billion US dollars, up 20%. Infrastructure cloud service revenue was up 58% in constant currency. Excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew 70% with an annualized revenue of $3.2 billion US dollars, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 103%, cloud at-customer consumption revenue, which was up 92%, and Autonomous Database, which was up 56%.\nIt's not only that our growth rates are higher than our hyperscale competitors—maybe you'd expect that because we're the newest and thus the smallest—but our growth rates are increasing as we get bigger. Our second-generation cloud launched after our competitor's first-generation cloud, and so we've been able to architect it more performantly, more securely, and more sustainably. As a result, as more companies test our cloud, they discover how much better it is on price, security, performance, and sustainability. In addition, we now have cloud regions in more countries and cities than AWS and Azure, giving our customers more choices for their sovereign data. Finally, many of our customers appreciate how flexible our service and business model is. All of this is amazing our customers, and I can't wait to share the stage with some of them at Oracle CloudWorld in October.\nNow, to license revenues, including Cerner, were $904 million US dollars, up 19% in constant currency, led by database options and Java. Total database revenues were up 3% in constant currency. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.4 billion US dollars, up 23% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner revenue of $1.4 billion US dollars, organic revenue was up 8% in constant currency. In addition, I want to point out that since we no longer operate in Russia, this negatively affected revenue by over 1 point of growth. Had we not left, actually our growth rate would be over 9% this quarter. Operating expenses were up 34%, mainly due to adding in Cerner's expenses and the mix of our business. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 81%, and the associated gross profit dollars grew 15% with Cerner, and 7% excluding Cerner.\nIn fact, the gross margin percentage on IaaS increased dramatically in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.5 billion US dollars, up 10% from last year, and I expect that we'll see strong operating income growth again in Q2. The operating margin, including Cerner, was 39%, which is lower than in the past since we only just began to integrate Cerner in the quarter. As we drive Cerner and its profitability to Oracle standards, and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow margin dollars, but also grow margin percentages significantly. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%, slightly above the guidance rate, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.03 in US dollars, unchanged in USD, and up 8% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.56 in US dollars, down 34%, and down 26% in constant currency. That's our GAAP EPS.\nOver the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $10.5 billion US dollars, and free cash flow was $5.4 billion US dollars, with capital expenditures of $5.2 billion US dollars. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $6.4 billion US dollars, and free cash flow was $4.7 billion US dollars, with capital expenditures of $1.7 billion US dollars. At quarter end, we had $11.2 billion US dollars in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $10.5 billion US dollars, up 11% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $60.7 billion US dollars, up 62% in constant currency due to strong bookings, as well as the addition of Cerner. However, I would note for you all that the organic RPO growth accelerated to 22% in Q1 from 17% in Q4. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.\nAs we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, and prudent use of debt and our dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for a total of $559 million US dollars. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.4 billion US dollars over the last 12 months, and the board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 US dollars per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue. Given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest, as there's strong demand for our cloud services. Now, let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I will provide on a non-GAAP basis. We are assuming the currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. That's not a prediction. That's just giving it to you as a translation as it currently is.\nIn that case, currency should have a 5% to 6% negative effect on total revenue and at least a $0.07 US dollars negative effect on EPS in Q2. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by quarter end. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 20.5%, which is up from 19.2% last year. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. Now to guidance. Total revenues for Q2, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 15% to 17% in USD. Total cloud growth, again including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency, and 42% to 46% in USD.\nI expect that total cloud growth for the fiscal year, excluding Cerner, will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 1% to 5% and be between $1.23 US dollars and $1.27 US dollars in constant currency. Again, due to currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS is expected to decline 1% to 5% and be between $1.16 US dollars and $1.20 in USD. As I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q2. With that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Safra. Last quarter, Microsoft and Oracle announced that we had built a high-speed interconnect between Microsoft's Azure Cloud and the Oracle Cloud. The purpose of this multi-cloud interconnect is to enable Azure customers to directly use the very latest Oracle database technology, even if their application is running in Azure. In other words, customers can now use any combination of Microsoft and Oracle Cloud services together, as if they were in one cloud. That was last quarter. This quarter, Oracle is making the latest version of our MySQL HeatWave database available in Amazon's AWS Cloud. Multiple published customer benchmarks have shown that MySQL HeatWave delivers seven times better performance than Amazon Redshift, 10x better performance than Snowflake, and up to 10x higher throughput than Amazon's own MySQL database called Aurora. The multi-cloud era has begun.\nCustomers are already buying applications and cloud infrastructure from several different providers, including Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Oracle, and others. Our job is to give our customers the ability to choose application and infrastructure technology from multiple clouds, and then have those different clouds coexist and interoperate gracefully. Multi-cloud interoperability is an important step in the evolution of cloud computing. Multi-cloud interoperability is one of the reasons our infrastructure business is booming, growing over 50% in US dollars and almost 60% in constant dollars. We expect Oracle's total cloud business to exceed a $20 billion US dollars annual run rate next year. Now, I'll highlight some of our big new infrastructure wins in Q1. Overall, we added about 1,000 new paying customers for infrastructure in Q1. Let's start off with NVIDIA.\nNVIDIA chose OCI to build their SaaS products for data scientists for machine learning and inferencing, along with moving their entire healthcare platform called Clara to OCI. Mosaic has developed a state-of-the-art neural network on OCI, and they picked OCI because OCI outperformed all of the other clouds when running machine learning and AI. The Avis Car Rental Company is moving their entire Oracle estate, along with their Oracle applications, to OCI. The Chicago Public Schools are closing data centers and migrating their Oracle estate to the Oracle Cloud. Tanium, a leader in cybersecurity, chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to help safeguard their customers with industry-leading security. OCI deployment will be a part of its multi-cloud strategy in delivering its SaaS platform, Tanium as a Service. Cigna, a healthcare company, is migrating their existing Exadata on-premise to the Oracle Cloud.\nAdditionally, their SaaS ERP system is being integrated with Oracle Cloud Digital Assistant. Tennessee and Oklahoma are both new government cloud customers. The first group of customers were all from North America. I just finished my list, beginning with NVIDIA in North America, and Tennessee and Oklahoma in North America. I am now going to move to wins in LAD. AT&T Mexico is the first case of any telco to move their entire Amdocs stack to a cloud, and they are moving their Amdocs stack to OCI's New Mexico cloud region. Avianca, one of the largest airlines in Latin America, will move all of their workloads to OCI. Entel, another telecom, in fact, the largest telecom in Chile, is now moving all of their critical workloads from AWS to OCI. Banco DigiPlus, a fintech bank in Brazil, is moving their entire on-premises VMware estate to run in OCI, 100%.\nSerasa Experian, a financial services company, is moving AI training for OCR, biometrics, and facial recognition to OCI. Bionexo, another infotech company in the healthcare business, serving 15,000 hospitals and clinics, is migrating their data lakes and their data warehouses from AWS to OCI. Santander, a large bank, is moving all of their databases from mainframes and Oracle databases all to the Oracle Exadata Cloud Service. Unimed, also a healthcare insurance company, is beginning the migration of all of their applications and database to OCI. Sky México, the largest satellite pay-TV producer in Mexico, will move all of their data lakes and all of their data warehouses to OCI in the New Mexico region. That's Latin America. In JAPAC, and maybe this is the most interesting customer I'll talk about, NRI, Nomura Research, is continuously expanding their dedicated cloud region in Japan.\nThey've just added a second data center. NRI has. The Oracle Cloud in Japan, the NRI Oracle Cloud in Japan, already runs 50% of all transactions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That's a mission-critical application. ICICI Bank, Financial Services, is a new customer in Japan Asia Pacific. Hitachi Construction in Japan is moving their critical manufacturing systems to OCI. AdTiming Technology and Infotech Company is a new customer in Asia Pacific. Daiichi Sankyo is the first big pharma in Japan that is moving their Oracle database workloads to the cloud. Pacific International Lines, the big transportation company, is a new customer in Asia Pacific. Li & Fung, a trading company, another new customer. Again, I mentioned we had 1,000 new customers this quarter in OCI. Poonawalla, another fintech company, is again another big new customer for us in Asia Pacific.\nH2O Retailing is moving their entire on-premise VMware estate to OCI. They're one of the largest retailers in Japan. Asian Development Bank is a new customer in Asia Pacific. [Hanjo Vision] is an infotech company, new customer. We have, again, a bunch of new customers in OCI all over the world. That's JAPAC. Now, let me move to EMEA. Dojo, a financial services company, chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for their payment platform because their benchmark showed that the Oracle Cloud OCI is more secure, and has better availability than the competition. Al Rajhi Bank, the world's largest Islamic bank, is in the process of moving all of its applications and databases to the Oracle Cloud. Unilever is integrating their Oracle Fusion applications with the Autonomous Database to build a next-generation super-secure, super-agile platform for Unilever.\nAtlantic Financial Group, an infotech company, hosts core banking functions on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which to many of their banking customers. Centric Co, an infotech company, is moving all their workloads from their old data centers to a combination of OCI, using OCI's multi-cloud services to access other clouds. Mio, a big telephone company, is moving over 300 Oracle databases to the Oracle Exadata Cloud. [NORC Tipping], a government agency, is migrating all databases off their IBM mainframes and Unix systems to the Oracle Database and to the Oracle Cloud. I'll close with the UK Home Office. The department is moving to the Oracle Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure with a focus on dramatically improving both security and reliability. With that, I'll turn it back over to Safra.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Larry. Josh, if you could go ahead and queue up the audience for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Hi, Safra and Larry. A little surprised to see your strong results here when most software companies, other than some of the pure security names, really faltered some against the macro backdrop. Frankly, you just didn't here. I want to focus the question on one area that we've gotten the most questions on since we launched coverage, and that's on organic constant currency cloud services growth. It looks like you came in above the high end of your guidance for the quarter, and you reiterated, Safra, that you expect greater than 30% growth for the year, which doesn't seem like a stretch like it did when you gave that first. We understand the way a subscription model works, but we obviously don't see everything that you see.\nCan you give us some more color around what's driving the results this quarter, and what gave you the confidence in this outlook for cloud services? Was it previously contracted revenue that's just starting to ramp up, was it expected increase in consumption, or something else, or all of the above?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLet me tell you, it is all of the above, but let me tell you what's really happening down at each customer level. When customers try us for some reason, whether they're using Fusion and they start using OCI for their own applications, or they hear really from word of mouth and from really a need to run some of their Oracle workloads or otherwise, when they give a try to Gen 2 OCI, or to Fusion for that matter, what they find is that it is phenomenal. Our Gen 2 Cloud is so much better than what they're used to and is so much more flexible and can be much more local, gives them so many more opportunities to really match to their own needs, but they're overwhelmed by the technical capabilities of our cloud and how great it is.\nWhat happens is they may start small, and then they accelerate in their consumption, and they sign larger and larger and more significant contracts. As you see in our RPO, there's a lot already contracted, and that's without us adding a single additional customer or expanding the use. We have, as I said, so much company-specific or product-specific momentum that as customers discover us, use us, give us a chance, they become honestly overwhelmed by our capabilities and how much less expensive, more flexible, more secure, and how differently we're architected such that we're also more sustainable for them. It is just incredible company-specific, product-specific momentum, and nothing really has to happen for us to continue to do very, very well here.\nWhether they're trying to save costs or expand growth, we help them do that in an incredibly flexible way and super, super cost-competitively for them.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah, let me just add one sentence to that. We are the only infrastructure company that builds enterprise-scale applications. As a result of building these enterprise-scale applications, we have made our infrastructure much, much better. We not only provide infrastructure and sell infrastructure, we consume the infrastructure ourselves. I think that gives us certain insights as to what we need to build at the infrastructure layer to make our applications secure, reliable, and so on, and easy to use, and make people productive.\nThat's why I think that's what a lot of customers are discovering when they come to our cloud, that they're more productive, that the system runs faster, it's more secure, it's easier to use, all of that. That's what gives us confidence that we can build the next generation of healthcare applications because we do both. We do both applications, enterprise applications, and infrastructure, and we're the only one.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nIt sounds like the expansion within your customer base of cloud services is becoming or has become more predictable, and that makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, John. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nPhil Winslow\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nHey, yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another strong quarter of organic growth. Obviously, Oracle has been delivering accelerating growth in its infrastructure and database businesses for multiple quarters now. Safra, could you give us some more color on just what the drivers are behind this and how sustainable they are, be it BYOL, database add-ons, autonomous database, etc.? A question for Larry. Obviously, the expanded partnership with Azure announced in July has received pretty universal positive feedback, and you just announced today that Oracle's MySQL HeatWave will be available on AWS. How do you think about these multi-cloud partnerships impacting the already positive existing momentum in your database business going forward?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLarry, why don't you go first, and then I'll fill in if you've missed anything. Yeah.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay, boss. I'll do that.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nRelated. Related.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, again, I think one of the issues I know a lot of people for years have been concerned about is can Oracle sustain its leading market share in the database business. I think what is clear is if our databases are available in multiple clouds, I think then the answer is clearly yes. If our database is not available in multiple clouds, then it's an interesting question whether we can maintain it just in our own cloud. We've decided to make our best and greatest technology available in multiple clouds, and that gives customers choice. They can use it in OCI. They can use MySQL HeatWave at AWS. They have choices, but they will be able to choose between, let's say, Amazon's Aurora or Oracle's MySQL HeatWave. They'll be able to choose between Snowflake or the Oracle Autonomous Database.\nI think as long as we're available in multiple clouds, we're going to be very strong and very, very competitive against these other companies and these other technologies.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThe answering for you on how's the Oracle Database doing? Well, you saw we had an amazing Q4, and in Q1, again, the Oracle Database is what people choose if they have real work to do. It's very secure, it's very performant, and they know it has so many capabilities that you don't have to have 16 different databases to get a complicated job done. You can do everything with it in different ways. The database options continue to be acquired. Many more customers still want enterprise agreements so they can BYOL, bring your own license to the Oracle Cloud. Our technology remains unbelievably strong with Java, and so the business overall, our tech business remains incredibly strong even though it's enormous.\nFor many, many of the reasons, I think there was a period a few years back where folks were thinking they would try lots of other things and things that were maybe more fashionable. I think they've realized that actually getting your job done securely, performantly, sustainably, and also really least expensive is to actually use our products to do that. They've been doubling down, committing, and bringing those workloads to the Oracle Cloud, again propelling just incredible momentum, whether it's clouded customer, dedicated regions, or our public cloud.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Phil. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior VP, and Senior Research Analyst of Global Software, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much for taking the question, and congratulations on the strong quarter. Larry, Safra, historically, in increasingly difficult economic conditions, organizations focused on what drove revenue growth or immediate savings, and products like Salesforce Automation or similar areas received funding while back office projects were delayed. What is different this time, both from an ERP point of view and an HCM point of view? What's going to drive the sustained growth and strength that you're expecting in Oracle's strategic back office? Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nSure. Let me start by, since I'm also the principal financial officer, if I was at another company, I'd be the one making the decision to buy Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM. What is absolutely clear is that saving money in the back office is basically automatic when you use our products. When you move from, especially from our competitors' products, which are so expensive to maintain and to run, when you move to Fusion, you can save so much in your back office that you can use that money to invest in things that help you extend the differentiation of your business. Now, today's the 12th of September. In fact, I signed off with our auditors on Friday, but we don't do our earnings on Friday, so we had to wait all the way till Monday.\nNow, no other companies report on the ninth or the eighth day. In fact, most companies were reporting their July quarter last week, and here we are announcing an August quarter. Well, what does that have to do with costs? Well, I can tell you that when you are in a position to know your results and to announce them and to file your earnings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you've not only saved time, you've saved million in process dollars and in the way you run your business.\nI just want to point out that we were able to do this after acquiring in the quarter Cerner by putting their data from their old system into Fusion and consolidating it in Fusion. We actually believe that one of the most important ways to drive business transformation is to move to a much more streamlined cloud product than running old back office systems.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nLet me just add one thing. I'm sorry. Let me add one thing, which is Safra addressed the issue of modernizing back office to save money. Let me tell you another way you can save money. I personally have been talking to some of Amazon's most famous brands that are running at AWS. The AWS bill is getting very large, and they can save a huge amount of money by moving to OCI. I expect next quarter we'll be announcing some brands, some companies moving off of Amazon to OCI that will shock you. I'll stop there.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior VP, and Senior Research Analyst of Global Software, Bernstein Research\n\nAmazing. Congrats.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, Cowen & Company\n\nOh, great. Thanks. Safra and Larry, congratulations. Larry, thanks for all the color on the OCI wins. I was hoping to get an update on your go-to-market strategy for OCI, and it's clearly becoming a more critical growth driver for you guys. Is there a dedicated Salesforce? Are you doing more bundling of OCI with other offerings? Just hoping to get an update on how you're going to market and what kind of resources you're putting around OCI because with 58% growth, it certainly seems like you're now gaining share in the cloud infrastructure market, and it's a big market to go after. Any color on that would be helpful.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nLet me start, Larry. Oh, you go ahead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nAbsolutely. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nI'll do what I'm told.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay, one of the enormous changes we made in the past year or so, year or two, is that we have invested in a lot more engineering talent in the field to help our customers bring over workloads. Once we've shown them how to do it and the enormous benefit they get by doing it, this is the ultimate sales accelerator because there's nothing like a customer who realizes that our solution is just so much better and so much less expensive for them. You have to do that often by, let's say, priming the pump, by sending engineers, field engineers, who can help the customers move those workloads. That's really propelled what's been going on in our OCI Cloud. Larry, you go ahead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. I think exactly what Safra said, and I'll add what I just repeat what I said earlier. The amount of money these huge companies, these very famous companies, spend with Amazon is kind of staggering. I mean, everyone assumes, I moved to the cloud and I save a lot of money. It depends which cloud you move to. Oracle is much less expensive than the competition, partially because we're faster, which, time is money when you're paying by the hour. Again, I'm going to repeat. We're talking to the most famous brands that are running at Amazon, and some of them are going to be moving very soon.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, Cowen & Company\n\nExciting. Thank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Derrick. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nExcellent. Thank you. Congrats on the solid execution. Larry, we've heard of some very exciting things happening with Cerner pretty quickly after the deal just closed, with some hospital networks we heard from significantly expanding their existing contracts. Can you talk about the unique value you're able to deliver now that Cerner is a part of Oracle and the broader expansion opportunity that you see ahead? If I could just sneak in one for you as well, Safra, $1.7 billion US dollars in CapEx in Q1 is a pretty big number, and I know very well that you don't spend frivolously. What can you tell us about the big step up here?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay. I'll go first. By the way, $1.7 billion US dollars CapEx is there's just so much demand. Safra mentioned we have more data centers in more countries, and in more cities than either Amazon or AWS. We're expanding because the demand is there. We expect to be growing in the 50% range for cloud services, and that means we're going to have to be adding a lot of data center capacity and opening a lot of new data centers, and we're doing that. The fact that we're running, or an Oracle cloud data center is running, half of Tokyo Stock Exchange. Ask the other cloud vendors how many stock exchanges they run. Our stuff is very secure, it's very reliable, it's very performant, it's very, very cost-effective, and we have huge opportunity. Therefore, we're spending the money to expand.\nWe have a huge opportunity for growth, and we're not going to miss it. We're still going to be, as you know, Safra is very cautious. We're always very cautious. We pay a lot of attention to profitability, but we also have to pay attention to the top line as well as the bottom line, and take advantage of this growth opportunity. I think there was a second part to the question that maybe I didn't answer.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nHe asked you all about Cerner.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle Corporation\n\nOh, Cerner. A big other part. Yeah. One of the things I think that we don't really talk about, but I alluded to the fact that we both build applications, and we run them on our infrastructure. The tools we use for building applications, our latest generation of tools, are the autonomous database, very different from all the Oracle databases or any other database that came before. There are no DBAs. There is no human labor associated with running the Oracle database anymore, so there can be no human error. The costs are so much cheaper. Our own internal cloud, OCI, uses autonomous database to run all the control systems because Clay Magouyrk doesn't want to hire a lot of DBAs. It's a lower cost. Also, he doesn't want to have any errors of a commission. It's much more reliable than when you have human beings driving the car.\nWe use that for the next generation of Cerner, the Oracle Autonomous Database. We pair that with an all-new application development tool called APEX, which is a low-code tool. Our newest applications, our very newest applications that we are building, we're building in the autonomous database with APEX, which allows us to do stuff that would have taken three or four years in less than a year. We expect to have our first pretty complete new Cerner health management product out within 12 months, which I think is going to again, it's something we never could have done with the previous generation of databases or the previous generation of application development tools. All of that has changed. We have these phenomenal low-code tools. One of the things about the low-code tool is you don't have to do security audits because security is built into the tool.\nYou can't build an insecure application using APEX. Fault tolerance is built into the tool. If the application should fail, it's a stateless application, so it could immediately fail over into another data center in a millisecond and keep running. No one will even know about the failure. Our new generation of application development tools is going to enable us to modernize the Cerner technology at a rate that would be inconceivable a couple of years ago.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nAmazing. Thank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Brad. That does appear to be our last question. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Josh for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect."

Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or to give new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter across the board, with total revenue growing 10% in constant currency, the highest organic growth we've seen since 2011, and $240 million above the high end of my constant currency guidance. Earnings were equally strong, as EPS was $0.20 above the high end of guidance. What Q4 demonstrates is that our business is accelerating.\nA growing list of customers, many new to Oracle, are choosing us for more products and services as they understand the benefits of Oracle technology. Our technology helps make our customers modern, efficient, and more productive, and they got to see that during the pandemic, and now it's very clear. Those customers are then becoming larger Oracle customers. Fusion customers are buying OCI. OCI customers are buying Fusion and NetSuite. Database customers are moving to Autonomous on OCI.\nIndustry vertical customers are going all in on Fusion. We have real momentum all around. Going forward, despite the macro environment, we continue to expect the revenue growth in our cloud business will accelerate substantially in fiscal year 2023. We're also excited about completing the Cerner acquisition. Larry spoke at our Oracle Health Strategy session last week, and he'll give you more details today, and I'll fill in with some numbers.\nAs you can see in the financial statements, the currency headwind this past quarter was 5%, which was considerably higher than the 2% to 3% it was during our last earnings call. Following my regular custom, I'll be reviewing our non-GAAP USD results using constant currency growth rates, so you have a clear view of the business as we manage it. Now for Q4.\nTotal cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.6 billion, up 7% in constant currency, again driven by Fusion, NetSuite, Autonomous Database, and, of course, Gen 2 OCI. Total cloud revenues, that's IaaS plus SaaS, was $2.5 billion in USD, up 22% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues were $3.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency.\nOur strategic back office cloud applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.4 billion and grew 24% in constant currency this quarter, including Fusion ERP, up 23%, and NetSuite ERP, up 30%. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $3.2 billion, and, excluding our legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew 49%, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 83%, cloud customer consumption revenue, which was up 108%, and Autonomous Database, which was up 29%.\nLicense revenues were $2.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency, led by database sales for use in the cloud by major application cloud SaaS companies. As a result, our database business had an exceptional quarter with total database revenue up double digits. All in, total revenue for the quarter were $11.8 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 11% as we continued to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services.\nFor the quarter, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 82%, and the gross profit dollars grew 4%. The full year growth of this gross profit was 4%, higher than the 2% we saw last year, and I expect it will be significantly higher in FY 2023. Though we will continue to invest in growth, we should benefit from economies of scale of running our cloud business as it gets larger.\nYou should keep in mind that our fundamental principle going forward is to grow non-GAAP EPS while accelerating cloud revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.6 billion, up 8% from last year, and the operating margin was 47%, once again higher than all of our competitors. Even while we've been investing aggressively for growth, we've maintained our financial discipline. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.1%, below our base tax rate of 19%, as we received a benefit from the resolution of some tax matters in Q4.\nEPS was $1.54 in US dollars, up 7% in constant currency, unchanged in USD. GAAP EPS was $1.16, down 8% in constant currency, down 15% in USD. Now, let me go through the full fiscal year, though I've given you some full year numbers so far every once in a while. For the full fiscal year, total company revenues were $42.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency, and our highest annual growth rate in more than 10 years. Total applications revenue grew 8% compared to 5% last year, and total infrastructure revenue grew 7% compared to 2% growth last year.\nClearly, our revenue growth accelerated this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the year was $30.2 billion, up 6%. Total cloud services were up 22% to $10.8 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.90 in USD, up 5% in USD, up 8% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 46%, up 2% from pre-pandemic levels, and down a little bit, down 1% from last year.\nOperating cash flow over the last four quarters was $9.5 billion, and free cash flow was $5 billion, with capital expenditures of $4.5 billion during the year. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $4 billion, and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. At quarter end, we had nearly $22 billion in cash and marketable securities, but that's lower now that Cerner has closed. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.4 billion, up slightly in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance, is $46.6 billion, up 17% in constant currency due to strong bookings.\nApproximately 57% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for a total of $600 million.\nIn addition, we paid out dividends of $3.5 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. With the completion of the Cerner acquisition, which happened after the end of Q4, actually, I guess last week, we've added about $15.8 billion of debt, and we anticipate retaining our investment-grade credit rating, meaning that for the time being, we're going to focus on reducing our debt balance while continuing our share repurchases at current levels. In addition, I don't believe the dividend will be impacted at all. Once the debt level has declined, we'll reexamine share repurchase levels.\nNow to the guidance. We feel very optimistic about our business momentum, and we also recognize that there is increasing macro uncertainty right now. In addition, since we ceased operations in Russia in March and made other adjustments in the region, we have factored out around $100 million per quarter from guidance that we used to receive from these customers. Taking all that into account, I do expect our cloud business, which grew 22% this year, will organically grow more than 30% in constant currency in FY 2023. Cloud service and license support will also see growth acceleration, and could well see double-digit organic growth.\nAs I said earlier, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while accelerating cloud revenue growth. Given our increasing confidence in organic revenue growth, we will continue to prudently invest back in the business, and you can already see the returns in our performance. Revenue growth accelerated from 2% in FY 2021 to 7% this year. Clearly, there's strong demand for our cloud services, and we intend to capitalize on it.\nAs such, I expect our CapEx spend will be higher in FY 2023 to meet the demand. We expect to add another six regions in fiscal 2023, in addition to the 38 cloud regions across 20 countries that we have already serving our customers. I also want to share how we will be running Cerner, since it will impact their contribution to Oracle going forward. We are already working actively to build and implement world-class healthcare cloud capabilities. Larry will go over that. This means that we are reviewing their entire product portfolio to identify areas where we can include Oracle technology rather than third-party products, as well as moving them to OCI.\nThese efforts will deliver a more stable, secure, and innovative product portfolio for customers, while using less third-party products. We remain confident in our ability to grow Cerner's top line and bottom line faster than they were able to do so on their own as these changes are implemented. Now let me turn to my guidance. I'll review Q1 on a non-GAAP basis, and if currency exchange rates remained the same as they are now, currency should have a 3% to 4% negative impact on total revenue, and maybe $0.05 to $0.06 negative effect on EPS in Q1.\nHowever, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 20% to 22% in constant currency and are expected to grow 19% in USD at today's exchange rate. As with past acquisitions, I've added conservatism for the Cerner revenue contribution to account for the transition. For Q1, total cloud excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 25% to 28% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 22% to 25% in USD. As I mentioned above, for fiscal year 2023, total cloud excluding Cerner is expected to grow over 30% in constant currency.\nTotal cloud growth in Q1, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 47% to 50% in constant currency, 44% to 47% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 6% and 10% and be between $1.09 and $1.13 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 1% and 5% and be between $1.04 and $1.08 in USD. As I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including Q1. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Safra. As Safra said, our plan is to accelerate cloud revenue growth while continuing to grow earnings per share. First, let me provide some detail on how we plan to accelerate cloud revenue growth. It all starts with our two most important verticals: healthcare and financial services. In healthcare, we're in the process of building a complete suite of applications for the entire healthcare ecosystem, starting with healthcare providers like hospitals and clinics.\nWe're modernizing Cerner's clinical systems by adding capabilities like a voice user interface, and applications like disease-specific AI models for cancer and other diseases. We're including an IoT device network to improve patient diagnostics and monitoring. We're adding administrative systems, including managing the incredibly complex contract workforce that hospitals have, as doctors are not full-time employees, nor are nurses. We are going to help recruiting, scheduling, and paying those contract workers according to their contracts. Inventory at hospitals is enormously complicated.\nInventories aren't in a central location. You find inventory in nurses' stations, outside operating rooms, outside the intensive care unit. There's inventory everywhere. Managing that inventory is very complicated. We're adding RFID tags and maps on handheld phones to help people find what they're looking for quickly. For payers, including insurance companies and governments, we're automating payment authorization and billing systems. For pharmaceutical companies, we're integrating our clinical trial system directly into the hospital clinical system, making clinical trials easier to start and faster to complete.\nWe can do all of this and more because we're building these healthcare applications using the latest, most productive technologies in the cloud, namely the Oracle Autonomous Database and the APEX low-code programming language. Using these tools, security and reliability are built into the technology platform, not the application. In our financial services vertical, we're working with major money center banks and leading logistics companies to automate B2B commerce from directly within the Oracle ERP cloud.\nFor example, when a hospital wants to buy an X-ray machine, that hospital simply enters a purchase request for the X-ray machine into their Oracle ERP procurement system. That procurement system then sends that order directly to the selling company's Oracle ERP order management system, and automatically originates a corresponding loan request from that hospital's peferred bank. The company selling the X-ray machine uses their Oracle ERP order management system to check product availability and submit a shipping request to their preferred logistics provider to automatically quote a delivery date to the buyer.\nThe entire B2B commerce process is automated within the Oracle Cloud: purchasing, selling, loan origination, shipping, billing, and payments. Automating B2B commerce is yet another huge opportunity for Oracle. We already have over 30,000 cloud ERP customers, including many of the world's most important banks, and leading logistics companies. Let's take a moment to look at the progress we continue to make in our Oracle ERP Cloud, starting with healthcare. We've got a very strong position in healthcare with the providers, including Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Mount Sinai, Northwell Health, Tenet, Atrium Health, Highmark Health, Humana, Cigna, and many others. In Q4, we closed United Healthcare, a win over SAP.\nWe won the NHS, the UK's second major move to the cloud. We won New South Wales Ministry of Health in Australia for ERP and SCM. We won WellSpan, a regional provider in Pennsylvania with eight hospitals. We won Abcam, a UK life sciences company, increasing their footprint in ERP and SCM. Going live in Q4 were the Cleveland Clinic with ERP and SCM, UC Health for ERP and SCM, Pfizer on enterprise performance management, UK Health went live, Atrium Health went live, all in Q4. In financial services, our other really big vertical, as I said earlier, we have a very strong position with the money center banks with ERP.\nBank of America uses Fusion applications, JP Morgan Chase uses Fusion applications. So does Santander, Bank New York Mellon, HSBC, Lloyds, McCrory, Credit Suisse, UBS, Credit Agricole, SMFB, TD Bank, Societe Generale, Vanguard, and State Street. I can go on and on, but let me go to the results in Q4. In Q4, we won at Citibank, a big ERP win against SAP. We won at Chubb. We won at PNC, the sixth largest bank in the United States. We won at SMBC, the largest Japanese-owned bank in the United States.\nWe won Overseas China Banking Corp. We won Mizuho, the third largest bank in Japan, TIAA, Desjardins, Mitsui Sumitomo, also in Japan, GNP, one of Mexico's largest financial services companies. We have a very, very strong position in financial services. That's one of the key groups of partners where we're working to automate B2B commerce along with the logistics companies. In retail, we won—well, we already have Kohl's, Office Depot, Macy's, Kroger, Albertsons, Tesco, McDonald's, Chipotle, Tiffany, Saks, Williams-Sonoma, Walmart, CVS. In Q4, we added to that list.\nWe added Lowe's, Albertsons, Sherwin-Williams, and Abercrombie & Fitch. We had major go-lives at Macy's, Nextdoor, and the Co-op stores, all in retail. In communications, where we're already present at AT&T, Orange, MTN, Bharti Airtel, Rogers, Wind Tre, Telecom Italia, KPN, and SCC, we won Virgin Media. We had a major expansion at AT&T and ERP, SCM expansion. We won a major expansion, ERP and EPM, at Verizon. Very, very strong quarter in telecommunications with a huge go-live at KPN, the Dutch telecom company, in ERP and SCM. Service wins, we already have PwC, KPMG, Booz Allen, TrueBlue, Securitas, Waste Management, Skanska, McDermott, and Jacobs.\nWe won in Q4 BDO, Verisk Analytics, and the Modopalo Group. Go-lives in Q4 in services included Price Waterhouse, Manpower Group, TriNet, and Republic Services. In the public sector, we had a major win at the State of Missouri, wall-to-wall at the State of Missouri, ERP, SCM, HCM. That was a win over Workday, SAP, and everybody else. We won at the Scottish government, we won at the UK Home Office, we won a state of Switzerland, Bern, we won General Organization for Social Insurance in Saudi Arabia, and we won a deal with the police department in the State of Victoria in Australia.\nWe had major go-lives in public sector in the City of St. Louis and Norfolk County, UK. In hospitality, where we already have Marriott, Hilton, Caesars, MGM, Lowe's, Royal Caribbean, and Park Hotels, we added Airbnb for ERP expansion, a win over Workday, and Intercontinental Hotels and Resorts. Logistics, again, this is our other big group of partners in our major effort to automate B2B commerce from within the Oracle ERP cloud. We have a very strong position globally in logistics.\nOur customers include UPS, FedEx, DHL, Swift, Schneider, Union Pacific, and Yellow. We added An Post, the postal service of Ireland. The go-lives included DHL, UPS, and Deutsche Post. In higher ed, where we're already installed at Princeton, Cambridge, Juilliard, Vanderbilt, UCLA, University of Chicago, Edinburgh, Rutgers, Baylor, UCSD, and lots and lots of others, we added the University of Maine, East Tennessee State, Villanova, and the State University of New York at Stony Brook.\nOther notable wins in the quarter on high tech, we won Teradata. We won a big win at Toyota Motor and an ERP win at Denso. Again, let's see what else we got. Very global. Let's see. Aaptiv was another ERP win in energy tech, energy. Okay. It was a very, very strong quarter. We're very excited about our momentum in ERP and how we can expand ERP from what it was when it was an on-premise system to what it can be in terms of B2B commerce automation now that it's a cloud system. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you, Larry. David, if you'd please pull the audience for questions, we'll go to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. At this time, I'd like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYes. Thank you very much, and congratulations on the double-digit growth in the quarter. Larry, your vision of a national health records database is very compelling. It would be a profound benefit to society. Just considering that several trillion dollars are spent on healthcare, what do you see as the size of the opportunity for Oracle and Cerner if you solve that particular problem?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, the national health records database solves two problems. It allows patients, in the case of an emergency, to have their caregivers get immediate access to all of their health records, which will deliver way better outcomes for people. The other is public health officials will get much better information about the state of health in their country. I mean, the amount of having this knowledge, we dramatically improve healthcare, but we also save an enormous amount of money by doing that.\nI don't know if you remember when we sent that hospital ship to New York City because the officials in New York thought they were about to run out of hospital beds. It turns out they were wrong. We didn't run out of hospital beds, but they didn't know. Public health officials don't have access to that kind of information. They're a bit flying. It was very clear there, in a lot of cases, they were flying blind during the pandemic. By providing this information, we save a lot of lives, and we save a lot of money. The scale of the opportunity is gigantic because people think of it as a national opportunity. It's a global opportunity. Every country, I mean, if you look at Western Europe, Western Europe's budgets are dominated by healthcare.\nIf they can save lives and save money by putting in modern information systems, they'll do it, and they'll do it quickly. It's clearly going to be our largest business.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line's open.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the questions, and congratulations on a really solid quarter. Safra, you mentioned on the conference call that you guys are putting up this type of result, even on a backdrop that's not the most stable kind of macro backdrop. We're seeing a lot of other software companies seeing slip deals, seeing issues with consumer internet companies lowering their spend. You guys seem to be working through this very well. Can you give us some color into how you're doing it? Is it better execution? Is the Oracle value proposition going through more clearly? Can you help us understand where you're able to put up the bigger beats when a lot of guys are working with skinnier beats at all during this period?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nOkay. Well, first of all, you have to understand we're a very big company. We have thousands, hundreds of thousands of existing customers. Our products also are so compelling that often customers save money by moving to OCI. Also, many of our customers realized during the pandemic that they absolutely had to have modern systems. Those companies that didn't have modern systems barely survived through the pandemic. They have to have a digital connection with their customers, with their employees, with their suppliers. Those are the kinds of products we have.\nWhen customers move, let's say, from Amazon to us, the moment they try us, they realize, whoa, this is better and more economical. Of course, for Oracle workloads, you can't get anywhere close to what we can do. We have a lot of things working in our favor. Our products, of course, our Fusion products are superb. I mean, we have so many customers. This call is not long enough to reach them. Of course, NetSuite is, again, industry-leading like Fusion for a different part of the market, incredible momentum. Now, by the way, as I mentioned, there's about $100 million a quarter that is just the Russia-Ukraine region. We stopped charging our customers in Ukraine when they were invaded, even though we continue to help them. Of course, we suspended everything in Russia.\nWe are just trying to meet our customers' needs. The biggest issue is having enough to meet demand. I'm actually very happy with the way we managed the supply chain this past quarter. I'm hoping that it will continue to get better because that will give us more capacity and more capability to deliver to our customers. I mean, we just have so much momentum. We have so many happy customers, and new customers are just buying more. You get into this cycle that's very virtuous. People really build confidence in our capability to execute, and also the overall economic message and offering that we're giving. We've always tried to give a compelling financial offering, and I think that's really resonating in these times.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Super helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Keith. Next, we'll go to Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nSoftware Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for taking my questions, and congrats on the great results. Larry, we've picked up a meaningful uptick in the number of large enterprise agreements or ULAs that customers are doing with Oracle, in particular to satisfy their database needs both on-premise and also in the cloud. Do you have any telemetry or other insights into customer behavior to see where they're deploying these licenses? Can you talk about why BYOL is so important to your strategy and the longevity of Oracle Database? Maybe just for Safra as well, that license number was so strong. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned license growth was led by database use in the cloud by major app cloud SaaS companies. Just wondering if there's any more color you can provide there. Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. With the exception of Workday, most of the big application companies, maybe conspicuously Salesforce.com, is a very large Oracle user. They license our database for use in their cloud. They're not the only ones. There are a lot of SaaS companies that use our database in the cloud, and that keeps our license business very, very strong. Our database license business is very, very strong. Don't confuse license for on-premise. Some licenses classically are used on-premise, but a lot of the new licenses that we're selling allow customers to take those licenses and run them in the cloud, whether it's our cloud or other people's clouds, or in the case of Salesforce, in their own cloud. The Oracle Database is still the number one database in the world by a significant margin.\nIt's the number one database in the cloud when you start counting all of the SaaS companies that use the Oracle Database.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nSoftware Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line's open.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much, and congratulations on the strong quarter and the very positive commentary and guidance. I'd like to drill a little more on this question of people's concerns. With the increasing concerns of recession by many, can you tell me what you're seeing for the apps part of the business, and more specifically for ERP? What I'm trying to understand is how will the shift of ERP to the cloud be impacted by any economic slowdown, or won't it be? How should we think about that? Thank you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nWell, I'm not sure I'd call it counter—I'm sorry, Safra. Please go.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nNo, you go ahead, Larry. You go ahead.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. Okay. I'm not sure I'd call it countercyclical, but the cloud systems cost a lot less than the on-premise systems to run, and they give you much better information. They allow you to control expenses better. They don't cost that much to implement because you pay for them over time. What we're seeing is—let's take a look at NetSuite, which is the low end of the market. You think those would be the companies to be most affected by the recession. It's not JP Morgan Chase. They'll keep putting in new systems. Some smaller entrepreneur-led companies, you think that the recession, we get them. We got the most revenue we ever got from NetSuite this past quarter, and the highest growth rate that we've ever gotten from NetSuite this past quarter.\nThey are accelerating into the recession because we think the benefits are enormous. It equips the companies to compete more effectively. We don't see that business slowing down. Quite the contrary, we see our ERP business, both Fusion and NetSuite, accelerating, even in spite of the macroeconomic situation. Safra?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYeah. I think people don't realize how exorbitantly expensive it is to run those large SAP systems. They have data centers associated with them, they have hundreds, sometimes thousands of technicians to run them. They're old, they're clunky, and moving to Fusion ERP, it's just a totally different world. The costs are tiny in comparison. I think people sort of forget that. This applies really to all on-premise systems, but even more so to those old SAP systems. Our cloud offering in that area really is unrivaled, frankly, unrivaled. Our win rates just continue.\nWe're very optimistic about it. We've sold a lot. A lot is still being implemented. We expect that you'll see that in the numbers while our customers end up spending less than what they used to spend with on-premise.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nPerfect. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Again, congratulations.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nThank you. Okay.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n\nPhil Winslow\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter, Safra, you expected organic revenue growth to reach double digits next fiscal year. Congratulations on reaching that double-digit milestone this quarter. Now, within today's results, two numbers really stood out to us. First was the upside to license revenue. Second was your commentary about total database revenue growing in the double digits.\nMy question is, Safra and Larry, can you give us more color on what's driving that reacceleration in license revenue in particular, even as cloud revenue inflected to its highest growth rate in more than four years? Is this BYOL bringing the heat? Is this autonomous database getting big enough and growing fast enough to lift the overall number, etc.? Is this the broad-based demand that you mentioned on the Q3 call, or is this more big deal-driven? Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nIt's a little of both. First of all, large enterprises understand that having an unlimited agreement for some period of time gives them unbelievable flexibility. Any large customer, large database user that does not have an unlimited agreement with us is really not optimizing for their spend because it gives them incredible flexibility.They can use on-premise for as long as they need it.\nThey can move to the cloud and get a much lower price in the cloud with BYOL. They can move back and forth. It just gives them the kind of flexibility. Those agreements are the ultimate sort of the foundation of so much of what goes on. In addition, of course, in technology, we also have our leading Java business, which on-premise is in extensive use and in the cloud is at no charge. Customers can be motivated to bring their Java to the Oracle Cloud and to use it at no charge, their Java program, and to use it at no charge. We have a lot of things that incent bringing your Oracle databases to our cloud and, of course, all your Java work to our cloud.\nBoth of those are absolutely critical for our license numbers to be as strong as they are. The Oracle Database, I've been following Oracle for, well, since the '80s. We always hear about some new product that's about to overtake Oracle. The reality is that the Oracle Database is beyond the gold standard. If you really need work done, and if you want to protect your most critical data and you want to use large amounts of it, it is going to be the Oracle Database that is head and shoulders above every other product. Invariably, some folks try other things.\nWhen they get bigger, they always come back to the Oracle Database. It is irreplaceable because of its technical capabilities that are so far superior. That becomes very, very, very clear to customers. More and more of them license, continue their license, and extend those unlimited agreements, whether for on-premise and in the cloud. It's not either/or. It's both, and that is the best use of it.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nI want to add something.\n\nPhil Winslow\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nAwesome. Thanks for the comment. Yep. Sorry. Go ahead, Larry.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nGo ahead, Larry.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nCTO, Oracle Corporation\n\nI'll add one thing to that, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database is interesting because it's autonomous. In other words, it doesn't require human beings to run it, like database administrators, things like that. Recently, inside of Oracle, inside of our cloud, virtually every database going up to run our cloud is the autonomous database because people don't want to hire database administrators inside of Oracle Corporation. It's just much cheaper to run, and I think in that sense, the autonomous database is countercyclical.\nYou do save a huge amount of money just by moving from the conventional Oracle Database to the Autonomous Database. It's actually more secure, more reliable, and costs way less to run. You don't need a bunch of experts running it. You don't need anyone to run it. There's a programming language called APEX which is a low-code programming environment where you use 10% the amount of programmers that you would use if you were programming in our other programming language called Java.\nAPEX is also becoming very popular inside of Oracle to build applications. I see this as two interesting trends as people using more modern technology to dramatically reduce their labor costs, which I think will play very well in the next couple of years in this economy.\n\nPhil Winslow\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nAwesome. Thanks for the added color. Appreciate it. Keep up the good work.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line's open.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks very much. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a good quarter. Safra, can you just give any additional color on the CapEx outlook for fiscal 2023 relative to what we saw this year? Just to clarify on the buyback, I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. Is the pace of buyback that we saw this last quarter still reasonable for the near term, even with the incremental debt from Cerner? Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle Corporation\n\nYes. Let me hit the buyback first because I know I gave you quite a word sandwich there at the end. I was losing steam. We bought back $600 million this past quarter. I think we bought back about $600 million the previous quarter. I expect to do about the same this quarter. Usually, I don't give you the number in advance. Since previous quarter, to those two, we did $7 billion and a couple of $8 billions. We're not going to be at that level. We'll be at the $600 million for a few quarters until I see where our debt levels are. $600 million a quarter is probably what I'm targeting. It could be a little bit more, potentially.\nThat's kind of where I'm at. Oh, on CapEx. You noticed how I mentioned how many regions we have. We have just put up so many regions over the past year and a half or two. I think we now have more than Amazon, or I think we do already have more than Amazon already. We are going to build another six, and we're going to expand the ones that we have because they are being used so extensively in many cases. They are spoken for. I expect CapEx, which was where it was this year, I think it'll be a little bit more than what it was next year. I'll be giving a little bit more detailed guidance as I see it playing out over the year.\nWe have so much—I mean, we have so much cloud demand that I am going to continue to spend in capital expenditure. I do believe that as a percentage of our revenue growth, I think I'll start really feeling those economies of scale and increasing my gross margins and my operating margins significantly.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you all.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Oracle Corporation\n\nA telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the investor relations website. Thanks for joining us today. With that, I'll turn it back to David for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nsThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Q3 Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from the Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website following this call. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, and CEO Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K, 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. However, we will be making no comments regarding Cerner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by acknowledging the tragic events unfolding in Eastern Europe as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We are working incredibly hard to help our Ukrainian employees and support our customers and partners. We have suspended all Oracle operations in Russia, and we did so well over a week ago. I'll now turn to Oracle's Q3 results. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. Clearly, we had an excellent quarter with total revenue growing over 7%. Not only was total revenue above the midpoint of my guidance, but it was also the highest organic growth rate since we began our transition to the cloud. We saw broad-based outperformance in all segments, and for the first time in more than 10 years, all segments of our business saw growth.\nTotal cloud revenues, when annualized, are now $11.2 billion, and they grew 26%. I expect that cloud revenue will exit the fiscal year growing in the mid-20s. Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 8%, and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. GAAP application subscription revenues saw record-level organic growth of 10% and were $3.2 billion. Fusion apps were up 29%, with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $5.1 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP up 35%, Fusion HCM up 22%, and NetSuite ERP up 29%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.5 billion, up 7%, and higher than last quarter. Excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 60%, and I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will trend higher over time.\nOCI consumption, which includes Autonomous Database, was up 93%, also higher than last quarter, and total Cloud at Customer revenue was up 43%, with the backlog for Cloud at Customer machines growing to triple digits. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 4%, and again, higher than last quarter. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4%, with strong performance in our tech business. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.5 billion, up over 7%, and as I mentioned earlier, our highest organic growth rate in over 10 years. Operating expenses were up 10% this quarter as we invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. The gross margins for cloud services and license support was 84%, and the gross profit dollars grew 5%. I expect the full-year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be higher than last year.\nOur plan is to continue to grow profits while we push our top-line growth into double digits next year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 46%, higher than all of our competitors. Earnings per share was adversely affected by around $0.05 per share, primarily due to share price declines of equity investments impacted by the widespread downturn in equity markets last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19%, in line with our base tax rate, and earnings per share was $1.13 in US dollars, up 1% in constant currency, and down 3% in US dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 18.4%, slightly below our base rate, and the GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 in US dollars.\nOperating cash flow for the last four quarters was $10.4 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $6.6 billion. Both results were negatively affected by a one-time litigation charge in Q2. Capital expenditures for the last four quarters were $3.8 billion, and CapEx for Q3 was $1.1 billion. We're on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year. We now have more than $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.9 billion, up 1%, with gross deferred revenue growing 6%. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $38.5 billion, up 13% in constant currency due to very strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.\nAs we've said many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 7 million shares for a total of $600 million as we reduced the buybacks in advance of the purchase of Cerner. We've paid out dividends of $3.5 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our business is strong as our fast-growing cloud business continues to become a larger proportion of the overall business. A few points. First, my guidance assumes that Cerner does not close in Q4, though it very well may close in the quarter. Again, Cerner should be accretive in the first year.\nSecondly, cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business to on-premise, and I expect that our full-year non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2022, which we're finishing now, will be 1% to 2 higher than pre-pandemic levels of 44%. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now, the US dollar strengthened dramatically in November, and as you all know, it was a lot of fluctuations this quarter. Assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 2% to 3 on revenue and $0.05 negative for EPS in Q4. Of course, the dollar could easily strengthen from here. Total revenue for Q4 is expected to grow between 6% to 8 in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5 in USD.\nCloud service and license support revenue for Q4 is expected to grow between 6% to 8 in constant currency and grow between 4% to 6 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS for Q4 is expected to be between $1.40 and $1.44 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.39 in USD. Now, both non-GAAP and GAAP EPS are expected to decline year over year due to some large investment gains we saw last year, as well as a very low tax rate last year. It was 10.7%. Both of these mask the strong earnings growth and momentum we continue to see out of our core cloud business. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%.\nAs I always say, however, one-time tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower. I expect that, in normalizing for these one-time tax events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nThank you, Safra. I have two parts to my comments. I'm going to start with, if you will, business as usual, and that is going from strength to strength in our ERP and HCM cloud businesses. I'm going to go over the wins and the go-lives for our strategic SaaS business. Second, I'm going to talk about our brand new MySQL HeatWave product. I think it's fair to say, and I'm going to read the quotes. What I'm going to do is speak a little bit about it, and then I'm going to read the quotes from analysts and customers. I think you'll find that we've never had a product so well received by customers and analysts in our history. I'm not sure the industry has either. It's a remarkable innovation, but I'm going to get to that second. First, how is our SaaS business doing right now?\nOverall, we have incredible progress, winning more and more in the ERP and HCM back office. Q3 was an exceptionally strong quarter for ERP cloud sales. We now have over 10,000 Fusion ERP HCM customers. For the first time, we're beginning to see—we've been in this business long enough—we're beginning to see us roll up certain industries, starting with the largest industry on earth, healthcare. Okay, how are we doing in healthcare? We already have Tenet Health, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Northwell Health, Mount Sinai, Atrium Health. I can go a long list of ERP and HCM wins in healthcare. Those are all healthcare providers. We've added some additional healthcare providers, mainly hospitals and clinics. We've added CHS Community Health Systems. That's a consortium of 83 hospitals, and it's an ERP, HCM, SCM win there, and we're replacing Kronos.\nI call that out because the hospitals really are—well, they're not recognized as having some similarities to Uber. They have a lot of people that work at hospitals that are not employees of the hospitals. Hospitals have a gig economy. Doctors work at multiple hospitals, multiple clinics, have their own offices. Nurses, same thing. Scheduling and paying the workforce in hospitals is one of the most complicated things ongoing in our changing economy. We have adapted our HCM systems so that we do help the hospitals recruit, track, schedule, and pay for their health professionals. The only other company that was doing that, someone not very well known, is Kronos. We're beginning to replace out Kronos in the hospital space, and we did it at the Community Health Systems. We won an HCM deal over Workday at TriHealth.\nLoma Linda University Health, we won an HCM over there, and they already have our ERP. Healthcare is interesting. I started by talking about hospitals, people who provide healthcare. The healthcare industry is much bigger than us. There are medical device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, the payers, insurance companies, and government agencies that are all part of this healthcare ecosystem. We're not just focused on providers like hospitals and clinics, but also we won a big ERP deal over SAP at Johnson & Johnson, at J&J. We won a big ERP deal over SAP at the medical device company, Haemonetics. We won an ERP deal at Saskatchewan Health Authority, one of the government payers, and most of the payers in healthcare are governments. It's this entire ecosystem that we're building specific features and functions for to automate healthcare across the board.\nNo one's been able to roll up healthcare. Everyone's tacked a little—this portion, just the providers, just the ambulatory clinics, just the inpatient hospitals, just the payers, just the pharmaceutical companies, just the medical device. We're going after the entire integrated ecosystem, and we're having some great results. Obviously, that influenced our decision to buy Cerner. We have great go-lives at Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System, that's a consortium of over 20 hospitals. We won at Integris Health. They went live on our ERP, HCM, and SCM, 16 hospitals. Nemours Children's Health went live in HCM with 34,000 users. Healthcare has been a real strength for us, and obviously, we'll get stronger with Cerner as we provide additional capability to providers. The other industry that we've always outlined as being a key strategic target of ours, in addition to healthcare, is financial services.\nWe have a very strong position in financial services: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, Bank New York Mellon, HSBC, Lloyds, Macquarie, Credit Suisse, UBS, Credit Agricole, and a lot more are our customers in ERP and HCM. We just won TD Bank, ERP win over SAP at TD Bank. We just won Silicon Valley Bank, another win over SAP. We won Societe Generale in France. We now have two of the three largest banks after winning Credit Agricole in Q2, and we will get the other one. We will get BNP Paribas very soon. JPMorgan Chase just did a huge expansion on our HCM product. Discover, the credit card, just went live on ERP. Again, very strong in financial services, getting even stronger. In communications, our big customers—AT&T, Orange, MTN, Bharti Airtel—all around the world, we just added a big ERP win at Rogers Communications.\nHuge go-live at Verizon, and that was a replacement. The go-live at Verizon was a replacement of SAP, not a win over SAP, but replacing an existing SAP system. In logistics and transportation, we had our big customers are UPS, FedEx, Knight-Swift, Yellow, Schneider National, and so on. We had a big ERP HCM win over SAP at US Xpress. We had an HCM win at TForce Freight, where we replaced Workday. Didn't beat Workday. We replaced an existing Workday system. Go-live at DHL. DHL is really interesting. It was a go-live in Germany and Austria, right in SAP's backyard. We have a number of wins in Germany. I think this is why we're pretty confident these days against the former winner in the on-premise ERP wars, SAP. In Germany, in SAP's backyard, we won DHL, we won Deutsche Post, we won Deutsche Bahn.\nWe won Dürr IT Services, and we just added a win at Daimler Truck over SAP. In Japan, a country really not known for buying package application software very much, we've got a pretty good position at Panasonic. We're at Panasonic, we're in Toyota, we're at Mizuho Financial Services. This quarter, big wins at Canon, a big ERP win over SAP at Canon, a big win at Taisei. That's one of the five largest general contractors in Japan. Doing well in Germany, doing well in Japan, doing well in these big economies where historically we have not done that well in applications, but we are now. In grocery, where we have Sainsbury's, Coop, Tesco, Auchan, Kroger, and Albertsons, we had a huge ERP expansion at Kroger and a big go-live at Albertsons with 280,000 users. Albertsons is now live on both HCM and Financials. Very strong in grocery.\nHotels and resorts, where our big logos are Marriott, Hilton, Caesars, MGM. We just won Intercontinental Hotels and Resorts, replacing—it was an HCM win—replacing—we're not allowed to name who we replaced in HCM, other than to say they're a very large cloud competitor of ours. Hilton, we went live with HCM, a big HCM expansion in the UK. Higher Ed. Higher Ed, where our big logos are UCLA, Princeton, Rutgers, Vanderbilt, Penn State, University of Texas. We added an HCM win at the University of Cambridge in the UK. We added three more campuses of the University of California system for ERP. We now have six of the nine UC campuses for ERP. Tennessee, University of Tennessee, we won ERP and HCM. The University of Arizona, big ERP win, all higher ed.\nSome of the other industries and consumer goods, we had a really important win in ERP, SCM at a division of Unilever, and that was an SAP replacement. Not a win over SAP. We replaced them. In aerospace and defense, we won ERP and SCM at BAE Systems, win over SAP. We won HCM over SAP at Tata Steel. We won a full suite expansion at Cummins. Eni, an oil and gas, which has always been a very, very strong industry for SAP, we beat them at Eni at a gas company. In the public sector, we got, well, a very important agency these days, the IOM, the UN Agency on International Organization for Migrants. This, again, was a replacement of SAP. We also won the UK Ministry of Defense. We went live with a big bang, ERP, HCM, SCM for over 50,000 user go-live.\nIn high tech, Zoom went live on ERP and SCM. Iron Mountain went live on ERP, SCM. Bed, Bath, and Beyond—that's hard to say fast—went live on ERP. Tiffany went live on an HCM expansion for 300 of their stores. In engineering and construction, Jacobs went live on ERP and SCM. In environmental services, Waste Management, big suite go-live on ERP and supply chain. I'll finish it off in professional services, where ABM went live. Okay, very, very strong quarter for us in the back office in ERP and HCM. Now, I'd like to switch from SaaS to infrastructure. We had a major announcement, and are making a major announcement about our other database. The two most popular databases in the world are Oracle and MySQL. MySQL is the world's most popular open-source database.\nMySQL is very good at transaction processing, but historically has not been good at query processing. MySQL customers usually use the MySQL database for transaction processing, and then they'll move their data from the MySQL database into Redshift at Amazon or into Snowflake to do the query processing. That's how it's typically used: MySQL for transaction processing, Redshift, Snowflake for query processing. By the way, AWS has their own version of MySQL. They call it Aurora. The AWS MySQL, Redshift, MySQL Aurora, Redshift business is a multi-billion dollar business. Now, we're going after that business in two ways. We built a product, MySQL HeatWave, which is different than earlier versions of MySQL. MySQL HeatWave is good at both transaction processing and query processing. MySQL HeatWave doesn't simply replace Aurora.\nIt replaces both Aurora and Redshift, or it replaces both Aurora and Snowflake, because MySQL HeatWave does transaction processing very well, replacing Aurora, and it does query processing a lot better than Redshift or Snowflake. Because HeatWave runs, and we decided for the first time to make this a multi-cloud product. Oracle HeatWave runs already in the Oracle Cloud, but we also have it up and running in AWS, and Azure users will be able to use it as well. It is a multi-cloud product. AWS users, why did we do that? We did that because we're going after the Aurora user base, and the Redshift and Snowflake user base. We want to make it really easy to convert from Aurora and Redshift or Aurora and Snowflake to Oracle HeatWave.\nIf we're running on AWS, for example, you press a button, a couple of buttons, and your data is moved immediately to Oracle MySQL HeatWave. You do not have to change your application at all. You press a couple of buttons, and you move it. Okay, why would you do that? Well, because the cost performance benefits of moving to MySQL HeatWave are extraordinary. Now, I'm going to stop talking, and I'm going to start reading, and I'm going to start reading analyst quotes, and I'm going to read them word for word. When I say the benefits are extraordinary, I'm understanding what they're saying. Let me bring up these slides. I'm going to just start reading a few quotes.\nOkay, one industry analyst, combined with HeatWave and Autopilot, combined with HeatWave and Autopilot, MySQL database service may very well be the single greatest innovation in open-source cloud databases in the past 20 years. MySQL HeatWave and Autopilot represent a quantum leap, with top-flight query performance and superb transaction support. Oracle wants to open up a second front in the battle for the database market leadership. They're attracting an entirely different user base with this product. Wikibon believes that the technology underlying MySQL HeatWave is an inflection point in database design and architecture. The MySQL HeatWave technology is by far the best in the market. Oracle has shown AWS and Snowflake how to design and architect a true MySQL cloud database. Customers can expect MySQL HeatWave to outperform about seven times faster than Amazon Redshift or Snowflake at 2 to 5 times lower cost.\nThe benefits against Amazon Aurora are even greater. New entrants such as Snowflake will need to improve their cloud technology fast to stay competitive with HeatWave. This is all word for word what analysts are saying. These are the most distinguished database analysts in the business. The bottom line is we believe the competition just got outplayed in every measurable metric imaginable. This represents a wake-up call for the industry, and a rude awakening to the database cloud competition as they all must respond now to the MySQL innovation juggernaut. HeatWave is the physical manifestation of nearly 10 years of deep database engineering techniques, over five dozen patents, and demonstrates what real cloud database innovation looks like in 2021. Oracle introduced MySQL HeatWave, and they did send shockwaves because they named and shamed basically every database company out there. My favorite is what they talked about with Snowflake.\nYou can spend $80,000 on HeatWave, and that would cost you $420,000 to run on Snowflake. It's a no-brainer. These new fully transparent benchmarks, by the way, we put all of our benchmarks on GitHub. It's all public. The code, the data, the customers can reproduce all of these benchmarks that the analysts are talking about. That's what the analyst did. The analyst went out and ran their own benchmarks, and they were shocked. These new fully transparent benchmarks demonstrate HeatWave's performance, price, and scale advantages over all other MySQL and cloud databases. Clearly, the cloud data warehouse market wasn't ready for this, and now the competition needs to scramble as they grapple for answers. For organizations using MySQL, Oracle has given them yet another reason to invest in its HeatWave offering by delivering seven times the performance at one-fifth the cost of solutions such as Snowflake.\nTogether with massive scale-out capabilities, this combination makes MySQL HeatWave melt down Snowflake and vaporize. It sounds like I wrote it, but I didn't. We'll provide you with all of these quotes, all in full context, names, quotes. These are all analyst quotes. Taken together with massive scale-out capabilities, this combination makes MySQL HeatWave melt down Snowflake and vaporize Amazon Redshift with Aqua. MySQL HeatWave's TPCH analytics testing literally blows away Amazon's Redshift with Aqua in both performance and cost performance. It's 6.8 times faster and 47% less expensive. Amazon Redshift with Aqua is 18 times slower, resulting in MySQL HeatWave coming in at an extraordinary 17 times better, 17x better cost performance. MySQL HeatWave with Autopilot sets the bar orders of magnitude higher than AWS, Azure, Google, and Snowflake. I think I'll stop right there and turn it back to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThank you, Larry.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nHolly, if you could please prepare the audience for a Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, press star then 1 on your telephone keypad. Our first question for the day will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director and Senior US Software Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much, and congrats on the continued momentum, and especially all those great customer wins, Larry. I have one quick one for Safra and then a follow-up for you. Safra, just looking at my model, it looks like you had your strongest organic revenue growth in 10 years this quarter, and I just want to make sure I've got that right and I'm not missing anything.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nYeah, you've got that right.\nIt's basically because of what I've been telling you all for a while, which is our fastest growing business, which is our cloud, is now getting to be very big. When you're growing different parts of the business 25%, 30%, 40%, 60%, and it's a big number, it's just math here. It increases the overall rate of growth of the business.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director and Senior US Software Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, Safra. Larry, you now have an increasing number of ISVs that are now supporting and embedding OCI, as well as targeted programs where you have some of the largest global SIs in the world really leaning in. Can you talk to us about how you're winning the ecosystem with OCI?\nIf you can update us on the mix of traditional versus non-traditional Oracle workloads, just to help us get a sense of how the use cases are evolving and where you see that mix going. Thanks.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nWell, I think it's a broad base. I think one of the back office, one of our partners, we're working with one of the largest banks on the planet on a payment system, a B2B payment system, because the ERP customers are coming to Oracle. If you look at the future with the fact that we're so strong, dominant, I'd argue, in cloud ERP, what does a B2B purchase look like? A B2B purchase looks like in a modern cloud world, one Oracle ERP system making a purchase from another Oracle ERP system. We want to automate that B2B transaction.\nare two Oracle ERP systems that are talking to one another. To automate that transaction, we have to be able to pay for that. We have to be able to check credit, finance the payments, arrange the logistics. We are working with a very large bank and a very large logistics company to automate that aspect of our ERP business. It is something that has never been automated. You do not think of ERP doing that, but it is this network of these ERP systems talking to one another. That is a huge business revenue opportunity to turn on that B2B payment system. The banks are joining in, logistics companies are joining in because the customers are here. Once the ERP customers started coming to Oracle, all of the adjacent applications, and all of the ISVs with adjacent applications, wanted to be in the same cloud as the ERP customers.\nThe integrators had to become familiar with the cloud because that's where the customers are, and that's where new customers are going. The ISVs, and these are kind of interesting ISVs, giant banks, giant logistics companies putting up their logistics and payment systems in our cloud to facilitate B2B transactions between our ERP systems, is just a gigantic business opportunity that no one really had ever thought about before. It's really helpful.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director and Senior US Software Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks so much, Larry. Congrats again.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Capital\n\nThank you. I'm trying my luck here, Safra, but any comments on the TikTok rumors that came out today? In case you don't want to answer that, Larry, one for you on that success in the back office systems.\nIs that driven by post-pandemic people realizing, oh, shoot, I really need to update that? Is that kind of more a temporary boom that you're seeing here, or do you think there's more lags to that? Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nThe one thing I can tell you is we have an excellent relationship with the folks at TikTok.\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nYeah, I'll second that. It's excellent. Let me take the other part of your question, which is, do I think this is kind of a year 2000-like pandemic boom, people rushing to get to the cloud, and it's going to slow down after now that the pandemic, thank God, is beginning to recede? Just the opposite. We're really still in the early days. We're in the early days of either understanding how different cloud ERP is from on-premise ERP.\nI just mentioned this one interesting example in that in the modern world, as more and more people go to cloud ERP and you procure something, that it's really one Oracle ERP system talking to another Oracle ERP system, but it needs to be facilitated with a finance partner and probably multiple finance partners and multiple logistics partners. To automate and finance and move that product from A to B and finance that product and understand when it's going to be delivered, all of those things. No, I think we're really in the early days, even though we now have 10,000 customers in Oracle ERP Fusion and another almost 30,000 customers in total, including NetSuite. I still think we're in the very early days of doing this. It's just getting faster. I mean, our growth is accelerating, accelerating, accelerating.\nYou look at our growth rate, it's not going down. We're getting bigger, and the growth rate, and we're sustaining that mid-30s, high 20s, mid-30s growth rate with NetSuite and Fusion, in spite of the fact we've more than doubled.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Capital\n\nPerfect. Congrats. Yeah, it sounds really exciting. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\n\nPhil Winslow\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nHey, thank you for taking my question. Congrats on another quarter of accelerating growth. One comment from your script today really stood out to me, and that was, continue to grow profits while we push our top-line growth into the double digits next year. Now, obviously, this is continued re-acceleration from the 6% to 8 the past two quarters, and your guidance, obviously, on a consequency basis for Q4.\nMy question to you, Safra and Larry, is, could you help just unpack this for us in terms of the puts and takes between database and apps, cloud on-premise, etc., that give you confidence for continued acceleration in the double digits, but also, like you said, while growing profits?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nOkay. As you've seen, we've made a lot of investments. Our CapEx this year is double last year, and that's because we've been putting out a lot of capability around the world. Simultaneously, our revenues have been increasing, but over the past few years, we've had parts of the business that were significant parts of the business that were shrinking. Now, as you see in this quarter, for example, all lines of businesses are increasing. We have different lines of business have bookings growth, some of which are as high as, well, over 100%.\nWhat's happened is most of the business is now growing, and so there are much less of the negatives. The things that were getting smaller, like application license, for example, is a very small number now. Of course, our technology license is going very, very well, including just this quarter, technology was up 9%. The cloud business is on an absolute roll. You can see it in the numbers already, and ERP, HCM, but also, of course, OCI straight and Autonomous Database, and just all those parts of the business are now growing, and they're large. The shrinking parts of the business, first of all, there's a lot less shrinking. We grew, and to the extent that we have some supply chain loosening where we are able to deliver all of our bookings, we just expect growth sort of all over the place.\nWe're very upbeat about this next year.\n\nPhil Winslow\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is going to come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a great quarter. It's great to see the momentum really showing through to the results now. Last quarter, you guys talked a lot about an increasing focus on verticals, particularly banking and healthcare. This quarter, you're talking about rolling up some of those verticals. Can you talk to us a little bit more about the approach on how you build up and create that roll-up in the vertical? How much of that effort is building vertical-specific product? How much of it is a new go-to-market strategy, if you will, or aligning the go-to-market strategy for those verticals?\nHow much work is left to be done on those two sides?\n\nLarry Ellison\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer, Oracle\n\nWell, let me just start with healthcare because you think of healthcare as a vertical, and Cerner is certainly in a vertical, which is an epic they compete for providers. People think of that as, well, that's healthcare. But that's not healthcare. There are clinical trials in pharmaceutical companies. You want to integrate the clinical trials the pharmaceutical companies pay for and run, but actually, not really. The providers run those clinical trials. The whole ecosystem, no one's ever tried to do the entire ecosystem. To answer your question, we are greatly enhancing our HCM system for hospitals so that they can have nurses that work three days a week or four days a week, and doctors that work in a couple of different hospitals.\nScheduling these independent contractors, if you will, is very complicated. You don't think of hospitals as being a collection of independent contractors, but it's full-time workers and independent contractors, and scheduling that's complex. Paying them is complex. Some of them are unionized. The rules are complex. We're doing a massive—massive. We're doing a lot of industry-specific features for hospitals to help them manage their workforce. Inventory, hospital inventory isn't in a warehouse. Hospital inventory, the drugs, they're scattered all throughout the hospital. Nurses' stations have drugs. There's an interesting drug called tranexamic acid, which is used to stop bleeding. Well, you can't go to the warehouse. If someone's bleeding, you can't go to the warehouse and look for the drug. You got to be able to find it immediately, and it's got to be close to the operating room.\nIt's got to be close to where the intensive care unit is. The inventory is distributed all throughout the hospital. We are putting RFID tags on all the inventory so you can find things very, very quickly. How we handle inventory is being enhanced specifically for hospitals. I can go on and on. One thing a doctor does is, before I can authorize a test, before I can authorize prescribing a drug for a patient, I have to check with the insurance company to make sure they'll pay for it. The doctors and hospitals spend a lot of time negotiating with the payer, the insurance company. Well, given these symptoms, can I get this test paid for? Yes, no. Given these symptoms, can I get this drug paid for? Yes, no. We're automating that interaction between the payers and the providers.\nYes, we're adding a lot of industry-specific features to automate the interactions in the entire ecosystem. That's why we think we're in a good position to roll up healthcare, which is a gigantic industry. No one's ever really tried this before, but we have all the pieces. We have the payment pieces, we automate a lot of the insurers, we have HCM, which allows us to help them manage their workforce, we have ERP, which helps them keep track of inventory, and soon we will have Cerner, which will help them to deliver care to patients. We'll be in every—and we have a clinical trial system for the pharmaceutical companies. We have the entire portfolio, and we're interconnecting all the pieces so we can make that ecosystem work efficiently for the first time.\nActually, the pandemic has showed we're in desperate need of such an integrated system. Yeah, it sounds like a massive value unlock if it gets all pulled together. I think we can do it. We're on our way to do it. The benefits to Oracle are great, but actually, this is a—at least for me personally, this is a mission. I think the benefits to every patient in the world is going to be enormous. We need to do this. The pandemic has shown a variety of weaknesses in our healthcare systems. We have the technology to address those weaknesses, and that's what we're going to do.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOutstanding. Thank you for super helpful.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nLet me just say one other thing. We have a number of vertical industries in which we have products, and our competitors don't have products.\nThis has been a core part of how we work. We work with retailers, we work in financial services, we work in utilities, we work in construction engineering. We don't just modify ERP systems slightly and say we're in the industry. We're actually in operational systems in the industry, and it brings incredible value to our customers to be able to use these products.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nRight. Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nExcuse me, our last question for the day will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks very much. Safra, I was hoping you could expand a bit on the strengthened Cloud at Customer and just really two things about that. How should we think about Cloud at Customer being somewhat of a leading indicator for adoption of Autonomous Database?\nAre any of the supply constraints starting to loosen up a bit on that front in terms of maybe helping to accelerate RevRec in that area over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nCEO, Oracle\n\nWell, I will admit that the past couple of years have been really challenging, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. I think our excellent relationships with our wonderful suppliers made it possible for us to build out our cloud as well as provide hardware to our customers. We couldn't meet every need as quickly as we would have liked, and we have an extremely large backlog. That is absolutely true. That backlog also gives me enormous visibility because those customers have told us they want cloud at customer or they want hardware, and I have a line of sight to get it landed in their facilities.\nThe reality is that we have so much going on at the same time. We've built out our cloud internationally. We've built a number of private clouds where it is exactly the same capability as our public cloud for our customers who have regulatory requirements that require something special, whether it's data sovereignty or otherwise. We're meeting everyone's needs. I think that, again, the incredible optimism you hear from me and Larry is very much because we have line of sight to the massive demand that has been coming our way and that we've been handling, and a line of sight on how to deliver it. I read the newspapers. Actually, I don't read a newspaper. I read the computer that used to be a newspaper. We see everything that's going on, but I'm extremely confident in the capabilities of my team to execute.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. That will conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn it over to management for their closing comments.\n\nKen Bond\n\nSVP, Oracle\n\nThank you, Holly. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our investor relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn it back to Holly to close the call.\n\nOperator\n\nOnce again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's Oracle Third Quarter 2022 conference call. You may now disconnect."

Q3 2025 earnings conference call. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Quast\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Kroger Co\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Q3 2025 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ron Sargent, and Chief Financial Officer, David Kennerley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary.\nI will now turn the call over to Ron.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call today. We're happy to deliver another quarter of strong results reflecting meaningful progress on our strategic priorities. This quarter, we continue to focus on what matters most: serving our customers, running great stores, and strengthening our core business. These efforts are improving the customer experience and creating a strong foundation for long-term growth. Today, we're going to talk about the things we got done this quarter, the proof points of our progress, and the ways we're positioning Kroger for continued success. I'd like to start with sharing the results of our e-commerce strategic review. It marks an important step in how we're evolving our business to meet customer needs and also to improve profitability.\nIn today's world, having a strong e-commerce offering is key to delivering a differentiated customer experience and also represents an important growth driver for our business. We've made good progress, building a more than $14 billion business and achieving six consecutive quarters of double-digit sales growth. Earlier this year, we formed our new e-commerce team, headed by Yael Cosset, designed to align all of the teams who contribute to the online customer experience. By bringing these teams together, we've created a more integrated structure to support our strategy. Building on that foundation, we conducted a comprehensive review of our entire e-commerce model. This review helped us to identify where we can be more efficient and better meet customer demand. Customers increasingly value speed, flexibility, and convenience, and better leveraging store-based fulfillment helps us meet those expectations.\nAs a result, we're evolving our hybrid fulfillment model by using automated fulfillment in geographies where customer demand supports it and also leveraging store-based fulfillment through our pickup business and relationships with well-established third-party delivery partners. These changes are fully consistent with our broader organizational goals to improve operational efficiency, to drive profitability, and to more effectively utilize our stores. We will make these changes to our network through a phased approach, ensuring we maintain flexibility to adjust our plans while minimizing operational and customer disruption. In recognition of this shift, we announced the closure of three automated fulfillment centers that haven't met operational and financial expectations. We expect these fulfillment centers to close by the end of January 2026.\nBased on our customer and store-level analysis, in those geographies where we will close sites but continue to operate stores, we expect to retain most of our customers and their e-commerce spend through store-based fulfillment and in-store shopping. We expect these closures to have a neutral impact on identical sales without fuel. With more fulfillment occurring in stores, we recently expanded our relationships with third-party delivery providers Instacart, DoorDash, and Uber Eats. By using our store network, we're improving both geographic coverage and speed with delivery in as little as 30 minutes. Each of our delivery partners brings unique strengths and specific benefits to our customers. They will also create new opportunities for our media business, both on our platform and on theirs, something David will cover later. So, in summary, this refreshed hybrid model helps us to attract new customers, improve delivery speeds, and leverages our growing store network.\nWe expect these decisions to contribute approximately $400 million in e-commerce profitability improvements in 2026, making our e-commerce business profitable in 2026. Turning now to store operations. Running great stores and delivering an exceptional customer experience are central to our strategy. Our internal composite scores, which measure key metrics such as in-stocks, fresh quality, and customer service, continue to show steady improvement. We're also investing in experiences that matter most to our customers, including adding store hours to improve checkout speed, increase service, and improve in-stocks. These investments are delivering tangible results, including significant year-over-year reductions in wait times for our customers. To support these changes, we're utilizing an AI-powered workforce management platform, which enables better coverage during peak periods and gives associates greater flexibility.\nThis tool combines real-time labor insights with intelligent scheduling, allowing store leaders to proactively fill open shifts and ensure the right staffing at the right time, especially during high-demand periods like weekends and holidays. Finally, as part of our commitment to simplifying our business, we are making good progress in reviewing all non-core assets to determine their ongoing contribution and role within the company. All of these actions strengthen our business and position Kroger for long-term growth. Before I talk about the results, I want to take a moment to just share what we're seeing from customers and how that's shaping our approach going forward. Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to influence customer behavior, and we're seeing a split across income groups. Spending from higher-income households continues strong, while middle-income customers are feeling increased pressure, similar to what we've seen from lower-income households over the past several quarters.\nThey're making smaller, more frequent trips to manage budgets, and they are cutting back on discretionary purchases. Food spend has been more resilient than non-food spend. Categories like natural and organics continue to perform well, reflecting continued interest in healthy and premium options. At the same time, customers are turning to promotions and Our Brands as smart ways to save without sacrificing quality. Ready-to-eat and other meal solutions are providing another way for households to get quality and convenience at a great value. Inflation and uncertainty around government funding, combined with the pause in SNAP benefits during the final weeks of the quarter, added incremental pressure to our Q3 Identical Sales without fuel. These trends reinforce the importance of delivering value through lower prices, affordable quality in Our Brands' products, and more promotions for customers to save.\nTurning to our Q3 results, identical sales without fuel grew 2.6% year-over-year and accelerated on a two-year stack basis up 4.9%. Sales growth was led by pharmacy and e-commerce. Gaining market share continues to be a top priority. In a challenging macroeconomic environment, we delivered share trend improvement again this quarter after adjusting for closed stores, reflecting the progress we're making in strengthening our competitive position. We also increased our price investments this quarter. Toward the end of the quarter, when SNAP benefits were held up, we increased promotions to help customers save. We are disciplined in those investments, balancing our gross margin rate to ensure we deliver value in a sustainable way. Our Brands had another strong quarter with sales outpacing national brands. Customers continue to choose these products because they deliver high quality at a great value.\nOur premium lines, Simple Truth and Private Selection, were the strongest performers again this quarter. Our Brands' products carry a more favorable margin profile and also improve profitability during the quarter. These results highlight the strategic importance of Our Brands: driving sales, building loyalty, and improving profitability. E-commerce sales were strong again this quarter, growing 17%, led by delivery. We also improved e-com profitability with both pickup and delivery showing strong quarter-over-quarter improvement. We're encouraged by the early results from our DoorDash relationship. In its first month alone, we fulfilled 1 million orders, bringing new customers and incremental meal occasions to Kroger. As we evolve our hybrid model, we expect to continue to ramp up both sales and profitability. This quarter's results show the progress we're making. We also know we have more to do. Looking toward the future, as we've shared previously, we're accelerating expansion of our store footprint.\nWe expect to break ground on 14 new stores in the Q4, marking a meaningful acceleration in activity. Earlier this quarter, we announced expansion plans for Harris Teeter, one of our strongest and most successful banners. These plans include opening additional new stores in the Southeast and entering Jacksonville, Florida, which is an important adjacent geography that positions us to grow households and gain share. Looking ahead, we plan to accelerate capital investment in new stores beyond 2025 to strengthen our competitive position, expand into high-potential geographies, and support long-term growth. As we expand our footprint, our approach to site selection and store format starts with the customer, then prioritizes improving ROIC with a focus on delivering greater shareholder value. We also see significant opportunity to continue taking cost out of our business, starting with procurement.\nBoth cost of goods sold and goods not for resale are areas with significant potential for savings, and we are acting to capture those benefits. At the same time, we are rethinking how we work. This includes leveraging technology and artificial intelligence to simplify tasks and operate more efficiently, putting talent closer to the customer and building a more streamlined organization. As part of this effort, we are returning to in-office work five days a week to strengthen collaboration, accelerate decision-making, and better support our stores. Working together also creates a better environment for our associates to learn and develop. These changes will allow us to move faster and lead to a more efficient organization. We're also looking to emerging technologies such as agentic AI to enhance the customer experience.\nWe plan to introduce new agentic shopping capabilities, starting with Instacart's AI-powered chat assistant on the Kroger website and mobile app in the Q4 of 2026. The chat assistant will help customers shop more effortlessly by making it easier to build personalized baskets, find meal ideas, and save time. We'll embrace this technology while making sure it complements what differentiates Kroger today: fresh products, unique Our Brands products, and an industry-leading loyalty program. While the landscape continues to evolve, we're confident we'll be able to use technology to improve the customer experience. Finally, we're continuing the foundational work toward refreshing our go-to-market strategy with the customer of the future in mind. This includes a deep dive into customer data and a rigorous assessment of our competitive positioning. This work is shaping the foundation for our next phase of growth.\nNow I'll turn it over to David, who will review our financial results in more detail. David?\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Kroger delivered another strong set of results this quarter, driven by solid execution in our core grocery business and continued growth in e-commerce and pharmacy. In a challenging environment marked with cautious consumer spending, the government shutdown, and a pause in SNAP distributions, we improved market share trends, excluding the impact of store closures, by delivering meaningful value for customers. We delivered these results while continuing to balance the right investments for the customer with disciplined margin management. I'll now walk through our financial results for the Q4.\nWe achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 2.6%, moderating slightly from last quarter as we cycled the impact of last year's Hurricane Helene and port strike, as well as the pause in SNAP distributions during our final week of the quarter. On a two-year stack basis, identical sales without fuel accelerated by 20 basis points to 4.9%, reflecting continued strength in our business. Our identical sales without fuel growth was again led by strong pharmacy and e-commerce results. Food inflation increased moderately compared to the prior quarter, with notable inflation in certain commodities, particularly beef. Our pharmacy business delivered another strong quarter, fueled by growth in both core pharmacy scripts and GLP-1s. While the strong growth in pharmacy sales impacts our margin rate, it contributes positive gross profit dollar growth and supports our overall operating profit.\nOur FIFO gross margin rates, excluding rent, depreciation, and amortization, and fuel, increased 49 basis points in Q4 compared to the same period last year. The improvement in rates was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Our Brands' performance, lower supply chain costs, and lower shrink, partially offset by the mix effect from growth in pharmacy sales, which has lower margins, and price investments. After excluding the effect from the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, our FIFO gross margin rate increased 24 basis points. As we communicated last quarter, we expect our gross margin rate for the full year on an underlying basis to be relatively flat as we balance the impact of pharmacy mix, margin enhancement initiatives, and price investments. The operating, general, and administrative rates, excluding fuel, and adjustment items, increased 27 basis points in Q4 compared to the same period last year.\nThe increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and investments in associate wages and benefits, partially offset by lower incentive plan costs and improved productivity. After adjusting for the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, our adjusted OG&A rate increased 9 basis points on an underlying basis. As we did in the Q1 this year, we took the opportunity to make an accelerated pension contribution in Q3, which was worth 8 basis points on our OG&A rate. This reflects a proactive approach to reducing future liabilities and, most importantly, helps secure long-term benefits for our associates. Our LIFO charge for the quarter was $44 million, compared to a LIFO charge of $4 million last year, resulting in a 4% headwind to EPS this quarter.\nOur adjusted FIFO operating profit in the quarter was $1.1 billion, and adjusted EPS was $1.05, both reflecting 7% growth compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of Kroger's strategy and builds loyalty with customers through our Kroger Plus Fuel Rewards program. Fuel sales were lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to fewer gallons sold. Fuel profitability was in line with expectations, just slightly ahead of the same period last year. We expect gallons sold to remain lower on a year-over-year basis for the Q4. Turning now to e-commerce. Our e-commerce business delivered 17% growth this quarter, driven by an increase in both households and order frequency. Orders delivered within two hours or less grew by more than 30%, reflecting the growing immediacy demand.\nBuilding on what Ron shared earlier, the recent update to our e-commerce strategy reflects a thoughtful evolution of how we serve our customers and drive sustainable growth. Our refreshed hybrid fulfillment model allows us to leverage the strength of both automation and store-based fulfillment to meet evolving customer expectations. This also allows us to optimize the performance and use of automated fulfillment centers when the right conditions exist, and utilize third-party partners for faster delivery while reaching new customers and incremental trips. Our new model positions us for both strong sustainable growth and improved flexibility. From a financial perspective, we're significantly accelerating the profitability of our e-commerce business. Closing three fulfillment centers and increasing store-based delivery will deliver approximately $400 million in incremental e-commerce operating profit in 2026. As a result, we now expect our e-commerce business to be profitable in 2026.\nThe benefits from these decisions will be primarily used to reinvest in our business to increase value for customers and improve the shopping experience as we look to accelerate sales. We also remain focused on expanding operating margins, and a portion of these benefits will be used to increase shareholder value. Given the financial performance of our automated fulfillment network and the closure of specific sites, and as previously announced, we recorded an impairment and related charges of $2.6 billion in the Q4. We will continue to monitor our retained sites with a focus on improving operating efficiency and strengthening financial performance. Our updated hybrid model also creates new opportunities for our media business. Our broad reach and unmatched food retail capabilities are attractive to delivery partners, and we've structured these relationships to benefit our media business.\nFor example, our unique approach to collaboration with Instacart, DoorDash, and Uber unlocks new media opportunities across both platforms, and we're already seeing strong interest from several large CPG brands. By integrating our customer data and loyalty insights with third-party platforms, we can bring more targeted and innovative media campaigns to reach new customer segments and create additional monetization opportunities. Our media business had a strong quarter with double-digit growth and continues to be a meaningful contributor to profitability. We're encouraged by the momentum and believe we have an opportunity to accelerate growth even further as we leverage new capabilities and improve coordination between our media and merchandising teams. I'd now like to turn to capital allocation and financial strategy. Kroger delivered strong adjusted free cash flow this quarter, which reflects the strength of our operating performance.\nFree cash flow is important to our model, providing liquidity for our operations and strengthening our balance sheet. At quarter end, our net total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.73, which is below our target ratio range of 2.3 to 2.5. This provides us with financial flexibility to pursue growth investments and other opportunities to enhance shareholder value. We expect to return to our target leverage ratio over time and will share more details about our plans for 2026 next quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent and are designed to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We are focused on investing in projects that will maximize return on invested capital over time while remaining committed to maintaining our current investment grade rating, growing our dividend subject to Board approval, and returning excess capital to shareholders.\nDuring the Q4, we completed our $5 billion ASR program under Kroger's $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization. We are currently executing open market repurchases and expect to complete the remaining $2.5 billion under the authorization by the end of the fiscal year, which is contemplated in full year guidance. Improving ROIC is a key priority. As we shared earlier, we expect our updated hybrid e-commerce model and investments in new stores to drive stronger returns going forward. Building on that, we continue to sharpen our focus on cost structure. We've made meaningful progress so far, but we see greater opportunities ahead by modernizing operations and ways of working across our organization, from stores to support centers. We also see opportunities to improve procurement to unlock additional cost savings. The combination of disciplined cost management and capital deployment positions Kroger to deliver stronger returns and create more shareholder value.\nI would now like to provide some additional detail on our outlook for the rest of the year. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our business, supported by strong performances in pharmacy and e-commerce. Given our year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our range for identical sales without fuel growth to a new range of 2.8% to 3% and raising the lower end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a new range of $4.75 to 4.80. This includes the impact of LIFO, which is now expected to be a 7% headwind compared to what we expected at the start of the year. As we move into Q4, we expect a slight improvement in our OG&A rate to help mitigate the impact of a slight decline in FIFO gross margin rate.\nOne additional factor to note is the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on our pharmacy business. Beginning on January 1, this legislation is expected to reduce Medicare drug prices on 10 highly utilized medications. Sales on these medications will be recorded at the new reduced prices. Kroger will continue purchasing these drugs at current acquisition costs, and manufacturers will fully reimburse Kroger for the difference through rebates, which will then be recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold. As a result, we expect that this will lower Q4 identical sales without fuel by approximately 30 to 40 basis points, but will have no impact on our earnings. This is reflected in our updated guidance. I will now turn the call back to Ron.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nThank you, David. In closing, we're encouraged by the progress we're making. Our priorities are clear, and we're executing with greater speed and discipline.\nWe're strengthening our core business and investing in areas that will contribute to long-term growth. We're taking decisive actions today that will make Kroger stronger now and in the future and deliver greater value for our shareholders over time. Before we move into Q&A, I want to provide a brief update on the CEO search. Our Board remains actively engaged and is making good progress. While we don't have a specific timeline to announce today, we're engaged in a thorough process and expect to appoint a new CEO during Q1 2026. We'll now open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to remove your question, please press star followed by two. The first question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. John, please go ahead.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nHey, good morning, John.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nHey, Ron. Can you talk about the accelerated store program, right? Maybe talk about that cadence. And then when you think about, you've got obviously a fairly far-flung network. How do you think about concentrating that? And as part of this, I know the digital review is different. When you think about the portfolio that you currently have, are there opportunities? Are you looking to do you exit some places? Do you double down in others as part of the store effort?\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nSure. Let me kind of try to answer several of those questions. First of all, we're pretty excited about kind of the new investments in store because that drives a lot of goodness from the top line and the same store sales line. And we think we've got a great long runway to grow stores.\nI think when you think about the things that go into making stores successful, obviously the right location, the right market, you've got to have great operational infrastructure as well as talent. And obviously, you're not going to open a store unless you think it's going to deliver a terrific return. In the fourth quarter, we plan to complete about four major store projects. We're going to break ground on another 14 stores. And when you look at 2026, we expect to increase new store builds by 30%. In terms of—and I guess the other thing I should just mention is how excited we are about our entry into Jacksonville with Harris Teeter. Harris Teeter runs a great business. They already operate in Florida in Amelia Island, which is about 40mi from Jacksonville. Florida itself is a large state.\nIt's a growing state. We expect to do very well there. I think Jacksonville is the 10th largest city in the United States, and I think it's the largest city in Florida. I think that's kind of an indication of we're going to continue to expand in adjacent markets. I think we also have opportunities to grow through acquisition, and we haven't ruled that out despite our last few years with Albertsons. I think when you look at our long-term aspiration, we expect and plan to be a national retailer. I'm not sure that answers all your questions. Concentration is important. We'll certainly fill up Jacksonville before we move to adjacent markets. But we think we've got great opportunities to grow stores.\nI think, frankly, that's been one of our biggest challenges over the last few years: we haven't allocated enough capital to growing stores because we have allocated a lot of capital in other areas, like fulfillment centers.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nGreat. And maybe just a follow-up, totally unrelated. The CEO search has been one of the longest, right? I think we've seen in a while. I'm curious, you and the Board, what are you looking for? Maybe characteristic-wise, capability-wise, and what does the business need from that person?\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nSure. Yeah. I think, as you know, we've been pretty deliberate in the process. We've also been very thorough in the process. We're working with an executive search firm, and we have identified and engaged with really several very highly qualified candidates. I think we have announced publicly that our next CEO will be external.\nI think we expect them to bring in fresh perspectives to the organization and also to complement the culture that we have today, which is pretty strong at Kroger as well. In terms of what we're looking for, we want a deep understanding of retail transformation. We want somebody who's very close to the customer. We want somebody who has demonstrated success operating at scale, who knows how to operate. And frankly, cultural fit and alignment with Kroger values is critical as well. And like I said, we're getting closer. We're making good progress, and we expect that decision will be announced in Q1.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Ed, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nMorning, Ed.\n\nEd Kelly\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question.\nI wanted to maybe first, Ron, could you just kind of step back and maybe talk about how you're feeling about the current grocery ID trend? It seems like you want that to be better. The competitive environment seems like it may be ticking up a bit. And you did mention some investment in price towards the end of the quarter. How should we think about all of that in the context of maintaining underlying gross margin stability going forward? And I think what you are implying for next year, based upon the way you're talking about e-com, is at least maybe some EBIT margin expansion.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nSure. Yeah. Let me just talk a little bit about sales. I think this morning we announced that sales came in a little lighter than we expected, and that was primarily later in the quarter. And that's due to a combination of factors.\nWe saw increased caution and uncertainty among consumers, particularly in October and November, due to the concerns about the government shutdown. Also, the pause in SNAP benefit distributions created some headwinds at the end of the quarter. I think consumers are becoming more selective. They're buying more on promotion. They're reducing the discretionary purchases. Things like general merchandise comped negative during the quarter. Also, we had a tougher ID comparison in Q3 from the prior year. Despite all that, our two-year stacked identical sales were up 20 basis points, and I think that might have been one of the higher quarters of the year. But I think what we're doing going forward is our focus remains on value and serving customers during a pretty uncertain time. If you look at Q4, well, Q4 to date, we're feeling pretty good about our quarter-to-date sales.\nWe're slightly ahead of our guidance that we provided this morning. But we don't anticipate any meaningful improvement in the consumer environment in Q4. Also, when you do the math, looking at the top line, we're also going to lap harder comparisons in Q4. Last year, we benefited from some weather, and maybe we'll have weather again this year. Also, we benefited from egg inflation last year that we won't see this year. And then finally, and I think David mentioned this one, is we'll see some headwinds relating to the Inflation Reduction Act in pharmacy, and that will hit us in January to the tune of about 30 basis points in overall ID sales. You ask about competition. Yeah. I think the environment remains very competitive, as it always is in the retail world. I think especially true today when consumers are looking for great value.\nFrankly, our focus is just running the Kroger playbook. We want to run great stores. We want to drive e-commerce business. We want to grow alternative profits. We continue to lower prices. We took down another 1,000 items in Q3. I think we will continue to ramp up promotions during the holidays to drive traffic as well as basket sizes. The good news is that vendor funding continues to be strong to support our initiatives. Maybe I'll give you one example of that, of the Thanksgiving meal bundle that we announced a few weeks ago. We lowered the price this year over last year, and we did not cut the menu to do so. I think the bundle fed 10 people for less than $5 per person. In answer to your question, yeah, the environment remains competitive, and we expect that to continue.\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nHey, just a couple of things to build on Ron's comments. I think also important to note that in the quarter, our share trends improved. So despite the impact on sales from the things that Ron talked about, we saw sequential improvement in our share trends, which was good. And then in terms of gross margin, I think Q3 shows that we manage gross margin in a very, very responsible way. And I think despite what we've guided to for Q4, you guys should think about us continuing to do that in a responsible way. If you look at actually the breakdown of gross margin, selling gross itself actually declined as we invested in pricing, but we were able to offset that with mix on Our Brands, good sourcing improvements, shrink, and other supply chain costs.\nI think I'd expect a similar dynamic to what we saw in Q3 going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nMorning, Michael.\n\nMichael Montani\n\nResearch Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYes. Hi. Morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess one thing that I was going to ask about was when you look at the pharmacy drug pricing headwind, should we anticipate that that annualizes closer to 100 bps for next year? That was part one. And then part two is just, can you parse out some of the tailwinds you might have to offset when you think about Express Scripts' impact? Where's that now? How does that mature? DoorDash and Uber Eats, just trying to see what there might be there as offsets.\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nHey, thanks for the questions. David here. So obviously, we're not getting into 2026 guidance today.\nWe'll obviously get into more details on that in our next quarterly earnings. Let me just add a little bit more color on the Inflation Reduction Act impacts that we'll see this quarter, and then how you might think about some of the tailwinds that we've got. I think to provide a little bit more detail, so starting January 1, Medicare will pay 60% to 70% less for the first 10 negotiated drugs. I think important to stress that this is really only Medicare. Those lower reimbursements will translate into lower sales, i.e., the price at which we sell, and that creates the headwind that we've talked about. I think also important to note that manufacturers will offer rebates to us to offset that.\nSo this will have no margin impact in the quarter and no earnings impact, and we expect that dynamic to continue on an ongoing basis. As we think about the tailwinds that we have to maintain really good performance in our ID sales, our long-term trends are, we're seeing units improve in our core business. We've got expecting to continue to invest in making sure our price gaps. We've got headroom on Our Brands. We've got, I think, a whole range of different initiatives to keep core momentum in our business moving along strongly to offset some of the impacts from what we're going to see going forward on our pharmacy business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nMorning, Kelly.\n\nOperator\n\nKelly, your line is open.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, BMO\n\nThere we go. Thanks for taking our question.\nCan you just maybe help parse out more specifically the impact of pharmacy on the quarter? It sounds like you're estimating some slight market share improvements, but I think a lot of investors are really just trying to understand what's happening with the core grocery business with inflation and units and market share. Any color you can give there. And then also just going back to the reinvestment of the e-commerce losses, maybe can you talk about how much you're planning there? How much is planning to go towards price versus store standards? And maybe just your assessment of those two key factors on where your price positioning is and your store standards. Is this going to be a broad-based investment across many stores, more targeted in certain areas? Any color on how we should think about that and what that might do for next year?\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nKelly, let me take that initially, and then I'll turn over to Ron. So I think pharmacy in the quarter, I would think of the impact of pharmacy business similar to what we've been seeing over recent quarters. So I don't think there's a material change in what we've seen from a pharmacy performance this quarter. I think the second question was around units and what we're seeing on the core business. We did see a slight deceleration in our unit trends in Q3. If you sort of dissect where that's coming from, actually discretionary categories were probably the most impacted. We also saw some impacts in our meat business due to the higher inflation that we've been seeing. But I think it's also important to say that actually unit trends improved or held up in a number of areas.\nWe saw good improvement in the deli, and actually natural and organic foods held up really, really well. I think these trends changed given some of the broader dynamics that Ron talked about at the beginning, SNAP, and the sort of broader macro consumer environment. In terms of the tailwind that we have next year from our e-commerce business, we haven't yet declared how we're going to split that money up. Obviously, we'll provide more details when we get into 2026 guidance. But as we'd said, we expect to use some of the money to reinvest back into pricing to make ourselves even more competitive. We've got a whole range of different opportunities to invest to improve the customer and in-store experience, which we believe will also help improve composite scores.\nBut we're also committed on an ongoing basis, as we've said, to improve the operating margins of the business, and we expect to do that next year as well.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nAnd David, the only area I would add would be kind of technology. I think we've got some technology spend that is in the pipeline that we want to make sure that we can continue to grow not only our retail business, but also our e-commerce business, which is rapidly evolving.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please go ahead.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nMorning, Michael.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Good morning, Ron. Two-part unrelated question.\nThe first is, as you went through your e-commerce review, how did you think about the risk of leaning so heavily on third-party providers to fulfill a core competency, which is to interact with the customer at the point of delivery versus having that key function more in-house? And also, as part of the e-commerce review, you mentioned that it's going to be profitable next year. Is that simply a function of the $400 million of losses going away, or are there other factors that we should consider to drive that profitability? And just one last unrelated point. As you think about 2026, do you expect the rate of growth for the grocery industry just to be more sluggish overall, given this 100 basis points headwind from the pharmacy change, along with what could be a headwind from snacks next year? Thank you very much.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nSure.\nI'll start, and then I'll turn it over to David. In terms of, you asked the question about the providers that are going to be doing some more of our delivery. One, we're really excited about the connection. I think each of those partners really brings distinct customer service, serves distinct customer needs as well as occasions. Some are full basket stock-up delivery companies, and some are really more about immediate convenience. I think we're looking at these partners as incremental sales opportunities and customer opportunities. The vast majority of our e-commerce sales come from the Kroger website, and we feel like they give us operational flexibility as well as strategic flexibility. You think about Instacart, which is our largest partner. They deliver broad geographic reach. They've got great scale. They can handle very large basket sizes. We also can offer agentic shopping capability on Kroger's iOS platform.\nUber Eats, that leverages Uber's existing customer base and the Uber app. I think the benefits here are add-on economics. Customers can order grocery items and do with the restaurant orders. That certainly appeals to younger customers who want more speed, more convenience. I think those represent new and younger customers for the company. Then DoorDash. David talked about how successful that launch has been. There again, we're focusing on speed. We're focusing on convenience. It is ideal for quick small basket needs. Again, it appeals to younger customers. In terms of the 400 million, I'll ask David to weigh in on that one.\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nYeah. So Michael, the way I think about e-commerce profitability is, I mean, as we've been saying, we're already making good improvements in profitability on the business as it exists today.\nIn fact, in Q3, we actually cut the losses that we've been making in half. So we're making really, really good quarter-over-quarter improvements in profitability, and I'd expect that to continue into next year. You then take the $400 million that we've talked about, which is from closing the automated fulfillment centers. You then add in the business that we believe is highly incremental from the new third parties that we're working with, so DoorDash and Uber Eats, as well as continued growth from our Instacart business. You've got the media business that we expect to continue to grow, and importantly, the media sharing opportunities that we have with our new partners. And when you put all that together, that allows us to expect that we will make money in e-commerce next year.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nMichael, your third question, I'm not sure I'm qualified to speak for the rate of the grocery industry growth rate for 2026, and I certainly don't want to get into any guidance at this point. We'll do that next quarter. I don't know that there's any reason why there should be this dramatic slowdown in the grocery industry, and certainly not for us. We've got new store growth coming. We're closing kind of unproductive and low-performing stores. e-commerce has had a great year and continues to accelerate. It seems like every month more and more. The mix might change a bit there because e-commerce will grow faster than physical stores. We've got a lot going on in fresh categories. Our Brands continue to grow faster than the house. Then finally, we want to continue to execute very well in our stores, and customer service matters.\nI'm not sure that I see a slowdown for 2026.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Jacob Aiken-Phillips of Melius Research. Jacob, please go ahead.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nHey, good morning, Jacob.\n\nJacob Aiken?Phillips\n\nVP, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning. So on the last call, you talked about how you're kind of working on how you discuss the retail media business with vendors or across the organization. And today, you highlighted some new opportunities with the three partnerships. I'm just curious, as more impressions originate on the partner platforms, how are you structuring the relationships so that you have the right level of first-party data? And should we think of the economics as comparable first-party versus third-party for retail media?\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nJacob, let me take that one. It was a little hard to hear your question. Your line's breaking up, but hopefully, I got the gist of it.\nSo we're seeing good performance from our retail media business today. So in Q3, we saw another quarter of double-digit growth, and we think we've got good plans for Q4. And our plans lead us to believe, actually, that that business will accelerate into Q4. And obviously, we'll share more specific guidance as we get into next year. And I think the foundation of this is great tools with best-in-class capabilities for the brands that choose to operate on the platforms. Now, as we think about the new partnerships that we've got going forward, the really important thing that was important for us as we structured those relationships is to make sure that we got to participate in the media opportunities that exist and that may originate on their platform rather than our platform.\nObviously, I don't want to get into the details of the specifics of how we've structured those agreements, but we've structured them in a way that we benefit, what I would call, appropriately from that in a way that's very favorable to our economics.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question goes to Seth Sigman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nHey, Seth.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I think there was a comment that you feel good about quarter-to-date. I'm not sure if that implies trends have improved or not, but is there anything more you can share about that and what may be driving that if it is improving? And you mentioned price investments. I'm just curious, is that playing a role? And then a bigger question on price investments. You were doing a lot of testing this year.\nIs there anything else you can share about what is working versus what is not working? Thank you.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nYeah, I think it's a little early to kind of opine about the fourth quarter. We're just three or four weeks into the quarter. Just to be clear, I said that quarter-to-date, we are trending ahead of our guidance that we shared with you this morning. In terms of price investments, it's a little hard to know those in real time. We continue to make price investments. We will continue to do that throughout the quarter. I think what we're seeing with our promotional kind of environment out there is that customers are responding to promotion, and we will continue to do that. I don't know what, David.\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nYeah, just sorry. One slight clarification just to make sure the point on Q4 is crystal clear.\nWe're trending quarter-to-date slightly above the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. Thank you.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah. And Ron, did you want to tell us about the next question? Thank you.\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nSorry, let me take that one. I think there was a second question on there, Seth, about price investments. Listen, we continue to make sure that we offer great value for the consumer. As Ron talked about, a great example was towards the end of the quarter when we knew consumers were struggling, given SNAP benefits being withheld. We invested in what we believed was an appropriate way and also a very responsible way with our margins to bring the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner down, as well as lower prices through promotions on a number of critical items for households. And I think we'll continue to do that.\nValue is at the foundation of what we do, and we'll continue to do that in a responsible way.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you. The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nHey, good morning, Simeon.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, Ron. Hi, David. Good morning. Two questions. The first, e-commerce. Now that you'll be in the green next year, can you talk about the scalability or maybe incremental margins? Does it move quicker, or it's still a long evolution? And part two, since you've been in your role, Ron, there's been some significant change, strategic change, tactical change. Today's call sounded a little more urgent with some pricing, folks coming back to work, etc. I don't know if that's a fair read or not. Can you say if it is?\nAnd then I guess new CEO should be very little interruption as far as execution goes, because it sounds like the plans are all being built today. Thanks.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nLet me ask David to cover the first, and I'll cover the second.\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nYeah, let me take the first one. So obviously, the economics are very eCommerce business with the outcome of the strategic review have changed. So we now move from a business that was in the red to a business that's now in the green. We've had a really good growing business now for many quarters. And I think with the new partnerships that we've signed, with the stores that we're building, with the strong growth that we're really seeing across all elements of our eCommerce business, I think what that allows us to do is continue to scale the business in a way that we now make money.\nSo I think as you think about that going forward, I'm not sure we see a dramatic change in the growth rate, but I'd expect us to see continued strong double-digit growth from the e-commerce business going forward, with the change being that that business is now profitable.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co",
    "content2": "And Simeon, just to get into the second point, I've been here, I think this is my 10th month, and my only objective is to set up a company for future success. We got to do the right things, and we're going to do the right things even if some of the decisions are hard. And you ask about urgency, I'm not sure there's any more urgency. I'm always urgent about everything. And I think going fast needs to be a key element of our culture.\nI think being willing to make the tough decisions needs to be a key part of our culture. To the support, we've gotten great support. The Board has been very supportive of those things that we need to do to set the company up for future success. Frankly, our management team has really embraced the speed, the decisions, the focus on the customer, and the focus on kind of moving some of the influence from our corporate office to our divisions where our customers are. Then five days a week, it's frankly just a function of the fact that that's just retail. I mean, we need to be here. We need to collaborate. We need to be able to respond quickly. We need to be able to support our stores that operate seven days a week, as well as our manufacturing facilities and our distribution facilities.\nSo I wouldn't say there's more urgency, but I would say that there's plenty of urgency.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Thomas Palmer of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Palmer\n\nVP and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning, Ron.\nThanks for the question. In the release discussing the fulfillment center closures, there was the mention right of the $400 million in savings. Could maybe get a little bit of a breakdown of where these savings will be seen? I think some of it might be depreciation, some of it other operating costs. And then when we're thinking about the reinvestment, how much of this is investment that you probably would have undertaken anyway, and this just gives you kind of better ammo to fund it versus things that might not have occurred if the closures had not occurred?\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nYeah, let me take that one.\nSo as you think about the $400 million, you're right, that splits across what I would call kind of operating profit, kind of EBITDA, kind of more cash-related items. And then, of course, there's a component of it that relates to depreciation. So it is split across both. In terms of investments, the way I would think about that, obviously, and we'll get more into that in terms of when we get into guidance for next year, it's a combination. Clearly, it gives us fuel to be able to make investments that we were likely already going to make, but it also gives us incremental flexibility to invest in things that perhaps we were not going to be able to make. So we'll get into more details on that as we get into 2026 guidance, but hopefully, that gives you sufficient color.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nJust to add, I mean, the key of e-commerce: it's one of our fastest-growing businesses, and that will continue. In fact, it continues to accelerate. It's 11% of our sales. The focus is we got to make money on a business that's growing that fast. And it was all about we got to get profitable. We got to get profitable fast because that e-commerce is a key part of our future here.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nMorning, Rupesh.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back, I guess, just to CapEx, so going forward, more aggressive store openings, obviously a change in your e-commerce strategy. Does anything change in terms of how to think about the baseline CapEx spending for the business?\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nCapEx?\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nI don't think anything changes in the immediate term about the CapEx.\nI think what we're doing is prioritizing the mix differently. So we're reallocating more into our sourcing program and less into other areas of the business. We think this is good for the ROIC of the company and the returns on our capital because we get good returns from major sourcing programs. So I think of it more as a mix shift.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The final question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of North Coast Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nHey, good morning, Chuck.\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nGood morning, Chuck.\n\nChuck Cerankosky\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Northcoast Research\n\nGood morning, everyone. In looking at your store development, well, let me back up a bit. It sounds like you talked about the mid-tier customer pulling back some more in line with the lower-income customers. Is that a change that you saw during the quarter? And in looking at store development, anything going on at Fred Meyer that you might want to talk about?\nAnd could you perhaps talk about how its larger exposure to general merchandise has you thinking about that banner? Thank you.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nSure. Yeah. I can give you some big picture kind of comments about what we're seeing on the consumer side. As you've been reading, consumer sentiment has declined a lot over the last four months. And there's a lot of reasons behind that, whether it's a slowing job market or the government shutdown, the SNAP benefits, concern about inflation, and categories like beef and coffee and chocolate. I just think customers are managing their budgets carefully, and they're making more trips. They're making smaller trips. The idea of stocking up is declining a bit. And we're seeing this economy where high-income premium shoppers, they continue to spend while lower-income customers are pulling back more aggressively.\nIn terms of that middle bucket, I would guess, again, they're also looking for value. And the best indicator of that is our Q3 was softer in the later parts of the quarter because of the pause in SNAP benefits. So that would be kind of, I think, going forward. I think the consumer is going to remain cautious. I think there's going to be more focus on food items and less on discretionary categories. Does that impact Fred Meyer? I think it probably does from their mix of higher mix of discretionary and GM merchandise. But it's also, we're seeing it in adult beverages, snacks. I think the good news is that we're seeing this continued shift from restaurant purchases to food-at-home purchases, which should be good for our business.\nThen I think the other big trend we're seeing is eCommerce continues to grow a lot faster than physical stores. Fred Meyer, I don't want to point out a specific division, but Fred Meyer continues to perform well. We've got Todd out there, President Todd Kammeyer, running it. I was out there a few months ago, and I'm feeling pretty good about Fred Meyer.\n\nDavid Kennerley\n\nCFO, Kroger Co\n\nYeah. I think maybe just one thing just to add on stores and store formats as to how we think about that. We will continue to build kind of large stores around the 123,000 sq ft. We've also got a 99,000 sq ft format that we're going to continue to build.\nI think as we think about the future, we're going to continue to experiment to make sure that we have the right array of store formats to cater to consumers wherever they may be located.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's question and answer. I will now hand back to Ron Sargent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing comments.\n\nRon Sargent\n\nChairman and CEO, Kroger Co\n\nOkay. Well, thanks, everybody. Thanks. We had a lot of great questions today. Before we conclude our earnings call, we'd like to share a few comments with our associates who are listening in. The progress we've made and the strong results we shared today reflect your hard work and your commitment. This year, we focused on running great stores, delivering a strong customer experience, and strengthening our core business, really priorities that are essential to our success going forward.\nYour efforts are creating a strong foundation for Kroger's long-term growth. We're very proud of what we've accomplished so far, and we're excited for the work ahead. So thanks for everything you do and for your hard work during a really busy holiday season. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning. We look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. I hope to see you in our stores. And happy holidays, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines."

Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ron Sargent; and Chief Financial Officer, David Kennerley.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary.\nI will now turn the call over to Ron.\n\nRonald L. Sargent\n\nChairman of the Board & Interim CEO\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. We're happy to report another quarter of strong results, which demonstrates the clear and measurable progress we're making on our key priorities to simplify the organization, to improve the customer experience and to focus on work that creates the most value. Today, I want to talk about what we've accomplished, the proof points we see in our quarterly results and how our priorities are positioning Kroger for sustained long-term growth.\nOver the last several months, we've made good progress to position the company for future success. A key part of that success is a strong leadership team. And during the quarter, we continued to upgrade our team. We promoted a tough division president to lead our brands, one of our key growth initiatives. We hired a new Head of Product sourcing who will help us lower our cost of goods sold and close the gap with the industry's best-in-class. We're welcome to new General Counsel, and we continue to elevate strong retail leaders across the company, including several new division presidents.\nAs we continue to build our leadership team, we're also looking at our costs, especially those expenses that don't directly support our priorities or deliver value to our shareholders. As we shared last quarter, we've begun closing approximately 60 unprofitable stores. Last month, we also reduced our corporate administrative team by nearly 1,000 associates. While these decisions are difficult, they are also necessary for the company's long-term success.\nAdditionally, in order to create greater focus and simplify our business, we're reviewing all noncore assets to determine their ongoing contribution and role within the company. And finally, we recently put an issue behind us by reaching a legal settlement with C&S Wholesale Grocers. We are pleased to resolve the claims so that we can remain focused on serving our customers and running great stores.\nOur efforts to create greater focus are showing up in today's second quarter results. Identical sales without fuel grew 3.4%, which was ahead of our expectations. This is our sixth consecutive quarter of identical sales without fuel improvement. Sales growth was led by pharmacy e-commerce and fresh categories. We know that fresh products are important to our customers, specifically in meat and produce. These categories continue to outpace center store sales and reflect the growing demand for healthier options. Our sales growth in fresh category shows that we're making strong progress in the categories our customers care most about.\nImproving grocery volume is also important to us. We're making strategic price investments, which led to another quarter of sequential improvement. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we've lowered prices on more than 3,500 incremental products across our stores which is improving our price spreads against our major competitors. As we lower prices for our customers, we're committed to doing so in a way that keeps our gross margins stable. We're making our promotions simpler and have continued to reduce complex promotional offers. Additionally, we are making it easier for nondigital customers to take advantage of all the value Kroger offers by reintroducing paper coupons in every store.\nOur customers are recognizing these changes, and they're giving us credit for them. We know this because customer price perception improved in nearly every division this quarter, and we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in share. Beyond the price of the shelf, families are also looking for quality and value. Our brands products had another strong quarter with sales growth again outpacing national brands. Our brands offer unique products with high quality and represent a point of differentiation for Kroger. Simple Truth and Private Selection brands again led our growth. Looking ahead, we see our brands as a critical strategic asset, helping us grow sales and build loyalty with customers.\nE-commerce. E-commerce also continues to be an important and growing part of our business. Sales were strong in the second quarter with 16% growth led by good performance and delivery. We continue to make progress on improving profitability, and we saw improvements in both pickup and delivery profitability on a quarter-over-quarter basis. E-com remains a top priority for us.\nRunning great stores is also critical to our future and our store teams are delivering on the basics, being in stock, showing clean and uncluttered isles and making shopping easier for our customers. Our internal composite scores, which track key metrics like in-stock levels, fresh product quality and customer service are showing consistent quarter-over-quarter improvement.\nAnd as we are improving our store and e-commerce shopping experiences, we're also taking meaningful steps to reduce our cost structure. In the second quarter, we were pleased with our OG&A rate improvement, and we'll continue to aggressively look for ways to reduce costs throughout the company. We believe that many cost opportunities remain.\nSo to summarize, we've made strong progress so far this year, and we also know that we have a lot more work to do. Looking ahead, we're focused on investments that will grow our core business. The first of these is new stores. We're on track to deliver 30 major storing projects in 2025, and we are accelerating new store projects with more efficient layouts and faster construction time lines. In 2026, we expect to increase store openings by 30%, helping us grow both in-store and online sales faster.\nWhile we are growing our physical footprint, we're also modernizing our business to operate more efficiently and serve customers better. Artificial intelligence is one of the key tools to help us get there. Accelerating our AI efforts is a natural step for Kroger given our long history of leadership and data and machine learning. Where we've implemented AI in different parts of the organization, we're seeing results with more competitive pricing, shrink improvements and faster fulfillment, which enables 2-hour pickup for customers.\nThese are just a few examples of what AI is doing to help us better serve our customers with more and bigger opportunities ahead to both support our associates and improve the customer experience. E-commerce will also continue to have a meaningful and growing impact on our financial results, which is why we announced a thorough strategic review last quarter.\nWe are progressing with 2 key objectives in mind. First, we will improve the customer experience by using our stores to deliver groceries faster. Stores are our most important asset, and when we use our stores to fulfill online orders, the inventory is closer to customers and the last mile delivery costs are lower. As demand for convenience grows, we can leverage our store footprint to reach new customer segments and expand rapid delivery capabilities without significant capital investments, which leads to our second objective, improving profitability and reducing our cost to serve.\nWe're examining all aspects of our business to drive greater efficiency, including a full site-by-site analysis of our Kroger automated fulfillment network. Where we have seen strong demand in high-density areas, these facilities deliver better results than those facilities where density is lower and customer adoption has been slower. We continue to evaluate all options across all facilities to improve profitability while continuing to provide a great customer experience. We expect to share an update on our strategic review during the third quarter. We're confident that the outcome of our work will lead to both stronger e-com capabilities and a clear path toward profitability.\nFinally, we're starting the foundational work to refresh our go-to-market strategy. This involves a deep dive into customer data and a rigorous assessment of our competitive positioning. This important work will set us up for even stronger performance in the future.\nNow I'll turn it over to David, who will review our financial results in more detail. David?\n\nDavid John Christopher Kennerley\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, Kroger delivered strong results, which reflect continued progress in our core grocery business and robust growth in e-commerce and pharmacy. Momentum in our core grocery business is being driven by improved execution as well as a disciplined approach to price investments. By reducing the complexity of our promotions and investing more in everyday prices, we are sharpening our price perception with customers driving volume improvements while responsibly managing our margins.\nI'll now walk through our financial results for the second quarter. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 3.4%. Our sales growth was led by strong pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh results. We are encouraged by the continued improvement in grocery volumes, particularly in the perimeter of the store. Food inflation was slightly lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter but continues to trend in line with our original expectations from the beginning of the year.\nOur pharmacy business delivered another strong quarter, driven by core pharmacy scripts and growth in GLP-1s. Although strong growth in pharmacy sales impacts our margin rate, it drives positive gross profit dollar growth and improves our overall operating profit. This quarter, we've been pleased to welcome more ESI customers back into our stores. We continue to expect that the full return of the business will take time and in Q2, ESI had a roughly 15 basis point positive impact on our ID sales.\nWe continue to keep a close watch on the changing tariff environment. As a domestic food retailer, we expect a smaller impact than some of our competitors. We continue to be proactive to address exposure where we do have it, and our approach remains to raise prices as a last resort to ensure that we keep prices as low as possible for our customers. Tariffs have not had a material impact on our business thus far and as of now, do not expect them to going forward.\nOur FIFO gross margin rate, excluding rent, depreciation and amortization, fuel and adjustment items, increased 39 basis points in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. The improvement in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, lower supply chain costs and lower shrink partially offset by the mix effect from growth in pharmacy sales, which has lower margins and price investments.\nAfter excluding the effect from the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, our FIFO gross margin rate decreased 9 basis points, largely in line with our expectations to remain margin neutral. The slight reduction in our FIFO gross margin rate was primarily due to pharmacy mix with good progress on rate in the rest of the business. We have many levers to improve our gross margin rate over time and we will continue to use those to balance incremental price investments that improve our value perception with customers. We expect our gross margin rate for the full year on an underlying basis to be relatively flat as we balance the impact of pharmacy mix, margin enhancement initiatives and price investments.\nThe operating, general and administrative rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 5 basis points in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. The decrease in rate was primarily attributable to improved productivity and a favorable comparison to prior year, which included certain nonrecurring charges, partially offset by the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy. After adjusting for the effect from the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, our adjusted OG&A rate significantly improved, decreasing 41 basis points on an underlying basis.\nCost optimization is one of our top priorities and driving productivity has long been a core competency of this company. We will continue to build on that strong track record by identifying new and innovative ways to deliver cost savings across our business, and our teams are actively pursuing opportunities across multiple areas. One of the areas we're prioritizing is sourcing.\nWe see significant opportunities to optimize our costs across both cost of goods sold and goods not for resale. We also have a significant and continuing opportunity to modernize work across the enterprise, making us more agile and efficient and leading to a more streamlined operating model going forward.\nOur adjusted FIFO operating profit in the quarter was $1.1 billion. Adjusted EPS was $1.04, reflecting 12% growth compared to last year and our strongest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2023. Fuel is an important part of Kroger's strategy and offers an additional way to build loyalty with customers through the fuel rewards in our Kroger Plus program. Fuel sales were lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to a decrease in the average retail price per gallon, and fewer gallons sold.\nFuel profitability was also behind the same period last year, and we expect gallons sold to remain lower on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2025.\nOur e-commerce business delivered 16% growth this quarter, driven by an increase in both household and order frequency. This growth was led by delivery with orders fulfilled from both our stores and centralized fulfillment centers. We are seeing a clear trend of customers opting for faster delivery times, an area where we are well positioned based on our conveniently located store network, coupled with our delivery partner, Instacart. Today, we can offer delivery in under 2 hours from 97% of our stores. This capability is resonating with our customers, and we continue to see more orders placed in these short windows. This digital momentum directly fuels our Retail Media business, which had a strong quarter and is a key contributor to profitability.\nWhile we're encouraged by the performance in the quarter, we believe we have an opportunity to meaningfully accelerate our growth. To support this, we're actively reviewing the operating model and how we engage with retail media clients to ensure we are strategically positioned to maximize growth in this area of our business.\nI'd like to take a moment to provide a brief update on associate and labor relations. We made significant progress on agreements this quarter, which provides certainty for our associates and our business. In total, we ratified new labor agreements covering approximately 54,000 associates. We continue to meaningfully improve wages and benefits, and we value our strong working relationships with our unions. By working together, we're better able to support associates and improve the experience we provide customers. These collective efforts have helped us build a more stable workforce with improved retention rates, which in turn drives a better customer experience.\nI'd now like to turn to capital allocation and financial strategy. Kroger delivered strong adjusted free cash flow this quarter, which reflects the strength of our operating performance. Free cash flow is important to our model, providing liquidity for our operations and strengthening our balance sheet. At quarter end, our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.63, which is below our target ratio range of 2.3 to 2.5. This provides us with significant financial flexibility to pursue growth investments and other opportunities to enhance shareholder value. We expect to return to our target leverage ratio over time.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain consistent and are designed to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We are focused on investing in projects that will maximize return on invested capital over time while remaining committed to maintaining our current investment-grade rating, growing our dividend, subject to Board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders.\nIn the second quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 9%, reflecting the strength of our free cash flow and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Our quarterly dividend has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 13% since its reinstatement in 2006, and this marked the 19th consecutive year of dividend increases. Dividend increases are just one component of our broader total shareholder return strategy, and we plan to continue returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\nWe expect our $5 billion ESI program to be completed in the third fiscal quarter of 2025. The ESI is being completed under Kroger's $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization. After completion of the ESI program, we expect to resume open market share repurchases under the remaining $2.5 billion authorization. We expect to complete these open market share repurchases by the end of the fiscal year, which is contemplated in full year guidance.\nA key priority for Kroger is to improve ROIC, which includes reallocating capital towards higher return projects such as new storing. We are pleased with the progress we are making on these projects and are on track to complete 30 this year. As Ron mentioned earlier, we plan to accelerate these storing projects beyond 2025 and expect them to be an increasing contributor to our growth with a 30% increase expected in 2026, positioning us for sustained expansion and market share growth.\nI would now like to provide some additional detail on our outlook for the rest of the year. We are pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect continued momentum in our business. Sales have been strong, led by e-commerce, pharmacy and fresh, and we are encouraged by the improvement in grocery volumes. As a result, we are raising our identical sales without fuel guidance to a new range of 2.7% to 3.4%. For Q3, we expect identical sales without fuel to be slightly below the midpoint of our full year range. We are also raising the lower end of our adjusted FIFO net operating profit and net earnings per diluted share guidance to new ranges of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and $4.70 to $4.80, respectively.\nI will now turn the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald L. Sargent\n\nChairman of the Board & Interim CEO\n\nThanks, David. The team continues to make progress in running great stores. We are more focused on our core business and our customers. We're moving with speed, and we're simplifying the company. We are executing better in our stores, and we are seeing it in the results both our quarterly financial results and our customer metrics. Our customers are telling us they like lower prices and simpler promotions. They care about quality and value, and they appreciate better store conditions and better service. Our work is far from finished, but I'm proud of the team and the progress they're making.\nBefore we move into Q&A, I'd like to comment briefly on the CEO search. There is no specific news to share at this time but the Board remains actively engaged in the process. We'll now open it up for questions.",

First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ron Sargent, and Chief Financial Officer, David Kennerley.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up question, if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Ron.\n\nRonald L. Sargent\n\nChairman of the Board & Interim CEO\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Before jumping into the results, I wanted to share a few thoughts since I last spoke to you in March. After nearly 4 months as CEO, I've been very impressed with the many talented associates I've met across the company. Kroger has a strong bench of experienced operators and dedicated associates who can move our company forward. After spending my career in retail, one thing is clear.\nRetail always starts with the customer. It's pretty simple. Our strategies, our focus on our resources should be dedicated to how we can make the biggest impact on serving our customers. Grounded in these principles, my priorities in this role are to position Kroger for long-term growth. Accelerate top line sales and run great stores. We can do this by better focusing on our core business and by creating a growth culture in the company. Kroger has a long runway with many opportunities ahead and I'm grateful to be part of the team as we transition to our next phase of growth. In the past few months, we've made a number of changes to move faster and put increased focus on our customer.\nWe're directing investments toward projects that will grow our core business, including plans to accelerate new store openings. We are reassessing our capital allocation strategy to make sure we are spending our capital on projects that offer the highest returns. We are reviewing our noncore assets. We're aggressively looking for ways to reduce costs throughout the company, and we expect to reinvest those cost savings directly into lower prices and additional store hours for our associates so that they can better serve customers.\nFinally, we have restructured our leadership team to ensure we have the right talent in place. We created a new e-commerce business unit, aligning all areas of the online customer experience under [ Yael Cosset ], our Chief Digital Officer. We continue to elevate great leaders across the company by appointing Joe Kelly is our Senior Vice President of Retail Divisions as well as new division presidents and King Supers, Food 4 Less and Texas where we consolidated 2 divisions just last week.\nThese changes put talented executives and roles where they can support our stores and improve the customer experience. We are making meaningful changes to the business to create a culture that benefits our customers and our associates while improving long-term shareholder value. In the first quarter, we are beginning to see the benefits of many of these changes. This morning, we announced solid first quarter results with strong sales in pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh. Kroger identical sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 3.2%. And adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $1.49 in the first quarter, which was an increase of 4%.\nNow let's take a closer look at the quarter. Strong performance in fresh categories supported our identical sales without fuel results. Fresh identical sales were better than center store sales. We know our customers want healthier options, and we are well positioned to deliver them across our ash departments.\nTurning to Our Brands. As more customers serve for value, we are excited about the potential for the Our Brands business. We are growing sales by offering high-quality products to customers at all budget levels. This quarter, our brands grew faster than national brands for the seventh consecutive quarter. Simple Truth and Private Selection led our sales growth, highlighting that customers want premium products while also spending less.\nOur Brands is also creating new products that support customers' healthier eating habits. For example, earlier this year, we identified protein as a major customer trend. And soon, Simple Truth will introduce 80 new protein products to our assortment. Targeted directly at this important trend, these products include everything from bars and powders to shakes all from a natural and organic brand that customers trust. This is just one way that Kroger and Our Brands are innovating to stay ahead of what our customers want.\nE-commerce continues to be a key part of our business with 15% growth in the first quarter, driven by strong demand in delivery. To keep improving the customer experience, we are working to deliver more accurate orders faster and reduced pickup wait times. These improvements are attracting new households to e-commerce and giving our current households more reasons to shop with us. As our e-commerce business grows, it represents a bigger impact on our results. Our teams are committed to growing both e-commerce sales and improving profitability. During the first quarter, we made good progress. and delivered our best profit improvement yet on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\nTo continue driving improvements, our team is reviewing all aspects of our strategy and operations to improve the customer experience,as well as the financial performance. David will share more on this topic later. We know that our best customers shop with us through both e-commerce and in stores, which makes it important for us to continue building and running great stores.\nToday, we are on track to complete 30 major storing projects in 2025. And looking forward, we expect to accelerate new store openings in 2026 and beyond in high-growth geographies, growing our overall square footage and adding new jobs. As I mentioned earlier, we're simplifying our business and reviewing areas that will not be meaningful to our future growth. Unfortunately, today, not all of our stores are delivering the sustainable results we need. It's also important to note we paused our annual store review during the merger process.\nTo position our company for future success this morning, we announced plans to close approximately 60 stores over the next 18 months. We don't take these decisions lightly, but this will make the company more efficient, and Kroger will offer roles in other stores to all associates currently employed at affected stores. To recap, our top priorities are clear. We're going to move with speed. We're going to concentrate on our core business, and we're going to run great stores. This is how we'll position Kroger for long-term performance.\nBefore David gets into more detail on our financial results, I'd like to talk a little bit about our broader operating environment. Customers continue to spend cautiously in an uncertain economic environment. Many customers want more value, and as a result, they're buying more promotional products and more our brands products. They're also eating more meals at home. Kroger is well positioned to support our customers' changing shopping habits. We offer compelling promotions and fuel rewards, outstanding Our Brands products, and personalized promotions that offer families better savings on the products they use the most.\nWe're simplifying our promotions to make it easier for customers to save and to see clear value at the shelf. In fact, we have lowered prices on more than 2,000 additional products so far this year. As part of our work to keep prices low, we're also watching the changing environment around tariffs. Our business model is flexible to respond to those kinds of shifts. And as a domestic food retailer, we expect a smaller business impact than some of our competitors.\nWhere we do see potential tariff impact, we are proactively looking for ways to avoid raising prices for our customers, and we consider price changes as a last resort. Tariffs have not had a material impact on our business so far. And given what we know today, we do not expect them to going forward.\nI'd like to spend a moment talking about our associates. Our associates are the backbone of our company and are the people who create a great customer experience. One of our top operational priorities is improving in-stock levels, and we improved in-stock rates in every division this quarter. I appreciate our associates' hard work every day to make this happen.\nWe continue to improve our associates wages and benefits while investing in their development and well-being. These investments include hourly pay plus health care and pensions as well as technology that makes work easier in our stores, including a virtual AI assistant that is improving associate productivity and engagement. This well-rounded approach is producing results with both store and company retention rates reaching record levels this quarter. And when our associates stay longer, they learn more, take on additional responsibilities, and deliver a better customer experience, which leads to better sales.\nWith that, I'm happy to welcome David Kennerley, Kroger's Chief Financial Officer to our earnings call today. We're excited to have David with us, and I'm confident he will help us accelerate our growth and improve our capabilities in a number of areas. As part of this role, I've asked David to lead initiatives across several areas, including cost optimization, efficiency and real estate, so we can put more investment in our stores as well as our customer experience.\nNow I'll turn it over to David, who will review our financial results in more detail. David?\n\nDavid John Christopher Kennerley\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. It's an honor to be here today for the first time as Kroger's Chief Financial Officer. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to meet teams all over Kroger and I've been impressed by the breadth and depth of talent in this great organization.\nMy immediate focus is to build upon Kroger's existing momentum, leveraging our collection of unique assets and financial strength to accelerate our performance. To achieve this, I'll be concentrating initially on a few key priorities. First, capital allocation. We'll be highly disciplined in how we deploy capital, ensuring we invest in projects that generate strong returns with clear objective of improving ROIC over time.\nSecond, cost optimization. We will focus on optimizing our cost structure, ensuring it aligns with and supports our long-term financial targets and drives operational efficiency. We're going to modernize operations and ways of working across the board from corporate to our stores and supply chain to work smarter and more efficiently.\nNext, improving e-commerce profitability. While we've seen positive momentum here, my objective is to accelerate this improvement. As Ron said, we plan to review all aspects of our business to drive greater efficiency within our e-commerce cost structure and support growth for higher-margin revenue. Finally, growing market share. Kroger's collection of assets positions us well to win and grow share. My focus will be on ensuring we prioritize our resources to drive profitable market share growth, including an acceleration of storing projects and more competitive pricing.\nKroger is a world-class retailer today, and we are well positioned for long-term growth. My objective as CFO is to ensure we appropriately allocate our resources to where we have the best opportunity to grow and win while delivering strong financial returns.\nI'll now walk through our financial results for the quarter. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 3.2%, excluding adjustment items. Our sales growth was led by strong pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh sales. We are encouraged by organic script growth, including growth in non-GLP-1 prescriptions.\nOver recent quarters, we've seen improvement in grocery volumes, particularly in the perimeter of the store, which contributed to our sales growth this quarter. Volume improvement remains a key priority for us, and we expect sequential improvement throughout the year. We saw inflation slightly below 2% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year.\nOur FIFO gross margin rate, excluding rent, depreciation and amortization, fuel and adjustment items, increased 79 basis points in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. The improvement in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, lower shrink and lower supply chain costs, partially offset by the mix effect from growth in pharmacy sales, which has lower margins.\nAfter excluding the effect from the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, our FIFO gross margin rate improved by 33 basis points. The operating, general and administrative rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 63 basis points in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and an accelerated contribution to a multiemployer pension plan, partially offset by improved productivity.\nConsistent with our approach to managing future obligations, we made a strategic pension contribution this quarter. This allows us to prefund future requirements and importantly, help secure long-term benefits for our associates. Multi-employer pension contributions drove a 29 basis point increase in our OG&A rate in the quarter. After adjusting for the effect from the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and the multi-employer pension contributions at OG&A rate was relatively flat on an underlying basis.\nAs I mentioned earlier, cost optimization is one of my top priorities. We will look for new ways to modernize work and operate more efficiently, not only to fund investments in our customer experience but also to deliver on our financial commitments.\nLooking out for the balance of the year, we expect both our FIFO gross margin rate and OG&A rate on an underlying basis to remain relatively flat as we balance price and wage investments with margin enhancement efforts. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.5 billion, and adjusted EPS was $1.49 in Q1.\nFuel is an important part of Kroger's strategy and offers an important way to build loyalty with customers through the fuel rewards in our Kroger Plus program. Fuel results were behind expectations this quarter and a headwind to our results. Fuel sales were lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to lower average retail price per gallon and fewer gallons sold. While gallons sold declined compared to last year, our gallon sales continue to outpace the industry.\nFuel profitability was also behind the same period last year as a result of fewer gallons sold. We expect fuel will be a headwind to our results for the remainder of the year. As Ron shared earlier, our e-commerce business continued its strong performance. We grew e-commerce sales by 15% and increased our rate of profit improvement from our previous record improvement in the fourth quarter of 2024. We're pleased with our continued progress and confident we're on the right path, but our clear goal is to accelerate this momentum.\nTo that end, our new e-commerce structure unifies all teams contributing to our e-commerce experience with a clear mandate to enhance our e-commerce operations for both improved profitability and a superior customer experience. Their efforts will center on deploying new technology, improving density in our fulfillment operations and accelerating the growth of our retail media platform. We expect these initiatives to be significant drivers of our e-commerce acceleration.\nI'd also like to provide an update on recent developments concerning our contract with Ocado. Last week, Ocado drew down the entire [ 152 ] million from its letter of credit under our existing agreement. As mentioned earlier by Ron, we're undertaking a comprehensive review of our e-commerce operations and reviewing all aspects of the business to drive growth by improving the customer experience while improving profitability.\nI'd like to take a moment to provide a brief update on associate and labor relations. We made significant progress on agreements this quarter. Specifically, we ratified new labor agreements with more than 23,000 associates. Since Q1 closed, we have ratified a new collective bargaining agreement for store associates in our Mid-Atlantic division and reached a fully recommended settlement for associates in Seattle. In total, this covers approximately 16,000 associates.\nKroger is working to reach an agreement with the UFCW for store associates at approximately 80 King Super store locations in Denver Metro [indiscernible] and Colorado Springs. Associates at these stores chose to strike for 14 days during the first quarter, and negotiations are ongoing. We respect our associates right to collectively bargain.\nAs Ron said earlier, we continue to meaningfully improve wages and benefits. The company's investment in associate wages has increased the average hourly rate to more than $19.50. That figure grows to more than $25 with benefits like health care and pensions factored in that many of our competitors do not offer. We are proud to be a retailer, which offers fair wages and comprehensive benefits.\nKroger's [indiscernible] every labor negotiation is to provide employees with stability and advancement opportunities while working to reach a fair and balanced agreement that both rewards our associates and keep groceries affordable for the millions of families we serve.\nI'd now like to turn to capital allocation and financial strategy. Kroger generated strong adjusted free cash flow this quarter, driven by our operating results. Free cash flow is important to our model, providing liquidity to our operations and allowing us to maintain a strong balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.69 compared to our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA target ratio range of 2.3 to 2.5.\nOur strong free cash flow and balance sheet provide us flexibility to invest in our business and other opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent and are designed to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We are focused on investing in projects that will maximize return on invested capital over time while remaining committed to maintaining our current investment-grade rating, growing our dividend subject to board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders.\nA key priority for Kroger is to improve ROIC. We expect to do this by improving asset utilization and reallocating capital towards higher-return projects which will drive long-term shareholder value. As Ron mentioned earlier, we have announced plans today to close roughly 60 underperforming stores across the country in an effort to optimize our store network. At the same time, we are actively investing for growth in new store projects. We expect to complete 30 major storing projects in 2025, focusing our investments in high-growth areas.\nWe will continue to prioritize new store growth and expect these to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth model. We're delivering on our commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. We expect our $5 billion ASR program to be completed by no later than the third fiscal quarter of 2025. The ASR is being completed under Kroger's $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization. After completion of the ASR program, Kroger expects to resume open market share repurchases under the remaining $2.5 billion authorization. Kroger expects to complete these open market share repurchases by the end of the fiscal year, which is contemplated in full year guidance.\nI would now like to provide some additional detail on our outlook for the rest of the year. We are pleased with our first quarter sales, which reflects strength in pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh. As a result, we are raising our identical sales without fuel guidance to a new range of 2.25% to 3.25%. We expect second quarter identical sales without fuel to be roughly at the midpoint of our full year guidance range.\nWith respect to the store closures discussed earlier, we anticipate these will occur over the next 18 months. There is a modest financial benefit to closing these stores. However, we intend to reinvest the efficiencies back into the customer experience. And as a result, this will not impact our full year guidance. While first quarter sales and profitability exceeded our expectations, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, and as a result, other elements of our guidance remain unchanged. As such, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for net operating profit and adjusted earnings per share. I will now turn the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald L. Sargent\n\nChairman of the Board & Interim CEO\n\nThanks, David. We're off to a solid start in 2025, and we are optimistic about the rest of the year. While the broader environment continues to be uncertain, we're focused on serving our customers with great stores. Kroger is operating from a position of strength. Our strategy is flexible enough to allow us to navigate this changing environment. We are narrowing our priorities and we are moving with speed to deliver customers an even better experience. We are confident that by staying true to these priorities, we will generate long-term growth and attractive shareholder returns. Before we open it up for questions, I wanted to provide a brief update on the ongoing CEO search. The Board has a search committee in place and is working with a nationally recognized search firm. The Board is fully engaged, but we have no specific updates at this time. We'll now open it up for questions.",

Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information.\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our third quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the third quarter and walk through updates to our full year guidance. And finally, I will close with some comments on our pending merger with Albertsons.\nTurning first to our performance. We delivered strong third quarter sales results led by our pharmacy and digital performance, which reflects the versatility of our model. Customer engagement remains strong, our convenient, seamless shopping experience, along with incredible customer value through low prices, personalized offers and great quality Our Brands products, drove growth in both total and loyal households.\nAs we entered the last quarter of 2024, we are focused on providing the quality, fresh and affordable products that make holiday celebration special. Customer spending habits continue adjusting to current macroeconomic factors. As inflation normalizes, our premium and mainstream households are feeling more confident and are returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns more quickly.\nMainstream households are the primary driver of our positive customer engagement trends. While overall consumer sentiment remains low, expectations are improving, which positions us well for the holidays and into next year. As we said, near term, some customers are managing macroeconomic uncertainty. Spending from budget-conscious households remain under pressure as the effects of multiyear inflation and higher interest rates have had a larger impact on these households. Therefore, we expect it will take longer for these households to fill the benefits of economic improvement.\nKroger is delivering on its long-standing commitment to provide customers with the value they are seeking. We are helping customers save in multiple ways, including competitive shelf prices and loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and an expanded multi-tier Our Brands portfolio.\nDigital offers are an important way we deliver savings to customers, and engagement continues to grow, with 5% more digital offer clips so far this year, and that has led to 14% more savings for Kroger customers.\nWe are always creating additional ways for our customers to save. This quarter, we celebrated and thanked our customers with a Customer Appreciation Week, offering new great deals. And to help our customers enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, we lowered the price of Thanksgiving meals for the third consecutive year by creating a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person.\nWe are focused on executing our go-to-market strategy to deliver a differentiated customer experience through our focus areas of Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless. We appreciate our associates' continued efforts to elevate the customer experience and bringing the strategy to life by improving on our key priorities of full, fresh and friendly again this quarter.\nI would now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy. We are seeing long runways for growth in many areas of our strategy, starting with Fresh. Customers connect strongly to our Fresh For Everyone brand promise, which is a key differentiator for Kroger. Improvements across the supply chain as part of our end-to-end Fresh initiative, are increasing days of freshness.\nFor example, bagged salads now offer customers more than 7 days of freshness. Customers are noticing and it has led to identical sales and produce of more than 3% this quarter.\nIn addition, we constantly evaluate new ways to apply data and technology to provide an even better Fresh experience and deliver more days of freshness for our customers. One of the ways we are doing this is through recent implementation of RFI-embedded labels on bakery items. These labels provide us with greater insights into our fresh inventory, resulting in consistently fresher items and higher in-stock levels. We have seen encouraging results, including higher sales in locations and categories where we have piloted the RFID labels, and we look forward to scaling this to more stores.\nTurning to Our Brands, I would like to step back and talk about the significant investments we've made in Our Brands and how those investments are delivering value to both customers and shareholders. For years, the grocery industry offered private label products with the primary goal of creating products at lower price points. Several years ago, we recognized an untapped opportunity for growth in these products and envisioned the future where our private label products would match or exceed the innovation, quality and recognition of national brands, which is why we coined the phrase Our Brands.\nGuided by that vision, our teams built distinct and recognizable brands that our customers want and love, providing more value and meeting unique product needs that national brands cannot fill. Recently, we focused in on refining our brand architecture to optimize the portfolio and ensure each brand plays a unique role on the shelf. The successful addition of Smart Way, our new opening price point brand played an important role in rounding out our multi-tiered portfolio and offering an attractive alternative to national brands at every price point.\nThe next phase of the work involved refreshing designs and packaging, enhancing brand equity and reinforcing quality and improving the shopability. For example, to reinforce our long-standing guarantee of quality and freshness, we are placing guarantees on labels across our Kroger branded products.\nInnovation remains a driving force for our brand's growth. We utilize our data and insights to understand customer trends and meet increasing demands by consistently introducing new items to our portfolio with a focus on growth areas, including free from, organic and multicultural. This innovation enables us to differentiate ourselves from both national brands and other private label brands, creating destination items that help build customer loyalty.\nOur manufacturing capabilities will continue to be an important advantage for our brands. With oversight over the quality and the supply, we can develop unique and differentiated products while keeping costs low, allowing us to pass the savings to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins. A true win-win for customers in Kroger. This quarter, Our Brands continued to deliver strong financial results, which Todd will cover in more detail.\nNext to personalization. Our Krogers program provides our loyal customers access to savings and rewards that, in turn, drive traffic to our Seamless experience. As customers become more engaged, we gain deeper insights into customer trends, while creating the data that enables us to grow Kroger Precision Marketing, and deliver more effective promotions and relevant product recommendations.\nWe are working to grow Boost, the next level of our loyalty program through new benefits. And this quarter, we announced the addition of Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+ streaming benefits with Boost annual memberships.\nTurning to Seamless. Digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. Within digital, delivery sales grew at 18% and continues to outpace other channels. Boost is one of the important ways we are increasing e-commerce penetration, providing customers an affordable membership model for free delivery. Increasing e-commerce penetration is important to our model as households who shop with us digitally and are in our stores are our most loyal customers, and increase retail media monetization opportunities as well.\nAs our digital business grows, particularly in our delivery network, it continues to have a larger impact on our financial results. Improving profitability is a key priority and becoming even more important to our financial model. Over nearly a decade, we made significant investments in our digital capabilities building out our own properties, creating distribution channels in both Pickup and Delivery, investing in automation, enhancing personalization and introducing industry-leading retail media network.\nWhile each of these capabilities required significant investments, we now have a unique digital experience that our customers enjoy. Moving forward, we are committed to growing volumes, utilizing automation and introducing new technology that will create efficiency gains, while helping us narrow the profitability gap between online and in-store. Narrowing that gap will generate meaningful operating margin benefits and help drive shareholder value over the next several years.\nBy executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty, increasing customer engagement and creating more growth opportunities. First, with alternative profit businesses, which had another solid quarter. Kroger Precision Marketing continued to deliver the most significant growth from our alternative profit businesses.\nNext, in health and wellness. As the pharmacy industry continues to transform, Kroger has a unique opportunity to play a bigger role in helping patients live healthier lives while growing our share of the industry. We are excited about this area of the business, and its performance this quarter demonstrates we can grow this business profitably in a way that supports our customers to live healthier lives.\nSales and profitability this quarter were well ahead of last year, led by growth in both GLP-1s and vaccines. Our strong growth in vaccines reflect patient trust in Kroger to vaccinate them and their families during the start of the cold and flu season, the peak quarter of the year for vaccinations. Our health and wellness teams did an excellent job this quarter in building awareness around our vaccine capabilities, growing share and administrating significantly more vaccine this year versus a year ago.\nThese helped offset the product mix pressures from GLP-1s. Our vaccine efforts are leading to new patient scripts, which is important as these customers are more likely to become loyal households and spend more across the store.\nWe appreciate our associates for their continued efforts to elevate the customer experience by delivering on our key priorities of full, fresh and friendly. Team consistency leads to a better customer experience, and we are excited about another quarter of improvement in retention. Our focus on retention reflects a holistic strategy, including investments in wages and benefits as well as enhancing the associate experience through training, technology and career development opportunities.\nWith that, I will hand it over to Todd to take you through our third quarter financial results. Todd?\n\nTodd A. Foley\n\nInterim CFO, Group VP, Corporate Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results reflect the durability of our model with strong pharmacy results that help offset lower fuel profitability as we cycled strong fuel results from a year ago. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing the ranges on our identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. The strength of our model gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this full year guidance.\nBefore I look through our third quarter financial results, I would like to start off by covering a couple of items from the quarter that affected our financial results. First, during the third quarter, we finalized the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business for $464 million. The sale reduced total company sales in the third quarter by approximately $340 million compared to the same period last year, and annualized sales will be approximately $3 billion lower going forward.\nKSP was a low-margin business. As a result, the sale of the business increased both Kroger's gross margin and operating general and administrative costs as a rate of sales. It had no material effect on operating profit.\nSecond, on a year-over-year basis, the combined hurricane season and port strike had approximately a 20 basis point favorable impact on sales as customers stocked up in anticipation of these events. These events had an unfavorable impact on OG&A. Together, this did not have a material impact on total operating profit.\nI'll now take you through our third quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 2.3%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales without fuel were led by strong pharmacy and digital sales. We're also encouraged by the continuation of positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households.\nOur Brands had a strong quarter, with sales outpacing national brands again this quarter, led by mid-single-digit growth in our most premium brand, Private Selection. Customers continue to demand premium products, but at the same time, are looking for value. Our Private Selection brand is a perfect solution by offering our customers premium quality at an attractive price. These results demonstrate the breadth of our brands portfolio and the ability to meet customers' needs for quality and value.\nDigital sales delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, led by 18% growth in Delivery Solutions driven by our customer fulfillment centers. The CFCs are offering customers a superior digital experience with excellent in-stocks, fresher items and a white glove on-time delivery. CFC growth was driven by a significant increase in households and trips as well as an increase in basket size.\nOur third quarter identical sales without fuel results were affected by the Boar's Head recalls that began in the second quarter. We acted quickly with the safety of our customers in mind as soon as we became aware of the situation. Boar's Head is a strategic supplier with brand loyal customers that are an important driver of our deli sales.\nAs a result, some customers have temporarily migrated away from the category. It will take some time for those customers to resume their prior purchasing behavior, and we expect this to remain a headwind to sales in the near term. The unfavorable sales effect from Boar's Head had this quarter was largely offset by the favorable sales impact from the hurricane and port strike.\nTurning to margins. Gross margin was 22.9% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 51 basis points compared to last year and was ahead of expectations. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Our Brands' performance and lower shrink, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger's ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets.\nThe OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 22 basis points, driven by the sale of Kroger's Specialty Pharmacy and increased incentive plan costs, partially offset by the continued execution of cost savings initiatives. Excluding the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, fuel and adjustment items, our OG&A rate to sales would have been nearly flat year-over-year, demonstrating that our model can leverage expenses when we achieve our long-term ID sales without fuel goal of 2% to 4%.\nThis is made possible by a relentless focus on productivity and cost savings initiatives, which remain an essential part of our model. These initiatives are focused on simplification and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without impacting the customer experience. This quarter, we launched a new, internally developed generative AI-powered sell-through tool which helps us better manage inventory in both Fresh and center store departments through real-time insights tracking sales and shipments.\nThis enables our teams to increase freshness on shelves and prioritize sell-through, optimizing both sales and margins. Looking ahead, we plan to further enhance the AI capabilities on this platform by extending into improved forecasting and end-to-end inventory management.\nDuring the third quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $4 million compared to a charge of $29 million for the same period last year due to lower expected year-over-year inflation. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.02 billion and adjusted EPS was $0.98 per diluted share, an increase of 3% compared to last year. This was an important part of our strategy. Fuel rewards through our Kroger Plus program helped build customer loyalty.\nFuel sales were significantly lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to lower average retail price per gallon. Fuel profitability was also meaningfully behind a year ago as a result of fewer gallons sold and lower cents per gallon margin.\nI wanted to provide a brief update on inflation as it remains a topic of interest for many investors. Inflation was down slightly in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, but it remains around 1%. We expect inflation to remain consistent in the fourth quarter.\nI would now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for Dylan's Columbia, Missouri clerks, Central Division, Ottawa and Streeter Clerks, Northern Illinois Meat clerks, Fred Meyer Portland retail stores, and the Foods Co contract in Northern California, all covering nearly 13,000 associates.\nWe respect associates' right to collectively bargain. We're also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. These proposals stand in the way of operating our business in a way that ensures job security and advancement opportunities for associates.\nTurning to cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow with consistent operating results. Free cash flow generation is an important part of our model and is enabling us to invest in our business for growth. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.21 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhareholder value.\nWe continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. We're committed to maintaining investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to Board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so.\nI would now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. After delivering solid third quarter results, we're narrowing the ranges of identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. Additionally, we have updated our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate and expect it to be 22.5%.\nWe now expect identical sales without fuel for the year to be in the range of 1.2% to 1.5%. Quarter-to-date trends signaling, we will be near the midpoint of this range. Identical sales without fuel results year-to-date have largely been in line with our expectations, with Q3 being slightly ahead of expectations due to the favorable effects from the hurricanes, the port strike and strong vaccine growth during the peak season for immunizations.\nOur expectations for fourth quarter identical sales without fuel are consistent with our forecast at the beginning of the year. We expect Q4 identical sales to remain strong, but sequentially lower than third quarter, partially due to the cycling of weather benefits from the full quarter of 2023 that are not built into our current forecast for Q4 2024.\nWe now expect adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, and adjusted net earnings per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. Looking to next year, we are in the process of finalizing our 2025 business plan. While we still have many unknowns, we do expect Kroger to deliver FIFO operating profit growth on a stand-alone basis. During our fourth quarter earnings call, we plan to share our full year 2025 outlook in more detail.\nIn closing, we are happy to deliver another quarter of strong results, which reflect the resilience of our value creation model. While macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, our model has multiple levers, which enable us to navigate any environment, including grocery, health and wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses. This gives us flexibility in the ways we create shareholder value and confidence in our ability to generate attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders.\nI will now turn the call back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Todd. Before I open it up to Q&A, I'd like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey, and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business, while also preparing for the merger.\nI would like to extend a special thanks to those who supported the litigation in federal and state courts, both the associates who testified and the teams who prepared a compelling case about the meaningful and measurable benefits of the merger. Our teams are ready to ensure a seamless transition for our customers and associates from day 1. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons' organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers with an even better experience.\nAs we await the court rulings and the regulatory challenges to the merger, we remain confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive and we know how our customers shop. Every day, they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors, Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar.\nAnd as I've said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country. And we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength, and we are optimistic about our future.\nOur business is more diverse than ever, and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. Our strong free cash flow and strengthened balance sheet provides us with the ability to invest in our business and enhance shareholder value.\nWith that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are still in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning.",

First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carla, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements or predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our first quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the first quarter. Finally, I will provide a few comments on our proposed merger with Albertsons before we open it up for questions.\nWe're off to a solid start in 2024, reflecting the strength and diversity of our model as better-than-expected performance from our grocery business helped us manage fuel and health and wellness results that were behind expectations. Kroger is providing exceptional value and a unique omnichannel experience which, combined with strong store execution, led to growth in households and an increase in customer visits. As inflation moderates, we expect customer sentiment to continue improving.\nBut near term, many customers are managing economic uncertainty. While we expect health and wellness profitability pressures to continue into the second quarter, our recent improvement on store execution metrics and strong customer trends give us confidence that we are building momentum for a strong back half of the year, and we are well positioned to deliver on our full year guidance. As we've seen over recent quarters, customers continue to seek value and are shopping with us differently based on their financial situations.\nSpending from premium and mainstream customers continue to be strong. Mainstream households drove our overall household growth, and we improved our share of wallet with premium customers who are deepening their loyalty, spending more in our fresh departments, and enjoying more premium products such as Private Selection. Within our most budget-conscious households, we are starting to see positive momentum, and we grew households in this segment after experiencing declines last year.\nHistoric multiyear inflation across the economy, high interest rates, and reduced government benefits disproportionately affect these customers and are influencing their spending behaviors. Kroger's long-standing commitment to low prices and personalized promotions creates real value for our customers at a time when many of them need it more than ever. Food at home continues to be the most affordable meal option for customers. While food inflation has impacted every meal occasion, inflation and food away from home has been even higher than food at home inflation since 2019.\nWe are committed to making sure our customers can enjoy a great meal experience with zero compromise on quality, selection, value, and convenience. We see a significant growth opportunity to deliver convenient restaurant-quality meals at an attractive value, and we are expanding our ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat offerings. For example, after we revamped our fried chicken recipe, we created a meal bundle which feeds a family for $3.50 a person, a fraction of what it would cost to eat out at restaurants with quality that's difficult to beat.\nEvery day, we strive to provide an outstanding customer experience, and we are focused on sharpening our store execution to do just that. This year, we raised the bar on our full fresh and friendly customer experience metrics, and we are very proud of our store teams who are delivering an even better shopping experience with service metrics at record highs. To continue the momentum in our grocery business, we are committed to keeping prices low for customers and delivering a consistent experience on utilization.\nLeading with fresh, our store team's primary goal this year is to drive more consistent shopping experience, and that begins with fresh. We are introducing new technology that's enabling\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\nOperator\n\nWe have lost connection with today's speaker. Please stand by as we try to reconnect with them.\nThank you for your patience, everyone. We now have the speaker back on the line. Please continue.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nOur ongoing work to differentiate and elevate our brands is driving higher profitability. We are identifying new supply sources, using more effective promotions and improving product mix, which is contributing to further margin improvements.\nNow to Seamless. Delivery Solutions led digital results again this quarter with an increase in both households and visits. Pickup also had solid growth and focus on delivering best-in-class fulfillment led to strong improvements in key customer experience metrics. This quarter, our teams improved fill rates to a new record high, reduced wait time and delivered a significant improvement in perfect orders compared to last year.\nThrough the power of machine learning and AI, we are developing new ways to elevate the pickup experience for customers and, at the same time, reduce costs. With dynamic batching of orders, these tools are providing associates the most effective pick routes, which is enabling us to dramatically reduce pick lead time in our highest volume stores. Our customers love the Kroger delivery experience with refrigerated products delivered directly to their doorstep. As a result, the Kroger delivery network has experienced remarkable growth with sales nearly doubling this quarter versus last year.\nAs we focus on providing an incredible customer experience, we are learning and adjusting the delivery network. A good example of this is our decision in the first quarter to close 3 spoke locations to reallocate capacity closer to our automated fulfillment centers where we have higher customer density and better order level profitability. This decision does not impact Kroger's automated FCs or other spoke locations. We remain confident that our Kroger delivery network provides a differentiated customer experience and will continue to be a key pillar of our digital growth strategy.\nTurning to personalization. The combination of Seamless and our personalization capabilities generated another quarter of digital engagement growth, up 9% compared to the same quarter last year. Personalization enables us to balance the depth and breadth of our promotions more effectively and encourages customers to engage more with us by focusing on promotions that matter most to them. This led to an 18% increase in digital coupon clips compared to last year.\nCapturing more digital households is a key to our long-term growth model as these households are more loyal, spend nearly 3x as much with us, and drive our alternative profit businesses. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we create momentum in our grocery business. In turn, this creates the data and traffic to accelerate growth in areas like health and wellness and our alternative profit businesses. Alternative profit businesses had a strong quarter, led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing. KPM results were in line with what we expected and keep us on track to meet our full year expectations of more than 20% media growth.\nYesterday, KPM continued to broaden its reach by offering its custom audiences and ad measurement capabilities to advertisers on to Meta's social media platforms. This is another important step in KPM's growth, creating more opportunities for clients to reach relevant audiences in more places and providing better transparency to ad effectiveness.\nHealth and wellness grew its top line this quarter. However, profitability results were below expectations. We are optimistic about the potential of this area of our business. Our script adherence initiatives are on track, and our teams are providing excellent care, which helps patients live healthier lives. Additionally, our marketing plans and in-store activations, designed to raise awareness and attract new patients, are launching now to help drive growth in the back half of the year.\nTurning now to associates. Our associates are doing an excellent job elevating the customer experience and improving our full fresh and friendly metrics this quarter. Team consistency leads to better execution and retention improved again this quarter. We are retaining more associates through a holistic approach, which includes wage and benefit investments and also a focus on associate well-being, and this work is being recognized.\nThis quarter, Kroger received the 2024 Platinum Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health. This is the third consecutive year that we've been recognized with the certification. And for the first time, we received the top distinction. This program recognizes Kroger as an employer who creates a mentally healthy workplace for our associates through culture, benefits, compliance, and wellness programs. We'll continue to invest in our associates. When our associates have a better experience, they provide a better experience to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd to take you through our first quarter financial results. Todd?\n\nTodd A. Foley\n\nInterim CFO, Group VP, Corporate Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's first quarter performance reflects the resiliency of our model, which enables us to manage a variety of economic cycles. The strength of our model, combined with the momentum in our grocery business, gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance even as we continue to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty.\nI'll now take you through our first quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 0.5%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our identical sales were driven by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We continue to see sequential unit improvement, and our teams remain focused on returning to positive units later this year.\nInflation continues to moderate, which is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. And towards the end of the first quarter, we began cycling the headwinds from the reduction in SNAP benefits. Digital sales grew by more than 8%, which was led by 17% growth in Delivery Solutions. Gross margin was 22.4% of sales, and our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel decreased 7 basis points. The decrease in rate was primarily attributable to lower pharmacy margins and increased price investments, partially offset by favorable product mix, reflecting our brand's margin performance.\nThe slight decline in our FIFO gross margin rate was in line with our expectations. We expect our FIFO gross margin rate to improve beyond our first quarter results, driven by the core components of our margin expansion initiatives. During the first quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $41 million compared to a charge of $99 million for the same quarter last year. The decreased charge for the quarter was due to lower inflation expectations for the current year compared to last year.\nThe OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 22 basis points, driven by planned investments in associate wages and increased incentive plan costs, partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect the factors identified in the first quarter to continue, leading to a similar to slightly higher OG&A rate. We expect our OG&A rate to improve in the second half of 2024.\nWe continue to make progress on our digital profitability, delivering another quarter of improvement in our pickup cost to serve. It remains a long-term margin opportunity with runway to improve to increase volume and process enhancements. Our store associates played a key role in the cost to serve improvements, and as Rodney mentioned earlier, did so while they improved key customer experience metrics.\nAdjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.499 billion. Our adjusted EPS was $1.43 per diluted share, a decline of $0.05 compared to last year. Fuel continues to be a key driver of our strategy to build loyalty by providing compelling fuel rewards to customers. We continue to see more reward activity, with 8% more redemptions contributing to gallon sales, which outpaced the industry this quarter. However, our fuel profitability was below expectations this quarter, with our cents per gallon fuel margin down low single digits compared to last year.\nI'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy, resulting in an average hourly rate of $19 an hour and a rate of nearly $25 with comprehensive benefits factored in. During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Houston Clerks and Mean, Mid-Atlantic division stores in West Virginia, South Carolina stores in Colombia and Myrtle Beach and Portland distribution center and drivers covering more than 21,000 associates.\nTurning to cash flow. Kroger continues to generate adjusted free cash flow, strong adjusted free cash flow, through consistent operating results, which is enabling us to continue deleveraging in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the quarter, Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.25 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides ample opportunities for Kroger to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value.\nWe continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on projects which drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth while remaining committed to our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to Board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. As part of our capital investment plans for 2024, we shared last quarter our plans for approximately 30 major storing projects focused on higher-growth geographies where we have traditionally achieved a strong ROIC and operating profit growth.\nWe've made good progress on our projects so far and remain on track with our plans. While early, we're happy with the results from projects completed in the first quarter. We are confident these new storing projects will help advance our omnichannel strategy and be an important component to our sales growth and TSR model going forward.\nDuring the first quarter, we announced we had entered an agreement for the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business. As part of our regular and ongoing review of our portfolio, we determined that Specialty Pharmacy was not part of our core strategy going forward, and the sale will enable us to focus on our health and wellness strategies that revolve around our retail pharmacies. Due to the sale, a nonrecurring held-for-sale tax adjustment of $31 million was recognized in the quarter, and it has been reflected as an adjustment item in our results. The sale of KSP is not expected to have an impact on our 2024 guidance.\nI'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. Today, we reaffirmed our annual guidance, reflecting both positive momentum we are seeing in our business, along with a more cautious customer environment in the near term. In terms of quarterly cadence, we now expect a decline in adjusted EPS for the second quarter, similar to the rate we observed in the first quarter as we expect pharmacy business profitability pressures to carry over into the second quarter. This reaffirms where we expected to be through both the first half of the year as well as the full fiscal 2024.\nIn closing, our first quarter performance reflects the strength and resiliency of our model. We are strengthening our grocery business, which drives the data and traffic to accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. And we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Todd. As you've heard from both of us, our grocery business is performing well, and we are building momentum across our business. Kroger is operating from a position of strength. We have the right strategy which is resonating with customers, and we have the financial strength to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value.\nAs we continue to prepare for our merger with Albertsons, I'd like to thank our associates for their incredible commitment. Since we announced the proposed merger back in October of 2022, our associates have done an exceptional job preparing for the integration with Albertsons while never once taking their eye off the ball of serving our customers, advancing our strategy, operating our business and driving results. Because of their efforts, we will be prepared to hit the ground running as a combined company, ready to serve more customers from day 1.\nAs a more general merger update, in April, we announced an expanded divestiture plan with CNS, which directly responds to the concerns raised by federal and state antitrust regulators regarding the original agreement. We believe the package, which includes a modified and expanded store set and more nonstore assets, bolsters Kroger's position and regulatory challenges to the proposed merger, including our upcoming court proceedings. It also positions CNS to be a strong and successful competitor. We are prepared to defend our merger because it will produce meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates, and for communities across the country.\nCustomers will benefit from lower prices and more choices following the merger close. We have committed to investing $500 million to begin lowering prices day 1 following close, along with an additional $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons stores. Employees will benefit from Kroger's commitment to invest $1 billion to raise wages and comprehensive benefits, further building on our $2.4 billion in incremental investments since 2018. As union membership continues to decline nationwide, this merger will secure union jobs.\nAnd communities will benefit from the strength and the ability of the combined company to accelerate Kroger's commitment to ending hunger. As a combined company, Kroger has committed to donating 10 billion meals to families across the U.S. by 2030.\nIn closing, Kroger is off to a solid start to the year, positioning us well to deliver on our commitments. We continue to invest in associates and the associate experience because when they have a better experience, our customers do as well. Grocery results are off to a better-than-expected start, which provides the foundation for growth in alternative profit businesses. And our model is generating strong free cash flow, which has strengthened our balance sheet and positions us for future growth. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning.",

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd first like to take a moment to welcome our interim CFO, Todd Foley. Todd has been a meaningful contributor to Kroger for more than 20 years, and we are excited he is serving in this leadership position. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our 2023 performance, how the strength of our value-creation model allowed us to deliver on our goals and how it positions us well to continue our momentum in 2024 and beyond. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 as well as our financial guidance for 2024. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons before we open it up for questions.\nI'd like to start with Kroger's value creation model, which supports our optimism for the future. We are guided by our vision that when people think food, they think Kroger. To achieve this vision, we are delivering a best-in-class customer experience and investing in our associates. We know that when we take care of our customers and our associates, we generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders.\nKroger's go-to-market strategy includes 4 focus areas: fresh, power brands, seamless and personalization that propels a customer experience that will grow sales and build loyalty. Our team of associates powered Kroger's success by executing this strategy and delivering an outstanding customer experience. To attract, develop and retain our talented teams, we make holistic investments in our associates.\nOur value creation model enables us to balance investments in our customers' experience and associates while generating sustainable returns for our shareholders. We've made significant investments to strengthen this model and are now demonstrating how we can generate growth in more ways than ever. By delivering fresh products and personalized offers through a unique seamless shopping experience, our retail business creates traffic and loyalty that accelerates our growth opportunities in other areas such as alternative profit businesses.\nThis generates sustainable net earnings growth and increases in cash flow, which supports capital investments to grow the business, which in turn creates more jobs for associates and more career opportunities and enables us to return excess capital to shareholders. As part of our capital investment plans for 2024, we are excited to announce -- before, we are excited to announce that we are building more new stores in a meaningful way that will support our long-term growth model.\nWhen we launched Restock Kroger several years ago, we knew that a strong omnichannel experience was a key to serving our customers in the future. We are pleased with the progress we've made there, and we'll continue to invest in digital as it remains an important part to our growth model. In addition, we believe a strong and growing store network is important, many of the ways we go-to-market in digital still comes through the store channel. We know that our most profitable customers shop both in-store and online. So it's important to be there for our customers in a way they choose to shop with us. As a result, we expect new stores to be an important part of sales growth in our TSR model going forward.\nNow I would like to provide a brief recap of 2023. Last year, customers were affected by many factors, which pressured their food at home spending, including reduced government benefits such as SNAP, higher interest rates and the depletion of excess savings that many families accumulated during the pandemic. As a result, customers were looking for value to stretch their budgets. Kroger's commitment to lowering prices and executing our go-to-market strategy positioned us well to meet our customers' needs.\nBy delivering fresh products, enhancing our brand's quality and improving our digital experience, we grew loyal households in 2023, and our customers saved even more through our industry-leading personalization capabilities including loyalty discounts, fuel rewards and personalized offers. By increasing customers' digital experience, we can more effectively deploy our data sciences and our AI to serve the right offers to customers at the right time.\nIn 2023, our customers clipped 4 billion coupons, which is 1 billion more coupons compared to 2022. We know these offers help customers stretch their budget and lead to deeper loyalty. During the fourth quarter, our effective promotions helped turn traffic positive. These trends position us well and give us optimism for 2024. We expect consumer sentiment to improve in 2024 but our customers will still have to manage many of the same macro pressures as last year.\nKroger will continue to provide customers with lower prices and exceptional value. We also know that customers expect a great shopping experience, and we have robust plans to improve seamless shopping both in-store and online, where customers can get the products they want without compromising on quality selection and convenience. We are raising the bar on our full fresh and friendly metrics and investing for growth.\nAs with our brands, which enables Kroger to offer innovative products at a great value, growing sales and improving margins, we create destination items that our customers love and can only find at Kroger. This year's addition of the Hispanic inspired Mercado line to our brand's portfolio is an example of how our brands can innovate in categories that meet our customers' evolving needs and accelerate growth.\nIn 2024, our brands expects to launch more than 800 new products. As part of the next phase of Kroger's brand architect work, the team is reimagining their our brands portfolio with a refresh to look, which is based on the insights and preferences collected from extensive customer feedback studies.\nNext is fresh. Fresh is an important influence on where customers shop and we are continually trying to add days of freshness for our customers. With end-to-end fresh and more than 2,100 stores, we are seeing higher produce sales and improving share. Beyond adding days of freshness, we are expanding our assortment. Customers love our convenient in-store fresh-cut fruit program, and we will continue to expand the offering by introducing regional specialties and seasonal favorites.\nNow turning to seamless. Digital had strong results in 2023, delivering more than $12 billion in sales. Digital sales grew by 12% on a 52-week basis, and we improved our cost to serve through increased volume and process enhancements as well as technology to optimize associate pick routes for more efficient picking. Digital is an important growth accelerator in our business. And in 2024, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit sales growth.\nAs we grow volume, particularly in our Kroger Delivery network, we expect our unit economics to improve and become a tailwind to our long-term financial model. We have a clear path to improving our digital margins, closing the gap with our traditional brick-and-mortar business over time. Kroger is well positioned through our combination of stores and dedicated fulfillment centers enabling us to serve all customer trips, including both immediate and next day.\nCustomers value the ability to shop on their own terms with 0 compromises and we are increasing the number of omnichannel households in our ecosystem. Customers who shop both in-store and online spend 3 to 4x more compared to in-store only shoppers. Personalization is also driving digital engagement and remains one of the primary ways we deliver value for customers beyond low prices. By offering personalized savings we can ensure customers get the right promotions at the right time, allowing us to get the most important return on our promotional spend while enhancing loyalty.\nMoving promotions online allowed Kroger to take personalization to a new level, targeting customers more efficiently and increasing the breadth and depth of promotions. During the fourth quarter, this led to an 18% increase in digitally engaged households. Our digitally engaged households are extremely valuable to our long-term growth model as they spend more with us and help power our alternative profit businesses like Kroger Precision Marketing.\nOperational excellence is essential to bringing our strategic pillars to life. Our full fresh and friendly strategy is the road map to achieving a best-in-class customer experience. We were pleased to see the continued progress on these metrics in 2023, notably significant improvement in our in-stock rate as we achieved a new all-time high during the year.\nWe will continue our momentum on in-stock rate in 2024 to further drive sales as well as to improve our execution in these other key areas as well. By delivering our retail strategy, including fuel, we are building customer loyalty and expanding opportunities for profitable growth, including alternative profit businesses and health and wellness.\nAlternative profit businesses achieved solid results in 2023, generating $1.3 billion in operating profit. We were pleased with the portfolio's performance in 2023, where our media business once again delivered strong results.\nLooking ahead, we expect that the significant investments we've made in Kroger Precision Marketing last year will lead to more than 20% growth in our media business in 2024. The U.S. media landscape is evolving, and Retail Media is one of the fastest-growing channels. Systems built 20 years ago to power digital advertising, including third-party cookies are losing effectiveness and ineffective ad spending is creating more opportunities for those who use first-party data to connect the right content to the right customers while clearly measuring return on investment.\nKPM is well positioned to excel in this space by offering brands a superior advertising experience. Our media business can utilize first-party data from our loyalty program to create relevant audiences and measure ad spend effectiveness based on customer purchases, both in-store and online. To take the next step in this growth journey, invested in enhanced advertiser functionality.\nIn 2023, KPM launched its own ad platform and introduced a new self-service solution on ad buying platforms. The new ad platform makes it easier for clients to activate campaigns and gather data insights for advertising on Kroger-owned properties and the new self-service solutions are responsible for offering more direct access to custom Kroger audiences on clients' existing ad buying platforms.\nWe expect these enhancements will be key catalysts for growth in 2024. Kroger Personal Finance delivered mixed results in 2023, which led to relative flat year-over-year operating profit. Our credit card business experienced a challenging macroeconomic landscape, which led to an increase in customer bad debt. In money services we delivered strong results by implementing more fraud controls that allowed us to process payments more quickly while reducing fraud.\nTurning to health and wellness. Health and wellness delivered a better-than-expected performance in 2023, and we are excited about the momentum in this area of our business. As we find in other areas of our ecosystem, customers who are retail pharmacy patients are more loyal to Kroger than non-pharmacy customers.\nThe retail pharmacy industry is going through a period of transformation which presents a significant opportunity for us. We plan to deliver growth by focusing on a few key priorities. First, cultivating an exceptional patient experience. We are incorporating new technologies and simplifying our team's work, which adds capacity in our pharmacies. Our pharmacy staff is using this capacity to provide better care and faster checkout for patients.\nNext, we are attracting new patients by raising awareness to our nonpharmacy customers. Many of our customers are not familiar with Kroger's retail pharmacy operations. We are working to convert these customers by increasing our marketing and adding in-store engagement and utilizing our data sciences to help build awareness.\nFinally, we plan to build on our 2023 momentum in vaccines by accelerating share growth in 2024. By improving our outreach in store, expanding marketing campaigns and working with providers, we can grow vaccines and help customers live healthier lives.\nI'd now like to take a moment to talk about our associates. We respect and appreciate our associates for all they do to take care of our customers every day, every time. We firmly believe that by investing in associates and being an employer of choice, we can facilitate an outstanding customer experience. At the core of our operational initiatives this year is delivering a consistent store experience.\nTeam consistency is a key to that strategy. To support this strategy, we are taking a holistic approach to retention, which includes wage and benefit investments that Todd will talk on later, as well as investments in associate experience, including training, technology and career development opportunities. Investments in technology enable us to support our associates beyond the initial onboarding process.\nOur training app provides ongoing support and development during the flow of work, giving associates more confidence in executing their tasks and leading to a better customer experience. Importantly, associates are developing the skills for their next role with Kroger. We are pleased to see these efforts lead to strong improvements in retention this year.\nIn 2024, we will remain focused on further enhancing training and development opportunities, solidifying Kroger as a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd to take you through our financial results and guidance for 2024. Todd?\n\nTodd A. Foley\n\nInterim CFO, Group VP, Corporate Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Rodney, and thank you for the warm welcome. Good morning, everyone. Kroger's 2024 results reflect the strength of our business and demonstrate the evolution of our model. We are a more diverse business with more ways than ever to generate net earnings growth. Over the past 4 years, adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 20%, significantly higher than our long-term growth model.\nAs net earnings grow, we are also producing improved cash flows. And in 2023, we delivered more than $3 billion of adjusted free cash flow. This is strengthening our balance sheet, giving us the flexibility to reinvest in growth opportunities for our business and return excess cash to shareholders.\nAs Rodney discussed, our retail business is performing well and driving data and traffic needed to power our model and accelerate growth in alternative profit business. Kroger is entering 2024 from a position of strength. Many of the headwinds we faced in 2023, including the reduction of SNAP benefits and the loss of pharmacy sales from the termination of our agreement with ESI are cycling this year.\nRecent investments to expand our strategic pillars and grow alternative profit businesses are paying off. We remain confident in our ability to navigate many different operating environments and are well positioned to drive sustainable growth long term.\nI'll now walk through our full year 2023 results. Kroger delivered adjusted EPS of $4.76 per diluted share, including a benefit of $0.20 from the 53rd week. Excluding the 53rd week, adjusted EPS per diluted share increased 8%, which is above the high end of the guidance range we shared at the beginning of the year.\nWe achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 0.9%. Underlying growth would have been 2.3% after adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Digital sales grew 12% on a 52-week basis, led by 25% growth in Delivery Solutions. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, and the 53rd week, increased 18 basis points, primarily attributable to strong our brands performance, sourcing benefits, lower supply chain costs, and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts, partially offset by increased price investments and higher shrink.\nOur strategy to improve margin over time as many components, including the expansion of our brands improvements in digital profitability, including growth in media, utilizing technology to improve supply chain efficiency and enhancing the product mix through fresh initiatives.\nOur improvement rate reflected the investments we have made in these areas of our business, and it allows us to further invest in price for customers to help drive the flywheel in our model and continue to have a long runway for improvement.\nThe OG&A rate, excluding fuel, the 53rd week and adjustment items, increased 21 basis points attributable to planned investments in associates, investments in strategic growth initiatives and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts, partially offset by the continued execution of cost savings initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $5 billion and $4.8 billion on an adjusted 52-week basis.\nThe LIFO charge for the full year was $113 million. Kroger continued to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through our consistent operating results and improvements in working capital. Working capital improvements primarily reflected an effective inventory management led by our sourcing and supply chain teams. In addition, we cycled through the unfavorable working capital results experienced in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs a result, we delivered adjusted free cash flow of more than $3 billion in 2023. Our strong cash flow generation led to significant debt reduction and a strengthened balance sheet in preparation for our merger with Albertsons. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on an adjusted 52-week basis is 1.33 compared to 1.56 a year ago. Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $1.34 per diluted share for the quarter, including a benefit from the 53rd week of $0.20. Excluding the 53rd week, adjusted EPS increased 15%. Identical sales without fuel declined 0.8%. Underlying growth would have been positive 0.1% after adjusting for the effect of Express Scripts.\nOur sales trends improved in the final period of the quarter as we began to cycle the effect of ESI and unit trends improved in the quarter. The fourth quarter was our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in units and our teams remain laser-focused on volume growth in 2024.\nThe FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel and the 53rd week, increased 13 basis points, reflecting strong our brands performance, sourcing benefits and lower supply chain costs, partially offset by increased price investments and higher shrink.\nThe OG&A rate, excluding fuel, the 53rd week and adjustment items increased 40 basis points compared to last year. The increase was attributable to planned investments in associate wages and adjustment for self-insurance expenses and the decision to contribute an additional $40 million to multiemployer pension plans, helping to stabilize associates' future benefits and to reduce future contribution obligations. These were partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives and lower incentive plan costs.\nOur adjusted FIFO operating profit was more than $1.3 billion, driven by our strong performance in gross margin. This quarter, LIFO was a credit of $18 million compared to a charge of $234 million last year. This was primarily attributable to lower-than-expected inflation in our pharmacy inventory.\nFuel is an important part of Kruger's strategy, offering customers an additional way to save through fuel rewards and providing yet another lever for us to grow profitability. Fuel rewards enhanced customer loyalty and customers who redeem Fuel Points spend twice as much on groceries and by 3x the number of fuel gallons.\nFuel reward engagement was strong throughout the year as customers save 14% more of fuel rewards versus last year. Our fuel rewards engagement helped lead the gallon sales, which significantly outpaced the industry. The average retail fuel price was $3.14 this quarter compared to $3.39 in the same quarter last year, and our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.49 this quarter versus $0.51 in the same quarter last year.\nI'd now like to provide a brief update on associates. In 2023, we increased associate wages resulting in an average hourly rate of nearly $19 an hour at a rate of nearly $25 with comprehensive benefits factored in. Over the last 5 years, Kroger has now invested more than $2.4 billion in incremental wage investments. Kroger remains committed to supporting our associates with investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that are sustainable and will allow us to continue to keep products affordable to the communities we serve. We expect to make continued associated investments in 2024, and those are fully contemplated in our 2024 guidance and long-term growth model. Turning now to financial strategy and capital allocation. We continue to be disciplined with our capital allocation decisions, and our priority is to invest in high-return projects that support net earnings growth. We also remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade rating growing our dividends over time, subject to Board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders. We expect capital investments for 2024 to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion. which is consistent with 2023 in our long-range model.\nCapital investments will be aligned with our strategic priorities and expect to drive sales growth and improve margins. To drive sales, our focus is on enhancing the customer shopping experience and increasing store investments.\nAs Ronnie mentioned earlier, in 2024, we plan on completing 30 major storing projects, including new stores, relocations and expansions with a focus on investments in higher-growth geographies that have a track record of delivering strong ROIC.\nTo improve margins, 2024 investments will also enhance our supply chain, including expanding distribution center capacity and utilizing data and technology to optimize network efficiency. Productivity improvements and cost savings continue to be an essential element of our model and are key to helping us fund investments in associates and the customer experience.\nThese opportunities are embedded into all of our business areas, including in-store operations, digital supply chain and procurement. Our productivity and cost saving initiatives are focused on simplification and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without impacting the customer experience.\nLooking forward, we're testing new initiatives like customer pickup lockers, drive-thru lanes and AI-enabled store routing technology that will allow our pickup associates to be more efficient. Through efforts like these, we continue to improve digital margins, which remains a significant opportunity to improve total company operating results.\nTurning now to 2024 guidance. We expect to achieve identical sales without fuel of 0.25% to 1.75%, Adjusting FIFO operating profit of between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion, and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $4.30 to $4.50. This compares to 2023 adjusted EPS of $4.56 on an adjusted 52-week basis. We anticipate LIFO to be a similar charge to last year. We expect inflation to be around 1%, which is in line with the external forecast and consistent with our long-range financial model.\nWe expect to grow revenue by investing in value for the customer and enhancing our seamless shopping experience. We plan to balance investments in our business, including lower prices and increased associate wages with improved productivity and cost saving initiatives improvement on long-term initiatives in gross margin and growth in our alternative profit businesses.\nAs Ravi discussed earlier, growth in loyal households and digitally engaged customers position us well to grow profits and power the flywheel in our model. Overall, we expect FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, and adjusted OG&A rate, excluding fuel, to remain relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales without fuel to be stronger in the second half of the year. This reflects SNAP headwinds in the first quarter, combined with lower inflation. We expect inflation to be lowest in the first quarter but do expect it to increase as the year progresses.\nAs a result, we would expect identical sales without fuel to be at or slightly below the bottom end of our annual guidance range for the first quarter in the middle of our guidance range in the second quarter and near the top end of our range of guidance in the second half of the year.\nWe expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share in quarter 1 will be down low double digits year-over-year, reflecting our most challenging quarter for sales growth. Quarter 2 is expected to be relatively in line with last year. Quarter 3, we expect to ease double digits compared to last year. And Quarter 4 is expected to be in line with last year on an adjusted 52-week basis.\nKroger is well positioned to continue the momentum we've generated over the last few years. In 2023, we delivered adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth, in line with our long-term growth model and on top of our historic growth from the prior 3 years. despite navigating a challenging operating environment. We're evolving into a more diverse business, and our value creation model is providing us multiple ways to drive sustainable future growth. I will now turn the call back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Todd. In closing, Kroger delivered another strong performance in 2023, and I'm optimistic about 2024 and beyond. Our retail business is performing well. And by building loyalty, increasing digital engagement and driving customer visits, it is well positioned to continue that momentum in 2024 and beyond, which will accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on enhancing our strategy with consistent store execution to drive sales and expect to build sales momentum throughout the year as we cycled SNAP benefits in the first quarter resulting in a strong finish to the year.\nBefore we open up the floor to your questions, I'd like to provide an update on our pending merger with Albertsons Company. While we were disappointed about the FTC's recent attempt to challenge our merger, we were not surprised given the current political environment. Our track record in previous mergers is clear: Kroger lowered prices invested in associates, improved the customer experience and deepened its connections with the communities we serve.\nThe character of a company is clear in its actions regardless of what others claim Kroger keeps its commitments, and we're happy to share this with whomever is willing to talk with us. We know this merger will result in a secure future for union jobs. Krege2r has added more than 100,000 union jobs in a national retail environment as these union jobs shrank elsewhere. We are making historic investments in wages including $2.4 billion in incremental investments since 2018 on top of hundreds of millions of dollars in benefit investments.\nThe retail industry continues to be more competitive. We know our customers better than anyone. And every day, they make decisions about where to buy their groceries and how they eat. They shop with us they shop with a wide range of competitors from Costco to Amazon to dollar stores, and they eat at restaurants. No matter how others define the industry, we know how our customers behave and we run our business accordingly.\nThroughout my 4 decades in the retail business, I have seen that when we take care of our customers and take care of our associates, our shareholders benefit. This is true in the past, and this will be true in the future. I know you likely have questions on the next steps. Here's what we know today. The FTC joined by several states has sued to enjoin the merger. 2 states, Washington and Colorado have also sued separately. We are committed to defending the merger and litigation because we believe this is the best outcome for America's families. We cannot close the merger while these actions\nare pending. Hearing dates have not been set yet, but we expect these to proceed in the mid- to late summer. We remain excited about the future of our combined company. and we look forward to explaining the benefits of our merger. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking any questions on the merger this morning. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions.",

Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons before we open it up for questions.\nNow turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment, as strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth.\nCustomers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from 8 consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher-income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium brand products, these households are more profitable.\nAs we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays but the value across the entire store.\nTo help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year.\nWe have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices. Through our unique omnichannel shopping experience, we've achieved our tenth consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth.\nNow I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with Seamless. Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new 2-hour pickup service available in more than 1/3 of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter.\nTo become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality and value.\nTurning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year, and our personalization capabilities have resulted in an even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3x more with us and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses.\nNow I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our Seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher margin profit stream.\nRecently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration had already launched and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools.\nKroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's food-as-medicine philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes health care services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUp, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors.\nFood trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well positioned to provide important health care services and healthy food options.\nAt Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit. And I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day and the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just 1 example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger and hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission.\nAlso this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste journey, to expand access to affordable, fresh and healthy food and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched Zero Hunger | Zero Waste in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than [ 1.3 billion ] to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones.\nOur associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifeline and has helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior 3 years.\nI'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1%, adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first 2 quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, and a negative effect on the OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year.\nTurning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our Seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter 3 in the low single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace. We would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end.\nEncouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for 4 straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales, and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year.\nDuring the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements.\nShrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influenced gross margin in quarter 3 will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter.\nDuring quarter 3, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond.\nInvestments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year.\nKroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business.\nFuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchased compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year.\nI'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last 5 years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and [ 4 stores ] in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023.\nTurning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post merger.\nAs I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1% and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023.\nOur latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter 4 with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well positioned to navigate near-term headwinds, and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness, and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower end of our full year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with Albertsons Companies. As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue.\nWe have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day 1, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food.\nIn terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger nonunion operators in the future.\nIn closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.",

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.\nI want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information.\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. Given the breadth of information that will be covered on the call and our divestiture announcement earlier this morning, we will extend our Q&A session if needed to ensure that we can cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline the framework for our discussion this morning given that we have several important topics to cover. I will begin by covering the consumer environment and how the strength of our value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then Gary will cover our financial results and highlights as well as provide an update on our nationwide opioid settlement framework. Finally, I will conclude with some brief comments on the divestiture plan press release we issued earlier this morning. We are excited about sharing our plans for this important milestone, and we look forward to taking your questions during the Q&A segment of today's call.\nNow turning to our second quarter. Kroger continues to effectively navigate a challenged environment and delivered another quarter of consistent results. As economic uncertainty persists, the strength of our model is enabling us to deliver value for our customers, continue to invest in our associates and deliver consistent shareholder return. Value remains top of mind for many of our customers as they are balancing several factors that are impacting their food at home spending. The effect of sustained inflation reduced government benefits including SNAP and higher interest rates have pressured customer spending, especially for those on a tight budget. To support our customers, we are delivering increased value through our robust Our Brands portfolio, personalized digital offers, fuel rewards and loyalty discounts, including weekly specials and yellow tag promotions.\nEconomic instability continues to impact customer segments differently. We are seeing this in their shopping behaviors. Higher income households continue to engage more deeply with us, enjoying our customer experience with zero compromise on convenience, quality and value. These customers are especially valuable to our mix as they purchase bigger pack sizes, shop more Fresh categories and trade up to more premium Our Brands products. On the other hand, budget-conscious households are facing external spending pressures. These customers are buying smaller pack sizes and, at times, prioritizing the lowest shelf price. These customers are building smaller baskets and switching to lower-priced items to stretch their budgets. They are also exhibiting spending patterns that ebb and flow with payroll periods and SNAP benefit distributions.\nWe expect these broader economic headwinds to continue pressuring customer spending in the second half of the year. While the environment is difficult we are never satisfied with sales and we are focused on driving more units in the back half of the year. Our teams are sharpening store execution, identifying basket add-ons and adapting to customers' evolving needs. We saw an improvement in our budget-conscious household trends since last quarter as we expanded our assortment of everyday staples at lower price points. And as an example, we introduced new in-store displays where every item is below $3. Additionally, we continue to improve price position relative to key competitors, demonstrating our long-term commitment to provide customers with exceptional value.\nWe are creating more engagement with customers through personalization, offering more targeted and effective promotions and our seamless ecosystem is resonating with customer needs, and it allows us to drive increased loyalty. And customers are rewarding us for this work. The second quarter represented our ninth consecutive quarter of total household growth. And now I'll provide more detail on how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers.\nWe are reimagining our offerings throughout our portfolio of Our Brands. With more than 13,000 products available, customers can enjoy a wide range of high-quality alternatives to fit each customer's budget. Additionally, we are improving the profitability of Our Brands. Through our brand architect work, we are ensuring each brand plays a unique role on the shelf. Last year's introduction of our opening price point brand, Smart Way, provides a great option for those prioritizing lowest price at the shelf, and it is resonating with our customers.\nTurning to Seamless, Strong growth in our pickup and delivery businesses led to another excellent quarter in digital. This growth was underscored by a rise in both households and traffic. Our digital team's relentless pursuit of improving the customers' experience is driving our success. We scaled our hands-free technology across the company to improve speed and expanded pickup options with automated pods and lockers, improving productivity and providing customers with more flexibility. Our in-store associates are also playing a critical role in our success. This quarter, they reduced wait time, lowered cost to serve and improved fill rates. Pickup has had a positive incremental contribution for some time. In multiple divisions now, our pickup business today is now profitable on a fully loaded basis. And by continuing to scale our operations, we have a clear path to sustainable profitability and pickup.\nNext, on personalization. Personalization enables us to meet our customers' unique needs and deliver value beyond the product shelf price. Our best-in-class data science work powered by our loyalty data is driving strong digital engagement. So far this year, customers have clipped more than 2 billion digital offers. To me, that's just an amazing number when you think about 2 billion. We've also increased our digitally engaged households by 1.2 million compared to last year. This growth is important to our model as digitally engaged households are more loyal, spend nearly 3x more with us and help grow our alternative profit businesses like Kroger Precision Marketing.\nNow I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model continued to support earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Alternative profits had an impressive second quarter led by strong growth in our retail media business, Kroger Precision Marketing. Our seamless ecosystem continues to drive [ track ] data and traffic which benefits this business. KPM applies these insights and its data science to build custom audiences and precisely measure return on ad spend delivering significant value to clients. This quarter, KPM announced a new in-house advertising platform, which allows greater flexibility to serve clients and improve outcomes for brands.\nKroger Health is another important component of our business that allows us to help customers live better lives and strengthen our model. The terminated agreement with ESI has freed up some capacity in our pharmacies, and our Kroger Health teams are doing a great job of utilizing that capacity. Our pharmacists are dedicating more time to patient care and delivering better patient experiences. We are also simplifying work for our teams and lowering costs by expanding our use of automation. We are improving patient communications through modernized tools, which is driving better patient adherence to care plans and supporting growth. We are encouraged by the momentum in our health and wellness business and believe this is an opportunity for further profitable growth over the next several years.\nOur amazing associates are providing customers a full fresh and friendly experience every day. We remain committed to supporting our associates through investment in wages. And over the last 5 years, we've raised wages by 30%. We are also committed to supporting our associates development. I often say that our focus is to make Kroger a place where associates can come for a job and discover a career. Kroger has made significant investments to support this culture, and our teams have done a tremendous job creating training programs to help develop our future leaders. Your work was recently recognized with 8 awards from the Brandon Hall Group, a leading human capital management firm. We are so proud of the work you are doing to help make Kroger an employer of choice.\nI'm inspired every day to see how our associates bring our purpose to feed the human spirit. Our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste impact plan is a vital part of how we live our purpose in the communities we serve. Upon launching the plant in 2017, Kroger committed to donate 3 billion meals by 2025. We are so excited to share that we reached this ambitious target in the first quarter of this year, more than 2 years ahead of our goal. This quarter, we announced plans to accelerate our commitment to hunger relief. Upon completion of the merger with Albertsons, the combined company will donate 10 billion meals by 2030 to feed people struggling with hunger. To put that in perspective, it is enough food to feed every person in the cities of Seattle, Denver, Chicago and Boston every meal, every day for nearly 2 years. This is one of many ways that this proposed merger will benefit the communities we serve.\nWith that now, I will turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's second quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are enabling us to deliver consistent results despite the difficult environment, and this was very much evident when you consider the key trends we saw in our business in quarter 2. While industry-wide disinflation continues to impact food at home sales, our team is doing an excellent job managing the effects of this trend on our business.\nKey highlights for the quarter include EPS growth despite a significant year-over-year headwind from fuel profitability and underlying operating results excluding fuel improved versus prior year due to strong gross margin management, tight cost controls and continued growth in alternative profit businesses.\nI'll now provide more detail on our results this quarter. Identical sales without fuel grew 1%. Underlying growth would have been 2.6% after adjusting for the effect of the previously communicated decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first quarter, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin generate excluding fuel and the negative effect on the OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall effect on operating profit during the second quarter was slightly positive, and we would expect this to continue to be the case for the remainder of 2023. Our decision to terminate the agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the long-term best interest of our customers and shareholders.\nTurning back now to identical sales without fuel. In the second quarter, results were at the low end of our internal expectations as we saw food-at-home inflation decelerate at a faster-than-expected pace. Inflation ended the quarter approximately 350 basis points lower than the start of the quarter. Our sales growth was underpinned by strength in our digital business, which grew 12%. Our unique combination of assets, including stores and fulfillment centers, helped us achieve growth in both pickup and delivery channels. The growth in delivery was led by a continued ramp in volumes through our CFC network and Boost membership.\nGross margin was 21.8% of sales. Our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 35 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Our team is doing a highly effective job balancing the impact of inflation, and the improvement in rate was primarily attributable to strong Our Brands performance, lower supply chain costs, sourcing benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. These tailwinds were partially offset by higher shrink and promotional price investments. Importantly, as Rodney shared earlier, this improvement in rate was achieved while also improving our price position relative to key competitors.\nSupply chain efficiency is one of many components of our strategy to expand margin over time while continuing to invest in greater value for our customers. This quarter, we achieved meaningful operational efficiencies in supply chain through improved transport capacity utilization and increased productivity in our warehouses and across our network. We continue to invest in our supply chain as we see significant opportunities to further lower costs while also improving freshness to customers by eliminating waste in our ecosystem. Shrink increased during quarter 2, primarily due to rising theft and organized retail crime. We are implementing initiatives to mitigate the financial impact including increased security and new technology solutions, but would expect shrink trends will continue to be a challenge for the remainder of the year.\nDuring the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $4 million compared to a charge of $148 million for the same quarter last year. This $144 million year-over-year tailwind from LIFO partially offset the $192 million headwind we experienced in fuel operating profit during the quarter. The decrease in our LIFO charge was primarily attributable to a downwardly revised inflation outlook for the remainder of 2023. Kroger's OG&A rate was flat excluding fuel and adjustment items, Our team continues to do an excellent job controlling costs, and after adjusting for Express Scripts, we saw underlying improvement in our OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items.\nOur cost-saving initiatives are focused on simplification and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without impacting the customer. For example, we are improving productivity in our stores by expanding shelf-ready packaging and introducing data-driven enhancements to associate mobile devices that optimize the restocking process. We remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.\nFuel is an important part of our overall value proposition, and our fuel rewards program continued to drive customer engagement in the second quarter. The average retail fuel price was $3.65 this quarter compared to $4.62 last quarter. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.45 this quarter compared to $0.62 last year. While fuel profitability was a significant headwind compared to prior year, we were cycling historically high results from 2022 and fuel margins remain very healthy relative to historical trends.\nI'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Dallas Clarks, Southern Illinois Clarkson Meat and Smiths Utah Clarkson Meat, covering more than 30,000 associates. In the third quarter, we have also ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drugstore associates.\nTurning now to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and working capital improvements. At the end of the second quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was a record level of 1.31. This compares to our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA target range of 2.3 to 2.5. The company expects to continue to pay its quarterly dividends and expect this to increase over time, subject to Board approval.\nAs a reminder, we have paused our share repurchase program to prioritize deleveraging following the proposed merger with Albertsons. We continue to be disciplined with our deployment of capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. This discipline is reflected in our ROIC results, which have now improved in each of the last 3 years and is significantly above our cost of capital.\nThis morning, Kroger announced a nationwide opioid settlement framework to settle substantially all opioid lawsuits and claims against Kroger. As a result, included in our financial results is a $1.4 billion charge related to the settlement resulting in a loss per share of $1.54 this quarter. This amount was excluded from our adjusted FIFO operating profit and our adjusted EPS results to reflect the unique and nonrecurring nature of the charge. Under this settlement, Kroger has agreed to pay up to approximately $1.4 billion or $1.1 billion after tax with approximately $1.2 billion to be paid over 11 years and approximately $177 million to be paid over 6 years, each in equal installments. Initial payments will begin in December 2023 and would total approximately $140 million per year pretax for the first 6 years and approximately $110 million per year pretax for the following 5 years.\nThis settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability by Kroger, and Kroger will continue to vigorously defend against any other claims and lawsuits relating to opioids that the final agreement does not resolve. We believe that resolving these claims is in the best interest of Kroger and its customers, associates and shareholders and all of those affected by the opioid crisis. Additionally, this settlement and the payment terms will not affect Kroger's ability to complete its proposed merger with Albertsons, and we remain on track to achieve a net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 within 18 to 24 months post close.\nIn closing, I'd like to provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As I shared earlier, this inflation is occurring at a greater rate in 2023 than we originally anticipated and our customers are continuing to feel the effects of macroeconomic conditions. For these reasons, we believe the remainder of the year will continue to present challenges to navigate, and we expect identical sales without fuel will now be at the low end of our full year guidance range of 1% to 2%. We would expect identical sales without fuel to be slightly negative in the second half of the year. As a reminder, this guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023.\nDespite slowing sales, as demonstrated in our year-to-date results, we believe we have the flexibility within our model to navigate the impact of this environment through effective cost management and growing alternative profits. We are maintaining our adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted net operating profit guidance and would expect adjusted EPS to be in line with the prior year in the third quarter and slightly ahead of the prior year in the fourth quarter before including the approximately $0.15 benefit at the 53rd week.\nKroger delivered another quarter of consistent results built on the foundation of record growth over the past 3 years. While macro uncertainties remain, we are confident the strength and resiliency of our value creation model will allow us to continue to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Gary. Before we open up the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons Companies. This morning, Kroger and Albertson Companies announced that they've entered into a definitive agreement with C&S Wholesale Grocers for the sale of 413 stores as well as banners, distribution centers, offices and private label brands in connection with our proposed merger. When we announced plans to merge with Albertsons last year, we committed to delivering a divestiture plan that would ensure the stores will remain open, frontline associates will remain employed and existing collected bargaining agreements will continue.\nA critical component of that plan was to identify a well-qualified buyer who would be able to operate as a fierce competitor. Since then, we've conducted a robust and thoughtful diligence process and reviewed dozens of buyers spanning from private to public, to union to nonunion, domestic and international players. We are very proud today to announce the conclusion of that process which has led us to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a well-qualified buyer that meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction.\nC&S is one of the largest private companies in America today and an industry leader in wholesale grocery supply and supply chain solutions with a strong track record as a successful grocery operator retailer. Operating for over 100 years, C&S' retail footprint includes more than 160 stores and the company services customers of all sizes, supplying more than 100,000 products to more than 7,500 independent supermarkets, retail chain stores and military bases. C&S service offerings include a full suite of retail service offerings, very similar to what Kroger provides [ in the house ], including merchandising, e-commerce, accounting and store design, for example.\nThe company is deeply invested in the communities where it operates. And this retail expansion will continue their long-standing mission to help feed communities. C&S is led by an experienced management team with the financial strength to complete this transaction and also invest in the business for future growth. The company's comprehensive operational infrastructure and purchasing efficiency positions them to successfully operate in today's competitive environment. The divestiture plan ensures no stores will close as a result of the merger and that all frontline associates will remain employed.\nC&S is also committed to honoring all collective bargaining agreements, which include industry-leading benefits and further investing for growth. Importantly, the company also brings experience with the merger process having been an FTC-approved divestiture buyer in prior grocery transactions with a strong record of successfully integrating union employees and collective bargaining agreements. To help support the immediate and long-term success of the divested business, the divestiture plan includes more than just a collection of stores but also a robust operational infrastructure. Included in the sale are centrally located distribution facilities regional headquarters and strong teams with deep industry expertise.\nIn terms of consideration, the financial terms of this divestiture plan are in line with what we expected and allow us to reaffirm the compelling shareholder value creation opportunity this transaction creates. With the announcement today, we are confident that our plans fulfill all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for America's consumers, Kroger and Albertsons associates and communities that both Albertsons and Kroger serve. This key step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We encourage you to review the corresponding press release from this morning for further details.\nIn terms of integration planning, we are progressing well, and it's been exciting to see the talent from both the Kroger and Albertsons teams work together to plan on how the combined company will deliver an even stronger omnichannel food retail experience post close. We are incredibly excited about the future together with Albertsons.\nAs a reminder, given the breadth of information shared in today's call, our divestiture announcement earlier this morning, we will extend our Q&A session if needed to ensure we cover a broad range of topics. With that, Gary and I look forward to your questions.",

First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.\nThe Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up question, if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're off to a great start in 2023 with results that reflect the strength of our go-to-market strategy. Kroger is continuing to navigate a challenged environment as our customers manage the effects of high inflation, fewer SNAP dollars and macroeconomic uncertainty. Despite these conditions, customers continue to prioritize their spending on food and our value proposition is resonating.\nThe investments and productivity improvements we made over recent years have strengthened our business, allowing us to sustainably invest in price for our customers while maintaining margins. By delivering great value and driving strategic initiatives, we are sustaining momentum, which gives us the confidence that we will continue delivering on our commitments.\nMany of our customer preferences and trends that emerged last year have, as expected, accelerated into the first quarter. Customers are actively looking for ways to save, and we are focused on providing a fresh and affordable shopping experience with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are saving through loyalty discounts, including weekly specials and yellow tag promotions, engaging in our broad assortment of our brands' products and redeeming personalized digital coupons and fuel rewards.\nDuring the first quarter, sales made on promotion increased approximately 380 basis points, and digital coupon redemptions increased [ 180 million ]. We are delivering more savings opportunities, including working with our suppliers to fund more promotions. Kroger's value proposition offers something for every customer, which I'm pleased to say led to increased customer trips and our eighth consecutive quarter of household growth. That being said, we continue to see a split in spend across customer segments. The economic environment is more significantly impacting our budget-conscious shoppers while our mainstream and higher income shoppers are increasing their spend with us and deepening their loyalty.\nWe grew mainstream households, which make up the largest segment of our customer base. We also grew our higher-income customer households as they migrate from specialty retailers to Kroger. These customers are extremely valuable because they are building larger baskets and spending more per item. We see these customers buying premium our brands lines, more fresh items and larger pack size, and as a result, they are more profitable. In contrast, our budget-conscious households are buying fewer items, particularly as SNAP benefits declined during the quarter. In some cases, we see these households switching to lower-priced products and smaller pack sizes. The least loyal customer in this group are clearly prioritizing the price at shelf over other factors such as personalized offers, convenience and quality.\nWhile no one can predict the macroeconomic outlook with certainty, we expect customers, particularly those on tighter budgets, will continue to feel the effects of inflation and higher interest rates. We have started to see relief as year-over-year inflation levels moderate, particularly in fresh categories. We expect value and quality to remain in focus for the majority of our customers in the months ahead. Our attractive value proposition positions us well for this environment. In fact, our promotional pricing, personalized offers and fuel savings work together to create an overall value comparable to everyday low-price providers, and those savings come with much more personalized experience.\nAlong with our great value proposition, we will continue investing in and growing our strategic priorities of Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and Seamless to create a full fresh and friendly customer experience. As you know, we lead with Fresh. Our Fresh for Everyone promise connects strongly with customers and is a key differentiator that drives customers to us. We are constantly innovating by applying data and technology to improve the customer's fresh experience.\nA key to winning in Fresh is our supply chain. We improved our supply chain's efficiency through investments in talent and technology as well as controlling more movement of products across our network. As a result, our associates improved our in-stock rates, which drive higher sales. Through our end-to-end Fresh initiative, we are streamlining our supply chain to minimize the lapsed time from farm to shelf. Combined with our convenient store network, these investments deliver even more days of freshness at home for our customers. Together, these improvements also reduce our expenses, allowing us to invest in price for customers while providing fresher choices and more options.\nTurning to Our Brands. Our Brands delivered another solid quarter that led by our namesake, Kroger Brand, a national brand equivalent. Our brands are always a winner with our customers. In this period of sustained high inflation, it helps our customers save money without sacrificing quality. While inflation may have been the reason for some customers trying Our Brands products, the taste and quality makes the customer love these products and continue to repurchase them.\nFor customers looking for more convenience, Home Chef plays an important role and continues to innovate and expand offerings to meet growing customer needs. This quarter, Home Chef expanded its menu to bring more healthy choices, premium meals and new concepts. Our team unveiled its first dedicated family menu designed to make family dinners easier than ever. The menu includes easy-to-prepare recipes for larger groups with meals appealing to both adults and children and at an attractive value.\nNext is personalization. For years, Kroger has been at the forefront of using data and analytics, including artificial intelligence to build a better customer and associate experience. By applying our data and AI-based personalization, we can better understand what truly matters to our customers and deliver more targeted and effective experiences. As customers' digital engagement increases, we have new and more efficient channels to present the most relevant products and the right promotions at the right times no matter where and how customers choose to shop with us.\nAs AI advances, we continue to work and constantly evaluate potential use cases throughout the business with privacy and responsible implementation in mind. For customers, we see opportunities to further simplify the digital experience and offer more accurate personalized recommendations. Our teams are working with search algorithms and generative AI to improve substitution accuracy and search results. Within our 84.51° customer research team, we are already piloting several large language models to summarize customer database sets. By applying AI to customer surveys and customer service logs, our team can analyze and categorize them in minutes versus days before. This allows the business to react to customer feedback more quickly and accurately and then reflect these learnings in the customer experience.\nFor our associates, we envision ways to further simplify work through advanced algorithms that optimize activities such as store orders. These, in turn, help reduce out-of-stocks, improve inventory management and reduce expenses. Data is in our DNA. Our rich history as a technology leader gives us confidence that we will continue to effectively use AI, including more recent innovations. We also believe robust, accurate and diverse first-party data is critical to maximizing the impact of innovation in data science and AI. As a result, Kroger is well positioned to successfully adopt these innovations and deliver a better customer and associate experience.\nNow on Seamless. Growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses led to a strong quarter of digital sales growth. A significant rise in both households and transactions fueled this growth. Pickup remains an important part of our Seamless ecosystem. During the quarter, our team's focus on associate training resulted in improvements in the customer experience. Pickup Net Promoter Scores increased as we improved fill rates and reduced customer wait times, obviously something we're very proud of.\nSeamless starts with our digital experience, which we built to be simple, convenient regardless of how customers choose to shop with us. Whether our customers want immediacy of Kroger Delivery Now or to place a large stock-up order through our customer fulfillment centers, the customer experience is the same. This shifts complexity from our customers to Kroger. Even customers shopping only in store are beginning their shopping trip through our mobile app or website by clipping coupons and creating shopping lists curated for their store. These growing interactions contributed to the 13% increase in digitally engaged households this quarter. We value this behavior as digitally engaged households are more loyal, spend nearly 3x more with us and help grow our alternative profit businesses like Kroger Precision Marketing.\nOur associates continue to provide our customers with an outstanding full, fresh and friendly experience, better continuity on our teams and more engaged associates lead to a more consistent customer experience, and we are excited about the continued improvement in retention. This improvement reflects our focus on making Kroger a place where associates can come for a job and discover a career. Kroger is committed to training our future leaders and made significant investments this quarter. We enhanced our career development framework, expanded our leadership development course catalog and introduced company-wide development days. In the first quarter alone, our leaders engaged in more than 445,000 leadership development courses to strengthen their skills. We are excited for our associates' commitment to developing their careers with Kroger.\nOur associates are driven by our purpose to feed the human spirit, and Kroger's effort to build healthy communities are being recognized. This quarter, Kroger was selected as a 2023 SEAL Business Sustainability Awards winner in the environmental initiative category. We received this award in recognition for our progress in creating communities free from hunger and waste, which is a result of our team's collective efforts to more deeply integrate Zero Hunger | Zero Waste in our operations. We are incredibly appreciative of all of these efforts.\nIn closing, Kroger delivered a strong first quarter by focusing on delivering customers value through our Seamless ecosystem. We are growing customer households and trips, and our business remains well positioned for the environment ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's first quarter results clearly demonstrate the durability of our business in a more challenged operating environment. The investments we have made in our value creation model over recent years are paying off, allowing us to continue to deliver value for customers, invest in our associates and create attractive returns for our shareholders.\nAs Rodney shared earlier, we are driving increased customer engagement through our go-to-market strategy, which in turn is fueling our flywheel, including growth in alternative profit businesses. I'll now walk through how our execution of this strategy translated into solid first quarter results. Identical sales without fuel is a key component of our growth model. During the quarter, we achieved identical sales without fuel of 3.5%. Underlying growth would have been 5% after adjusting for the effect of the previously communicated decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts.\nAs expected, the terminated agreement also had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, and a negative effect on the OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall effect on operating profit during the first quarter was slightly positive, and we would expect this to continue to be the case for the remainder of 2023. Our decision to terminate the agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the long-term best interest of our customers and shareholders.\nTurning back to our identical sales without fuel growth in the quarter. These results were underpinned by key elements of our go-to-market strategy. Our Brands sales grew 4.9%. Our Brands continue to be an important source of savings for our customers who are attracted to the unmatched quality and value they provide. At the same time, Our Brands helped drive stronger profitability, typically providing 600 to 800 basis points higher margin compared to national brands. Our merchandising team is doing an excellent job optimizing our portfolio of brands to drive improved penetration and margin performance.\nThe launch of our new opening price point brand, Smart Way, has enhanced overall brand architecture, and our relentless focus on continuous improvement and innovation is driving strong momentum across the portfolio. We expect this momentum will continue to deliver value for the remainder of 2023.\nDigital sales grew 15% in the quarter. We saw 11% growth in pickup and 30% growth in delivery solutions, powered by our unique combination of CFCs and convenience store locations. Our Net Promoter Scores continue to increase and CFC volumes are growing in line with expectations in 2023. We are working closely with Ocado to make our CFCs even more efficient and productive. As a result of these joint efforts, our Monroe facility greatly improved the cost per order over the past quarter, and we're now in the process of applying these learnings across our other sites.\nAs outlined at our business update back in March, we believe digital will continue to be an important growth driver and anticipate double-digit sales increases will continue for the remainder of 2023. Gross margin was 22.3% of sales. Our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 21 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Importantly, this increase in rate was achieved while also investing in price to maintain a competitive price position and deliver greater value for our customers.\nThe improvement was primarily attributable to strong Our Brands performance, sourcing benefits, lower supply chain costs and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts, partially offset by higher shrink and increased promotional price investments. As we've shared previously, our strategy to improve margin over time has many components, including utilizing technology to increase supply chain efficiency, improving fresh capabilities, expansion of Our Brands, improvements in digital profitability and growth in retail media.\nThe investments we have made over recent years to strengthen our business in these areas were reflected in our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, this quarter, and we expect this trend to continue for the remainder of 2023. During the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $99 million compared to a LIFO charge of $93 million for the same period last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 14 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting planned investments in associates and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts, partially offset by sales leverage and continued execution of cost saving initiatives.\nAssociate investments are funded by removing costs from our business that do not impact the customer experience. This is an essential element of our go-to-market strategy, and we are on track to achieve our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in annual cost savings. Adjusted FIFO operating profit in quarter 1 was $1,669,000,000 and our adjusted EPS was $1.51. Both measures were [ up 4% ] compared to the same period last year.\nI'll now walk through how the other key components of our value creation model contributed in the quarter and support our plans to deliver sustainable growth in the future. Our health and wellness team delivered results ahead of internal expectations during the quarter, including positive ID sales growth despite the effect of the termination of our agreement with Express Scripts. This performance was led by strong underlying results in our retail pharmacy business.\nFuel is another important part of our strategy that drives customer loyalty and was a tailwind to profitability in quarter 1. Fuel reward engagement remained high this quarter with a 19% increase in discounts redeemed compared to the first quarter last year. The average retail fuel price was $3.55 this quarter compared to $4 in the same quarter last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.45 this quarter versus $0.42 in the same quarter last year.\nTurning now to alternative profit businesses. The significant traffic and data created by our food, health and fuel businesses continue to enable strong growth in alternative profits. Retail media is leading the way. And this quarter, KPM announced a new collaboration with Disney to bring its renowned targeting and measurement capabilities to Disney's portfolio of connected TV. Connected TV is one of the fastest-growing areas of ad spend, tripling in the last 3 years to $20 billion and is expected to double again by 2027. We are excited about the opportunities to accelerate KPM's future growth through this recent addition to the KPM ecosystem.\nKPM is also innovating in other areas, including in-store digital marketing. We recently announced a rollout of cooler screens in our stores. These innovative screens will replace traditional refrigerator and freezer doors with a digital overlay that will offer customers information on products as well as KPM curated advertisements. This will bring a differentiated shopping experience to our customers while also creating another powerful marketing tool for KPM to offer to our brand partners.\nOur first quarter results would not have been possible without our incredible associates who are doing an outstanding job executing our strategy and delivering a great customer experience. Our go-to-market strategy is underpinned by our commitment to continue investing in our associates to ensure Kroger remains an employer of choice. During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Atlanta, Louisville and Cincinnati divisions, covering more than 51,000 associates. We also ratified a new agreement with the United Industrial Workers for our Columbus distribution center. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for associates in Smith, Utah Clarks and Meat, Dallas Clarks, Dallas Meat and division.\nTurning now to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our operating results, combined with improvements in inventory and receivables led to a reduction in net debt of $1.5 billion compared to Q1 last year. As a result of improvements in working capital, we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for the fiscal year 2023. At the end of the first quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was a record low of 1.34. This compares to our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA target ratio range of 2.3 to 2.5.\nThe company expects to continue to pay its quarterly dividend and expect this to increase over time, subject to Board approval. As a reminder, we have paused our share repurchase program to prioritize deleveraging, following the proposed merger with Albertsons. In closing, I'd like to share some additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Rodney mentioned earlier, inflation started to show signs of deceleration throughout the quarter, particularly in the Fresh categories and ended the quarter approximately 400 basis points lower than the start of the year. We expect inflation will continue to decline as the year progresses and believe the environment will remain challenged for our customers as they deal with higher interest rates and an uncertain economic outlook.\nThese were factors we anticipated when we issued our original guidance, and the investments we have made over recent years to strengthen our value creation flywheel give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for identical sales without fuel and adjusted EPS. Looking towards the balance of the year, we would expect identical sales without fuel to be at the low end of our guidance range of 1% to 2% for the remaining 3 quarters of 2023, reflecting continued slowing inflation, partially offset by underlying improvement in unit growth.\nRecall this guidance includes the effect of Express Scripts, which is a headwind to identical sales without fuel of approximately 150 basis points. We expect adjusted EPS to grow within our full year guidance range of 2% to 5% in each of the remaining quarters, excluding an expected [ 15% ] benefit from the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. We would expect Q2 adjusted EPS to be at the low end of our guidance range as we cycle unusually high fuel margins for the same quarter last year.\nAs you've heard from Rodney and myself this morning, Kroger is operating from a position of strength. While there remain macro uncertainties that could affect our operating environment across the remainder of 2023, we believe we have the right strategy and the flexible business model that continues to generate strong free cash flow. This will allow us to continue to deliver value for our customers, invest in our associates and create attractive returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons Companies. Integration planning has progressed nicely and I'm energized by the people and talent across both the Albertsons and Kroger teams. I'm even more confident in the opportunities ahead as we accelerate our strategy and deliver more value for our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. We remain on track and continue to expect the transaction to close in early 2024.\nWe are working cooperatively with the regulators and at the same time, to identify potential buyers for the stores we expect to divest to obtain clearance for the transaction. We will find well-capitalized buyers with experienced management teams that will maintain competitiveness. We are very pleased with the level of interest received thus far, and we'll work towards finding a solution that benefits all stakeholders.\nWe continue to engage with various stakeholders in addition to the regulators and are actively working to address inaccuracies and misrepresentations about the merger. We made a commitment on the day we announced the deal that this merger is about growth and that we will not lay off any frontline work associates as a result of this merger. We are also committed to not closing any stores, distribution centers or manufacturing facilities as a result of the merger. We are very proud of our ability to make such a commitment, especially at a time when many companies are announcing job cuts. And this is consistent with Kroger's track record in recent mergers.\nWe remain incredibly excited about our future together with Albertsons. We are confident that as many of our stakeholders learn about Kroger's history of growth through mergers, they will understand the meaningful and measurable benefits this will have for our customers, associates and communities.\nWe are proud of the results our team delivered while navigating a challenged environment. We are focused on delivering lower prices and more choices to our customers than ever before. Our value proposition is growing households and customer trips, which positions us well for long-term growth. We are confident that we have the right strategy. The strength of our value creation model positions us well to continue investing in our business, our customers and our associates, which powers our ability to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.",

If you would like to withdraw your question, you may press star two. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, senior director of investor relations. Please go ahead. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Quast\n\nHead of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements.\nWe want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially.

In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney. [Rodney McMullen] Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\n\nRodney McMullen\n\nI'd like to start by sharing how incredibly optimistic I am about Kroger's future. Our performance last year demonstrates how Kroger is consistently delivering for our customers, our associates, and our communities, and by doing so, creating value for our shareholders.\nSince announcing our leading with fresh and accelerating with digital strategy at our 2020 Investor Day, we have made tremendous progress against our commitments. As you will see from the chart on Slide 6 of the presentation deck Rob mentioned, we are delivering a fresh, affordable, and seamless shopping experience for our customers with zero compromise on value, quality, selection, or convenience. We are advancing our purpose to feed the human spirit by significantly increasing associate wages and uplifting our communities. And we are delivering on our financial commitments through our strong, resilient, value creation model. With this strategy, we exceeded our financial goals and delivered attractive total shareholder returns during the past two years.\nIn 2022, customer preferences shifted in response to inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers were looking for more ways to stretch their budget. The gap between food at home and food away from home spending grew in the fourth quarter as more customers gravitated toward affordable meal solutions that restaurants simply can't provide. Our research shows that cooking at home is three to four times less expensive than dining out.\nAnd as Kroger was there for our customers, innovating quickly to meet their needs and wants, our nimble and customer-focused approach helped us deliver strong results in 2022, leading to total household growth and enhanced customer loyalty. We saw an especially strong response in our higher-income households as this segment grew by 1.1 million households, further illustrating the resiliency in our model and strong value proposition we offer customers across all segments. Gary will get into the specific details of our 2022 financial results and outlook for 2023 a little later.\nBefore doing so, I'd like to spend some time reviewing how each pillar of our go-to-market strategy provided meaningful and measurable customer benefits last year and how we will accelerate those benefits in 2023. The foundation of our go-to-market strategy is fresh, our brand, personalization, and seamless. By delivering on these four pillars, our customers win and Kroger attracts new and more loyal customers. At the center of our go-to-market strategy is a superior customer experience.\nWe deliver that by consistently providing customers a full, fresh, and friendly experience. Kroger continued to demonstrate operational excellence in 2022 as we saw improvements in all three metrics. We believe our go-to-market strategy is creating a unique value -- customer value proposition designed to perform in many economic environments. We will continue to invest in our pillars and the customer experience to differentiate the value we offer.\nFirst, leading with fresh. As an important influence on where customers shop, we are constantly improving how we bring even fresher food to our stores and e-commerce experience. Our end-to-end fresh initiative is changing the way our teams deliver on our commitment to freshness, and we are incredibly pleased with the success. In 2022, more than 1,400 stores implemented the end-to-end produce solution, driving measurable increases in both fresh and total store sales.\nIn 2023, we will continue innovating the fresh experience to drive customer satisfaction and improve our product mix. We continue to improve inventory management tools, strengthen our supply chain to deliver additional days of freshness, and enhance our offerings to meet customer demand. As a reminder, our merger with Home Chef brought significant capabilities in in-store and restaurant-quality meal solutions. We will be expanding our Home Chef production facilities to meet this growing customer need.\nNext, Our Brands. There are -- the Our Brands portfolio allows us to offer exciting products at great value while driving incremental sales and improving margins. Our Brands' quality and value proposition is especially important when inflation is affecting so many of our customers' lives. To meet the needs of customers on a budget, we launched a new opening price point product line called Smart Way. By consolidating and simplifying several brands into one, we are making it easier for customers while creating a point of differentiation across the full portfolio. We will continue expanding Our Brands to more categories with innovative product offerings. Our goal is to help every customer find high-quality, affordable products they love, from pantry staples to fresh food to ready-to-eat restaurant-quality meals. Now, I'll move to personalization.\nOur data science teams are using predictive science to serve customers the right products at the right time and at the best value. Because we know our customers so well, we are able to provide recommendations to start their baskets and deliver personalized offers on the products most important to them, saving them time and money and making their lives easier. In return, our customers reward us with their trust and loyalty, consistently ranking us among the best at being able to offer personalized savings and solutions that meet their needs. In 2022, we grew loyalty as our customers more deeply engaged with personalized coupons and fuel rewards.\nAs customers look for more ways to save, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high during the year. Our combined paper and digital coupons helped save our customers more than $1.4 billion on products they need and want. That's on top of our everyday promotions and all the other value we offer. To provide even more value, we launched Boost, the industry's most affordable membership nationwide in July. Early results are exceeding our expectations with incremental engagement and overall household spend. We are evolving Boost with new benefits to further broaden its appeal and create additional customer value.\nIn 2023, we will make significant investments to build out our personalization capabilities, including increasing the use of real-time data to predict customer needs, which will support sales growth during the next three years. Finally, turning to seamless. Seamless is growing in importance among our customers, and we expect it will significantly -- be a significant growth driver over the next several years. We have built a digital platform that offers a seamless shopping experience with zero compromise, allowing customers to shift efforts seamlessly between store, pickup, and delivery solutions.\nAs you'll see on Slide 12, our combination of stores and dedicated fulfillment centers positions Kroger to serve all customer trips, from in-stock shopping to rapid delivery on needed-now items to large stock-up orders. Despite the easing of pandemic-related shopping behaviors that led to a significant increase in online shopping, more and more customers are incorporating e-commerce into their daily permanent routines, recognizing the value and convenience online shopping offers. We expect digital sales will continue to grow at a faster pace than overall food-at-home sales and believe Kroger is well-positioned to deliver double-digit growth in over the next three years. As we work to become the most trusted online grocery destination, we are focused on four key areas that will position us to deliver that growth. We start by providing a compelling Kroger-owned digital destination, where we offer customers exceptional value, personalization, and freshness in a single, easy-to-use online experience. Second, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment, driving trust and loyalty by exceeding expectations for quality and freshness.\nOur delivery approach is unique in the fact that we have a large store network conveniently located close to our customers and large dedicated fulfillment centers designed efficiently to pick large orders. Our dedicated fulfillment centers provide the most reliable experience, the highest in-stock levels, best on-time delivery, and one-of-a-kind white-glove experience with industry-leading net promoter scores.\nKroger delivery customers are more engaged across our entire ecosystem, spending more and shopping with us more often. Looking ahead, we will continue to learn through our customer fulfillment network with a focus on driving profitability and efficiencies to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth while delighting our customers.\nNext, we are focused on reaching new customers and adding more shopping occasions. Our delivery network allows us to offer enhanced service to new customers, and we will also grow our share of wallet by increasing the number of orders customers place with us. Solutions like Kroger Delivery Now, enabled by our vast network of conveniently located stores, can connect customers to fresh groceries and household essentials in as little as 30 minutes. This seamless ecosystem makes any shopping experience simple for our customers.\nFinally, we are driving our profit flywheel and improving margins by reducing our digital cost to serve and growing our alternative profit streams. To accomplish this goal, we are lowering fulfillment costs, building the density of demand and last-mile routing, engaging directly with our third-party vendors, and growing digital retail media. Now, let me share how we are accelerating growth in our model through alternative profits. During the last several years, we invested heavily in technology to transform our business and enter new high-growth and high-return businesses.\nThese businesses contribute meaningfully to our results, with alternative profit businesses achieving $1.2 billion in operating profit in 2022. Kroger Precision Marketing is one of our fastest-growing businesses and is well-positioned to win within the U.S. retail media landscape, which is projected to be a $55 billion industry by 2024. What makes our retail media business special is our ability to help brands achieve a greater return on their media investment.\nFor the fifth year in a row, KPM was recognized as a leader in the retail media space by the Path to Purchase Institute, which collects feedback from those closest to the retail media networks and assessing their effectiveness. KPM was recognized as a leader for many of its capabilities, including maintaining its leadership in targeting and measurement capabilities, a testament to the strength of our unique product offerings and the insights we bring to this emerging landscape. Our associates enable our success, and we are committed to investing in theirs. To remain an employer of choice, we support our associates' development and holistic well-being.\nWe provide our associates with the tools they need to grow their careers that they want at all stages. In 2022, Kroger was named as a best place to work in IT for the fifth consecutive year and a best place to work for disability inclusion for the third year. We also continue to support our associates through investments in wages and comprehensive benefits. In 2022, we raised our average hourly rates by more than 6% and has now invested an incremental $1.9 billion in associate wages since 2018.\nOur average hourly rate is now more than $18 and more than $23 when you include comprehensive benefits. We are committed to sustainably increasing associate wages and plan to invest more than $770 million in associates in 2023. We value and respect our associates, and investing in their success is just one way we demonstrate that. We take seriously our role in helping to create a healthier and thriving neighborhoods across the country. The centerpiece of our efforts is Kroger's Zero Hunger, Zero Waste social impact plan, an industry-leading commitment to build communities free from hunger and waste.\nSince launching Zero Hunger, Zero Waste, we have made continual progress toward our goals. We have directed more than $1.65 billion in food and funds to help end hunger, including donating more than 2.3 billion meals. We are making progress on our carbon emissions reduction plan and Our Brands' sustainable packaging goal. I'm especially proud of our incredible associates who helped us reach a key milestone this year with 100% execution of our surplus food rescue programs across each and every store across the company. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus our efforts on our ambitious goal of ending hunger in our communities and eliminating waste, especially food waste, throughout the company.\nIn summary, our proven go-to-market strategy led to enhanced loyalty and household growth as we help customers manage the effect of inflation in 2022. We are well-positioned to sustain our momentum into 2023. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our results and expectations for 2023. Gary.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nChief Executive Officer-Kroger Personal Finance & Corporate Strategy Integration Lead, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into our 2022 results and sharing our outlook for 2023, I'd like to take a step back and remind you how Kroger's value creation model is enabling the company to deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe our value creation model has been a key to delivering consistently strong results over the past four years and is positioning Kroger for growth in years to come. The go-to-market strategy that Rodney outlined earlier is the foundation of our model.\nOver recent years, we have invested significantly in our people, our customers, and technology to create a leading omnichannel position in food retail. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we win customers in our core supermarket business, including health and fuel, and drive significant customer traffic and data into our ecosystem. This, in turn, allows us to deploy our investments in technology and 84.51 to deliver even greater value for customers and create new high-growth, high-margin alternative profit businesses. The value generated from these businesses enables us to reinvest back into our supermarkets and drive further store and digital traffic, creating a flywheel effect.\nWe are evolving from a traditional food retailer into a more diverse food-first business that we believe can deliver sustainable future growth and succeed in a variety of operating environments. As a reminder, since introducing this model in 2019, we have achieved consistent returns for our shareholders that have significantly exceeded our TSR commitment of 8% to 11%. As you can see in table -- the table on Slide 19, over the past three years, Kroger has achieved more than 19% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted FIFO net operating profit and approximately 25% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted EPS. Over the same time period, we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $9.7 billion and have returned a total of nearly $5.8 billion to investors via dividends and buybacks.\nOverall, we have delivered nearly three times the expected return from our TSR model over this three-year period. Importantly, at the same time, we continue to invest in the business to support future growth. This included improving our price position relative to key competitors since the start of the pandemic, increasing associate wages and benefits by 34% since 2018, and increasing the amount of capital investments allocated to technology and digital capabilities to enable top-line growth and margin expansion. Our strong performance and progress with our model in recent years also gave us the financial flexibility and confidence to announce our proposed merger with Albertsons. Upon closing, which is anticipated to be in early 2024, we believe the merger will significantly accelerate our go-to-market strategy and deliver TSR well above our stand-alone model during the first four years post-close.\n I'll now walk through our full year 2022 financial results. Kroger delivered adjusted EPS of $4.23 per diluted share, an increase of 15%. We achieved identical sales, excluding fuel, of 5.6%.\nThe FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 9 basis points. This reflects the outstanding work of our merchandising and sourcing teams who are extremely effective in managing higher product cost inflation while maintaining competitive prices and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 19 basis points, reflecting sales leverage and cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by planned investments in associates. And I'm delighted to say for the fifth consecutive year, we delivered cost savings of $1 billion in 2022.\nOur adjusted FIFO operating profit was $5.1 billion, an increase of 18% from last year, and the LIFO charge for the full year was $626 million, compared to $197 million in 2021. Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter, an increase of almost 9%. We saw continued momentum in our identical sales, without fuel, of 6.2%.\nUnderlying growth would have been 6.7% after adjusting for the effect of express grips. Our brands contributed another strong quarter with identical sales of 10.1% reflecting the growing importance to customers of these exclusive to Kroger products. and digital sales also accelerated during the quarter of 12%, led by 22% growth in delivery solutions. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel decreased 1 basis point and the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items decreased 56 basis points.\nFuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition. Our loyalty program, which can save customers up to $1.25 per gallon, has been one of the many ways we have helped customers stretch their dollars over the past year and contributed to our gallon sales outpacing the industry during the quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $3.39, compared to $3.30 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.51, compared to $0.44 in the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.27 billion, a year-over-year increase of 26%. And the LIFO charge was $234 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery. This compares to a charge of only $20 million in Q4 last year. Included in our fourth quarter results was a $164 million goodwill and fixed asset impairment charge related to Vitacost.com.\nThe talent and capabilities gained through the merger with Vitacost in 2014 have been key to advancing Kroger's digital platform and growing our digital business to more than $10 billion in annual sales. As our digital strategy has evolved, our primary focus looking forward will be to effectively utilize Kroger's store pickup and delivery capabilities, and this reprioritization resulted in the impairment charge. Vitacost.com will continue to operate as an online platform, providing great value, natural, organic, and eco-friendly products for our customers. Adjusted free cash flow for the year came in $800 million lower than anticipated.\nThis was entirely due to movements in working capital towards the end of the year. The course was a combination of factors, including higher inflation affecting inventory, some forward buying to protect margins and timing of accounts payable and third-party receivable payments around the year-end. As shared last quarter, we feel comfortable with our overall level and mix of inventory, which is higher due to heightened levels of inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels. Looking over a five-year time horizon and smoothing the volatility in working capital experience during the pandemic, we have seen an underlying benefit from working capital over this time period and we would expect to see further improvement going forward.\nWe remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow and, as shared in our guidance this morning, expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2023. Turning now to financial strategy and capital allocation. We will continue to be disciplined with our capital investments, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. As you saw in our guidance this morning, we are anticipating capital investments of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion this year, which is consistent with our long-range TSR model.\nOur priorities for 2023 are aligned with our value creation model and are expected to drive future sales growth and margin expansion. To drive sales, our focus is on enhancing our store and digital ecosystem. We apply a data-driven approach to make decisions on a store-by-store basis, prioritizing store formats and locations with the highest growth potential. Additionally, we are continually enhancing our seamless experience, including investing in technology to improve the customer proposition and augmenting personalization, which will in turn create additional alternative profit opportunities.\nWe continue to invest in areas of the business that will drive operating margin expansion, including enhancements to our supply chain capabilities. These investments help improve margins and differentiate our fresh offering. And finally, an essential element of our value creation model has been our ability to take cost out of our business. We remain focused on eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience, and we are making investments in technology to improve store productivity, lower digital fulfillment costs, and reduce waste and shrink.\nThese improvements will drive an incremental $1 billion of cost savings in 2023, which would mark our sixth year in a row of delivering $1 billion of savings. In closing, I'd like to share some additional color on our expectations for 2023. While there is still uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, our go-to-market strategy is resonating with customers, and we believe our successful value creation model positions us well to navigate evolving market conditions. Before I go into the details of our 2023 guidance, there are a couple of unusual factors that I'd like to highlight.\nFirst, Kroger's decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts in December of 2022 is expected to have a negative impact of 150 basis points on identical sales, without fuel. This decision is not expected to have a material effect on profitability. Second, 2023 will include a 53rd week. We expect the effect of this extra week add approximately $0.15 to our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the year.\nWith that important context, we expect to achieve identical sales, without fuel, of 1% to 2% in 2023. Excluding the effect of Express Scripts, our underlying identical sales, without fuel growth, is expected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. We expect to achieve adjusted FIFO operating profit of between $5 billion and $5.2 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of between $4.45 and $4.60, including the expected benefit of the 53rd week. We expect to grow revenue by continuing to invest in our customers through competitive pricing and personalization and providing fresh products and a better shopping experience across our store and digital ecosystem.\nWe will fund investments in gross margin in 2023 by improving our product mix as we accelerate momentum with our fresh and Our Brands initiatives and by growing our alternative profit businesses. As Rodney mentioned earlier, we will also continue to invest significantly in associate wages, and this will be funded by our planned cost-saving initiatives. While we believe fuel margins will remain structurally higher than historical averages, fuel profitability is expected to be a headwind to our model in 2023 as we lap historic fuel margins from last year. Our 2023 guidance assumes a LIFO charge of between $300 million to $350 million as a result of lower product cost inflation compared to 2022.\nWhile this amount is well above historical levels, LIFO is expected to be a year-over-year tailwind and should more than offset lower fuel profitability. In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales, without fuel, to be above the top end of our guidance range in the first half of the year as we continue to experience heightened levels of inflation. In the second half of the year, we expect identical sales, without fuel, to be at or slightly below the bottom end of our range as we expect inflation to taper later in the year. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share in Quarter 1 will be slightly negative year over year as we cycle 22% growth in EPS from Q1 last year.\nQuarter 2 and Quarter 3 are expected to be within our annual guidance range, and Quarter 4 is expected to be above our guidance range as we cycle the higher LIFO charge in '22 and benefit from the 53rd week. As you heard from Rodney and myself this morning, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and the investments that we have made in our go-to-market strategy provide exciting opportunities for future growth. Our team is energized by these opportunities, and we believe Kroger is well-positioned to continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. \n\nMultiple\n\n[Gary Millerchip] I'll now turn the call back over to Rodney. [Rodney McMullen] Thanks, Gary. Before we open up the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with Albertsons.\n\nRodney McMullen\n\nDuring the past few months, we've spent time getting to know Vivek and the Albertsons leadership team. We are incredibly impressed with their talent, culture, and commitment to their customers and communities.\nWe look forward to bringing together our two highly complementary organizations to provide customers with lower prices and more choices while realizing the long-term value we expect this merger will deliver. We are working cooperatively with regulators responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request and in discussions about the transaction while also working to identify potential buyers for the stores we expect to divest to obtain clearance for the transaction. We are pleased with the level of interest received thus far, and we'll work toward finding a solution that benefits all stakeholders. We remain on track to close the transaction in early 2024.\nDuring the quarter, we launched our integration planning efforts with the goal of preparing for a seamless cultural and operational integration. We expect to create customer benefits beginning day one post-close. The integration team is developing workstreams with clear objectives and milestones to deliver value for our customers, associates, communities, and shareholders. We are pleased with the progress we've made to date and will continue to provide updates as we have them.\nWe achieved exceptional results in 2022, building on our record years in 2020 and 2021, and we exceeded our commitments in our leading with fresh, accelerating with digital strategy. Our strategy of focusing on our customers, our associates, and our communities is working. Our customers are telling us that we're doing a better job serving their needs. We continue to improve our associates' wages and comprehensive benefits with a 34% increase in the last five years. And we are helping to create healthier, thriving communities through our Zero Hunger, Zero Waste work. We believe our momentum is sustainable and will only accelerate upon the completion of our pending merger with Albertsons. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.",

Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.\nThe Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information.\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong results. powered by our strategy of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. Our associates continue to create a seamless customer experience, delivering fresh and affordable food anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience.\nOur associates' incredible dedication means we have momentum entering the fourth quarter and we are continuing to consistently deliver a full fresh and friendly experience for our customers throughout the busy holiday season. It is clear that inflation remains top of mind for our customers and for our company. We are laser focused on helping our customers by providing fresh and affordable food.\nResearch shows cooking at home is still 3x to 4x less expensive than dining out. And we are seeing more customers engage with our brands as a way to stretch their food budgets without compromising on quality. During the quarter, we continue to see many of the same shopping trends we observed throughout the year.\nIn addition to higher engagement with our brands products, Customers are downloading and redeeming digital coupons and continuing to showcase their cooking at home skills learned during the pandemic. Our breadth of choices, quality of fresh products and the value of our personalized promotions are helping customers navigate the current environment, and our customer-focused approach is working.\nWe continue to see overall household growth and significant loyal household growth, which drives a meaningful portion of our sales volume. We are proud to serve as America's grocer, especially during the holiday season. As friends and family come together, we look forward to providing our customers the perfect ingredients to create cherished memories. At a time when 48% of customers have told us they plan to cut back on their Thanksgiving celebration due to inflation. We took action and made sure Thanksgiving was enjoyable and memorable for everyone. To do that, we introduced an easy guide for customers to build an affordable meal of our brand's products with all of the Thanksgiving favorites that a family could enjoy for as little as $5 a person. This is just one example of how we create amazing quality at a great price when it matters most to our customers.\nWe empower our customers to create lasting food memories by consistently executing against our go-to-market strategy, focused on Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and our seamless ecosystem. Fresh remains important in today's environment, and we are committed to bringing the freshest products to our customers' tables. Our Fresh for Everyone strategy is grounded in keeping products fresher, longer. Our end-to-end Fresh initiative is transforming these efforts. At the end of quarter 3, we have a total of 1,252 certified stores. At these locations, we see higher fresh sales and identical store sales. With these impressive results, we continue to roll out the initiative nationwide. As part of our end-to-end fresh initiative is our supply chain, where we continue to invest and enhance operations. We are improving productivity and maximizing our fleet by controlling more product movement across our network. Most importantly, we are using our data and science to maximize freshness for our customers.\nBeyond our end-to-end Fresh program, we are bringing more Fresh products to our customers. During the quarter, Home Chef launched new plant-based ready-to-cook meals. They also collaborated with Kroger's in-house dieticians to launch our new simple and nutritious healthy meal kits. Home Chef continues to be an exceptional example of how Kroger's history of mergers help bring new and exciting capabilities to meet our customers' changing needs across the country.\nTurning to Our Brands. We delivered another strong quarter in Our Brands with identical sales growth that outpaced overall identical sales. This was led by our Kroger and Private Selection brands. Customers continue to engage with the Our Brands portfolio, which offers high-quality products at affordable prices. Our Brands products are loved by every member of the family, including the pets. This quarter, we saw tremendous growth in our pet food brands as families continue to treat their dogs and their cats. As you know, they're like a member of the family. We continue to expand and diversify Our Brands portfolio at every price point. After launching Smart Way as our opening price point brand last quarter, we introduced several new Smart Way products this quarter and plan to roll out additional products next quarter. These products are meeting the needs of our customers on a budget, and we've already seen 2 million households to purchase Smart Way products.\nIn regard to personalization, our customers are looking for opportunities to save on the products they love. Our loyalty programs and personalized promotions allow them to do just that. We continue to use our leading data science capabilities to develop unique customer insights and offer targeted promotions on the products we know they love. This strategy is driving digital engagement with digital coupon downloads, 32% higher than last year. We anticipate these interactions will continue through the holidays with customers expected to realize more than $200 million in savings from our highly personalized digital offers.\nMoving on to Seamless. We're improving our Seamless experience that brings our customers fresh products anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience. We saw back-to-back quarters of strong digital growth led by our delivery solutions. This quarter, we introduced app enhancements that make it easier for customers to engage with our savings and promotion. We launched our first in-app flash sales and enabled our customers to clip digital offers directly from their cart.\nImproving the customer experience is always top of mind for us, and Kroger Pickup now offers 3-hour pickup lead times at all stores in our network, with as little as 1 hour lead time in some areas. We're investing in digital growth initiatives, including expanding our Kroger delivery network in new and existing geographies. We are also growing Boost, our one-of-the-kind membership program. This is the industry's most affordable membership program, and it is foundational to growing our delivery service. We are incredibly pleased with our customer response to Boost as we rolled out the program nationwide earlier this year.\nWe continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy. In addition to investing in average hourly rates this quarter, we enhanced the benefits available to our associates. We expanded the eligibility for our 401(k) plan participants to encourage earlier commitments to lifelong savings, and we took steps to continue supporting working parents by increasing family lead time and our company-sponsored benefit plans. We are excited to celebrate amazing associates this quarter, who were recognized for their outstanding work and commitment to our customers. We were the most recognized employer for Progressive Grocer's GenNext honorees, with 28 of our young leaders recognized for driving change and innovation, both within the organizations and communities they serve.\nAdditionally, our KEPASA Hispanic and Latino Associate Resource Group was honored by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce as the Employee Resource Group of the Year.\nIn summary, we are building momentum as we close out the year. We are excited to surprise and delight our customers this holiday season with high-quality fresh products at affordable prices. allowing customers to serve on the items that matter most.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to cover our financial results. Gary?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nSenior VP & CFO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's relentless focus on delivering value for our customers was the foundation of our strong results in quarter 3. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy is resonating the shoppers and driving increased customer loyalty. We were especially pleased with the balance achieved in our results this quarter as we continue to invest in our customers and associates, while also effectively managing costs to achieve solid earnings growth.\nThese results provide yet another proof point of the strength of our value creation model and our ability to operate successfully in different environments.\nI'll now provide additional color on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.88 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was driven by top line revenue and our disciplined approach to balancing investments with effective cost management.\nIdentical sales without fuel grew 6.9%. Our Brands continue to resonate deeply with customers as sales grew 10.4%. The outstanding quality and value offered by these exclusive Kroger products is an important differentiator in our go-to-market strategy, and this is especially true during periods of high inflation. As we shared at our Investor Day in March, Our Brands products are margin accretive and represent a key pillar in our strategy to grow profitability while also delivering greater value for customers.\nDigital sales grew 10% during the quarter with delivery solutions leading the way, up 34% year-over-year. Delivery solutions includes the Kroger delivery network powered by Ocado delivery from our stores via Kroger and third-party platforms and our convenience offering, Kroger Delivery Now. Our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores in Kroger Delivery are driving new customer engagement and best-in-class retention rates.\nGross margin was 21.4% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 5 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our team's ability to effectively manage higher product cost inflation and shrink through strong sourcing practices while also helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive.\nDuring the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $152 million compared to $93 million in the prior year. This was primarily driven by higher product cost inflation in grocery. We still expect to see some moderation in inflation during our fourth quarter as we cycle higher inflation from a year ago.\nKroger's operating general and administrative rates decreased 3 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. The decrease in OG&A rate was driven by sales leverage and execution of cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by investments in our associates. We continue to identify opportunities to remove cost from our business without affecting the customer experience and are on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.\nKroger Health had another successful quarter, delivering higher-than-expected sales and profitability despite cycling the impact of higher COVID vaccine revenue from a year ago. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in health care, and our Kroger Health team remains committed to ensuring our customers obtain medically necessary prescriptions.\nRecently, we announced that we are terminating our Express Scripts agreement for commercial customers as of December 31. The Express Scripts contract would have required Kroger to fill our customers' prescriptions below our cost of operation, something we could not accept as we aim to keep our prices low for customers during this inflationary period. We expect this contract termination will reduce sales by about $100 million in Kroger's fiscal fourth quarter, impacting identical sales without fuel for the quarter by approximately 35 basis points. This decision is not expected to have an impact on operating profit or EPS.\nIncluded in our results for the quarter is an $85 million pretax charge related to the settlement of all opioid litigation claims with the State of New Mexico. This amount was excluded from our adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS results to reflect the unique and nonrecurring nature of the charge. This settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability by Kroger, and we will continue to vigorously defend against other claims and lawsuits related to opioids.\nThis settlement is based on a unique set of circumstances and facts related to New Mexico, and Kroger does not believe that the settlement amount or any other terms of our agreement with New Mexico can or should be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases pending against Kroger. It is our view that this settlement is not a reliable proxy for the outcome of any other cases or the overall level of Kroger's exposure.\nCurrently, Kroger has 2 active matters pending in West Virginia and Texas scheduled for trial in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Kroger continues to believe that the claims are without merit, and that it has strong defenses to these claims. Kroger is also differently situated from many of the other defendants in these cases. Our pharmacy operations have a much smaller footprint, both in terms of the size of the business, and market share with respect to opioids, and we are proud of the outstanding work performed by our associates in delivering critical care and services to our pharmacy customers.\nTurning now to alternative profit businesses, which are a fast-growing and key part of our value creation model. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continues to create a flywheel effect for alternative profits and growth this quarter was again led by retail media. CPG brands are finding significant value in our unique ability to build custom audiences that draw on our data to deliver precisely measured return on investment.\nLast month, KPM added a new channel to its suite of retail media solutions, welcoming Snapchat into the portfolio. Advertisers are now able to use Kroger's proprietary capabilities to optimize Snapchat's immersive ad formats. We are constantly innovating to expand our reach, and KPM recently increased its programmatic advertising marketplace capabilities to include video and one of the fastest-growing digital media sectors, connected TV. These new frontiers will provide exciting future growth opportunities for KPN.\nFuel is an important part of our overall value proposition, and our fuel rewards program remains a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars during a period of high inflation. Fuel rewards engagement remained high during the third quarter and led to gallon sales, which outpaced the market. The average retail fuel price was $3.84 this quarter, versus $3.24 in the same quarter last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.50 compared to $0.42 in the same quarter in 2021.\nThe results we reported today would not have been possible without our incredible associates who continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and delivering a full, fresh and friendly experience for our customers. We have a long track record of investing in our associates and are committed to continuing these investments to ensure Kroger remains an employer of choice. Building on $1.2 billion of incremental investments since 2018 we have raised our average hourly rates by over 5% so far in 2022.\nDuring the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Columbus, Las Vegas, Chicago, Fort Wayne and pharmacists in Southern California, covering more than 28,000 associates. During the fourth quarter, we have also ratified new labor agreements for associates in Toledo and Nashville, as well as the Teamsters master agreement.\nTurning now to cash flow and liquidity. During the quarter, cash flow was affected by increased inventory balances. This was predominantly due to higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery, in stocks improving to pre-pandemic levels and forward buying of inventory in pharmacy. We are comfortable that our current level and mix of inventory is appropriate to support our future sales expectations and would expect to see an improvement in working capital during the fourth quarter.\nRegarding capital expenditures, we are committed to investing in the business to support our go-to-market strategy and continue to see many opportunities to drive future growth. As shared last quarter, various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints, and we now expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2022.\nThe net effect of higher inventory and lower capital expenditures for the year is that we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2022.\nIn closing, I'd like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy continues to build momentum in our business and gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 5.1% to 5.3%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.15, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2021.\nThis guidance assumes a LIFO charge of approximately $500 million for the full year, which represents a $300 million headwind over the 2021 LIFO charge. Our third quarter and year-to-date results highlight the strength of Kroger's value creation model, which has proven to be resilient in different operating environments. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns, and we look forward to sharing detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in March.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Gary. The results we've shared with you today are a testament to our business model strength and agility to support our customers in all economic environments. This is made possible because of the hard work and dedication of our incredible associates. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons. As you may know, I had the opportunity and Vivek did as well to testify before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights this week. I shared with the senators that our merger will lower prices for customers starting day 1, continued investments in our associates and stores and customer experience and do even more in our communities than either company can do alone. We believe this merger will allow us to fulfill these commitments to our customers, our associates and our communities well into the future.\nWe are making early progress on our integration planning as expected and we continue to engage with all of our stakeholders and regulators. We are advancing our road map to close the transaction in early 2024. We look forward to working with the regulators as they review the transaction and do not have a substantial update at this time. We would ask that you focus your questions on our quarterly performance and our progress on our strategy.\nWith that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions.",

Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alex, and I'll be coordinating the call today. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nThe Kroger team delivered another strong performance during the quarter, fueled by our strategy Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. These consistent results underscore the resiliency and flexibility of our business model, along with our associates' passion to deliver a fresh, convenient customer experience with 0 compromise on quality, selection and affordability.\nCustomers continue to adjust their shopping habits in response to ongoing inflation. We are doing everything we can to help our customers stretch their dollars with high-quality fresh products at everyday low prices and industry-leading fuel rewards program and personalized savings on the items that matter most to them. Our customers are looking for ways to save and we are there for them.\nDuring the quarter, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high with 750 million digital offers downloaded, totaling almost $1 billion in savings. Our fuel rewards program continues to resonate with customers as more than 600,000 incremental households engaged with our fuel rewards program this quarter compared to last year. And our fuel reward redemption rates were also up significantly.\nWe continue to see more customers cooking from scratch and eating out less often. Our broad assortment of products is meeting the need for customers to buy what they want on their terms. For example, some customers are continuing to buy more of their favorite fresh products like apples, tomatoes and grapes. While other customers are choosing products like frozen fruit and vegetables, allowing products to last longer in their homes. Overall, customers are looking to save money and make healthier choices by cooking more meals at home rather than eating out. Kroger's strong value proposition drove positive household growth and meaningful (inaudible) household growth both online and in-store.\nDigital sales also returned to positive growth, driven by our one-of-a-kind boost membership program and expansion of our Kroger delivery network. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is connecting with customers, and we continue to build long-term customer loyalty through Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and our Seamless ecosystem.\nLeading with Fresh, we are dedicated to serving our customers the freshest products so when they think food, they think Kroger. To achieve this goal, we are utilizing technology and deploying fresh innovation to deliver products faster, which stay fresher longer for our customers to enjoy. And it's working. In our 864 fresh certified stores, customers are purchasing more fresh products and overall store sales are growing faster than the rest of the business. Supply chain remains an important part of our fresh strategy as well. In order to maximize freshness, we are utilizing our data science and collaborating with our partners to minimize [dwell] time in our distribution network and maintain the integrity of the cold chain. We are also improving productivity in our supply chain.\nDuring the quarter, we reduced fuel cost headwinds through technology and process efficiencies, such as controlling more product movement across the value chain and maximizing our trucking capacity. While some categories remain challenging, supplier in-stocks are improving, and we are cautiously optimistic this will continue in the back half of the year.\nTurning to Our Brands. We saw incredible engagement in Our Brands during the quarter with identical sales growth of 10.2% compared to last year. This increase was led by our Kroger and Home Chef brands. Convenience remains a priority and Home Chef is meeting that need by providing high-quality family meals as a budget-friendly alternative to eating out at restaurants.\nFor other customers who are enjoying cooking from scratch, Our Brands are delivering innovative products at a great value. So Our Brands' product strategy is rooted in quality, providing customers with memorable meal experiences they crave. And these products continue to earn world-class recognition. Most recently, Murray's Cheese varieties won five awards at the highly regarded 2022 American Cheese Society Competition. We were also recognized by Store Brands Magazine with 12 Editors' Picks awards for best new products, the most of any retailer. This recognition focused specifically on food that met customer needs for healthier products.\nAs we continue to look for ways to help our customers stretch their budgets, this quarter, we launched a new portfolio strategy for our opening price point brands. We consolidated 17 legacy brands into 2. Heritage Farm for our fresh and dairy product lines; and our newest brand, Smart Way for our nonperishable items. These brands are competitively priced and meet the needs of customers on a (inaudible) budget. We launched with 150 SKUs and expect to roll out additional products by the end of the year.\nNow moving to digital. We achieved positive sales growth, as I mentioned before, led by our strong delivery results. Early in the second quarter, we introduced our Boost membership nationwide, and it's already showing promising results including an increase in overall household spend among members. We remain focused on adding new members and are encouraged that enrollment is in line with our internal expectations and projections.\nDuring the quarter, we opened a new Customer Fulfillment Center powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform in Romulus, Michigan. Additionally, we are excited to expand the Kroger delivery network to more customers in four new geographies during the quarter through spoke facilities in Austin, Birmingham, Oklahoma City and San Antonio. This brings our total CFC and spoke count to 18.\nWe also continue to invest in our pickup business, where demand remains strong. During the quarter, we increased capacity and shortened wait times to improve our customer experience. We also invested in technology and implemented process efficiencies, which helped lower our cost to serve.\nOur customers are telling us they love our Seamless experience. We continue to see customers effortlessly shift between store, pickup and delivery, which is building loyalty. We continue to improve the experience. And we'll always encourage our customers to shop with us how they want to and with 0 compromises.\nOur associate dedication and passion continue to fuel Kroger's consistently strong results, and we are proud to invest in our teams and improve the associate experience. We saw more people apply to work at Kroger this quarter as we continue to attract talented associates.\nOur current associates, we are making progress on retention. We've rolled out improved onboarding guidelines and implemented career planning tools. In addition, as part of our commitment to associate wellness, we recently introduced a new financial coaching service tool for hourly associates. This unique benefit offers free financial planning assistance to our associates. We are launching the tool in three pilot divisions and look forward to expanding the service across the company by January of 2023.\nIt is always exciting to see our associates' commitment to creating an outstanding work environment recognized. For the third consecutive year, Kroger was named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equity Index. Additionally, the Brandon Hall Group, a leading human capital management firm, honored Kroger for our training programs and the ways in which our teams promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Each team member is involved in creating our culture where associates come for a job and discover a career.\nOur Purpose: to Feed the Human Spirit inspires our team every day. One important way we bring our purpose to life is through Kroger's comprehensive ESG strategy. Our aim is to achieve lasting positive change for people and our planet. Our newly published 2022 ESG report called Nurturing Shared Values, outlines the entire Kroger family strong progress against dozens of environmental sustainability, social impact and governance goals and commitments.\nWe continued working to operationalize and integrate ESG within our business. Nowhere is this more evident than through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. This month marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. And while we still have much -- so much more work to do to achieve our moonshot goal of achieving a world free from hunger and food waste, we also have so much to celebrate. Over the past 5 years, our team donated 2.3 billion meals to our neighbors in need, which included $1 billion in giving to fight food and security, 500 million pounds of surplus food donated to our food bank partners and nearly $45 million in grants to support food recovery and system change from our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. And I'm very proud to share for the first time ever, our store teams achieved 100% execution of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue, which is the strongest proof point yet of the value of operationalizing ESG. It took all of our teams working cross-functionally to achieve this important milestone. A huge congratulations and thank you to all involved.\nIn summary, Kroger delivered another strong second quarter. We continue to delight our customers, strengthen our business model and execute on our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. We remain focused on delivering for our associates, customers and communities. And when we do that well, deliver value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our second quarter financials. Gary?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nSenior VP & CFO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.\nThe Kroger team is laser-focused on executing our go-to-market strategy, which we outlined at our Investor Day in March. Our balanced business model has proven to be resilient in a variety of operating and economic environments, and our second quarter performance provided another proof point of this as we delivered significant year-over-year growth.\nI'll now provide additional color on our second quarter results. We achieved strong identical sales growth without fuel of 5.8% and saw momentum build throughout the quarter. Our Brands led the way with identical sales growing 10.2%. We believe the unmatched combination of innovation, quality and value provided by Our Brands is a clear competitive advantage as inflation remains front of mind for many of our customers.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year and ahead of our internal expectations. These results were driven by increased sales of our fuel, disciplined margin management and strong fuel profitability.\nOur seamless digital ecosystem is critical to building deeper customer loyalty and accelerating market share growth. During the quarter, digital sales grew 8%, led by strength in delivery solutions, which grew by 34%. We continue to invest in digital growth initiatives, including the expansion of our Kroger Delivery network in new and existing geographies, investments in the customer value proposition via Kroger Boost membership and the expansion of customer trip missions, including meal solutions and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our positive momentum in digital sales will continue in the second half of the year.\nKroger Health also contributed meaningfully to our second quarter results as we grew the profitability of our core pharmacy business. This allowed us to cycle the impact of higher COVID-19 vaccine revenue from a year ago, which is especially impressive given the number of [vaccinations] administered last year.\nGross margin was 20.9% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost inflation through strong sourcing practices while helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive.\nOur team is doing an outstanding job navigating the current inflationary environment. We are experiencing the benefits of a multiyear journey in enterprise sourcing that is delivering significant and sustainable savings for Kroger and our customers. Our personalized pricing strategy is enabling us to maximize the reach and effectiveness of our promotional investments to drive loyalty and deliver value for our customers in ways they value most. Together, this has enabled Kroger to improve our price position relative to our key competitors.\nDue to continued heightened levels of product cost inflation, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $148 million compared to $47 million in the prior year. We expect inflation will remain at heightened levels in the second half of the year but moderate on a year-over-year basis as we start to cycle the higher inflation, which began in the third quarter last year.\nKroger's OG&A rate increased 36 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in associates, higher incentive plan costs and strategic investments in various margin expansion initiatives, partly offset by sales leverage and continued execution of cost savings.\nWe continue to identify opportunities to remove costs from our business without affecting the customer experience and they're on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, the increase in our OG&A rate during the quarter was unusual as it included an accrual catch-up for higher projected incentive costs covering the first half of the year, as well as strategic investments in a number of margin expansion initiatives that will drive future growth. We would expect to achieve year-over-year improvements in our OG&A rate in the second half of the year and for the full year.\nTurning now to alternative profits. Kroger Precision Marketing continues to increase its relevance with our CPG partners. During the quarter, we saw an increase in brand reinvestment rates as CPGs experienced strong returns on their marketing spend with KPM. Kroger Personal Finance products and services are also connecting well with customers in the current environment, providing even more ways to save. This includes our KPF credit card featuring an introductory $0.55 off per gallon of fuel and our gift card program, which promotionally offers 4x fuel rewards.\nFuel remains an important part of our business model and delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our fuel rewards program is a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers engage with our fuel rewards program at the highest rate since the start of the pandemic during the second quarter, and this helped to ensure our gallon sales outpace the market.\nThe average retail fuel price was $4.62 this quarter compared to $3.13 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.62 compared to $0.39 in the same quarter in 2021. The strength of our fuel results is a great example of the flexibility that exists within our business model as higher fuel profit fully offset the higher LIFO charge in the quarter and allowed us to reinvest strategically in a number of margin expansion initiatives.\nOur associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers, and we are investing in hourly wages to ensure Kroger remains an employee of choice. We're also committed to continuing to invest in our associates and sustainably growing hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our long-term financial model.\nDuring the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Houston, Memphis, Lake Charles, Shreveport, Las Vegas Clarkson and Meat, Southern California [Clarkson Meats] and Indianapolis, covering more than 40,000 associates. In the second half, we plan to complete contract negotiations for Chicago, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Toledo, South Bend and Southern California pharmacists.\nTurning now to our financial strategy and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. As a result of our operating performance and working capital improvements over recent years, our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Underlying initiatives to improve working capital also helped offset higher inventory balances during the quarter, which were a function of higher product cost inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe continue to prioritize capital investments that support our go-to-market strategy and see many opportunities to drive future growth. As we updated in our guidance today, we now expect our range for capital investments for 2022 to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion as various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints.\nEarlier this quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 24%, reflecting our confidence in our long-range plans and our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow. The quarterly dividend has grown at a 14% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006. And this marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nDuring the quarter, we also repurchased $309 million of shares and year-to-date, have repurchased $975 million of shares. Earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program.\nI'd now like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution in our go-to-market strategy is building momentum in our business, which combined with sustained food-at-home trends gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 4% to 4.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.95 to $4.05, representing growth of 7% to 10% over 2021. This outlook includes a year-over-year headwind from LIFO of approximately $100 million in the second half of 2022.\nIn closing, we have the right go-to-market strategy and are operating from a position of strength. Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Gary.\nThe Kroger team successfully navigated another quarter in a dynamic operating environment with strong results. As our customers continue to deal with high inflation, our value proposition is resonating with them. And this reflects the balance we've built into our model. We have demonstrated the ability to offer customers fresh, affordable food and the value they need to help them manage their budgets while we continue to invest in our associates, reinvest in our business and consistently generate strong results. Our performance gives us the confidence that we have the right plan in place to build on our momentum and continue delivering value for all stakeholders.\nSo with that, Alex, we'll turn it over for questions.",

My name is Alex, and I'll be coordinating the call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over to your host, Rob Quast, Director of Investor Relations. Over to you, Rob.\n\nRobinson C. Quast\n\nDirector of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rodney McMullen; and our Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information.\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. (Operator Instructions) In response to your feedback on allowing more participants during Q&A, we may provide abbreviated responses to your follow-up questions to hear from as many of you as we can.\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're off to a great start in 2022, delivering strong performance by successfully executing our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. Our associates' relentless focus on providing fresh, affordable food to our customers is driving our strong results.\nDuring the quarter, we demonstrated the resilience of our business model led by strong top line sales ahead of internal expectations. In addition, our team navigated a challenging operating environment characterized by continued inflationary cost pressures and supply chain headwinds, which included higher diesel fuel costs. Through our strategic cost savings execution and sustained food-at-home trends, our team delivered 16% growth in adjusted FIFO operating profit, providing once again the strength of our financial model in a variety of operating environments.\nOur teams are focused on delivering a great customer experience with 0 compromise. Rising inflation, as consumers rethinking their shopping and eating habits, while customers continue to cook more, we are seeing different shopping behaviors based on how individual customers are experiencing the current inflationary environment.\nMany customers continue to shop premium products throughout the store, including Private Selection, Murray's Cheese and deluxe meal solutions. For other customers whose budget are more directly impacted by food and fuel inflation, they are actively looking for ways to save. We're doing everything we can to help this customer stretch their budgets.\nI'd like to share more about the work we're doing for our customers and how our competitive moats uniquely position us to meet these challenging and changing customer needs.\nFirst, we are leading with fresh. Our customers continue to prioritize fresh as the #1 determinant of where to shop. We are meeting their needs with operational efficiencies and new technologies that extend days of freshness and grow our selection of quality fresh products.\nIn the first quarter, we achieved 5.2% identical sales growth in our fresh categories. These gains were led by the expansion of our End-to-End Fresh Produce program, which elevates standards and improves our ability to maintain freshness throughout the supply chain.\nWe certified 355 stores this quarter, and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We also continue to increase our use of forecasting and analytical tools, specifically leveraging 84.51° to improve our ability to maintain fresh products in stock, both in store and online.\nOur recent floral results are a great example of how we are leading with fresh. As the nation's largest florist, the first quarter was our time to shine for holiday celebrations and our floral team stepped up, achieving record sales. In fact, we set an overall single-day floral sales record on Valentine's Day and a Mother's Day sales record with strong double-digit growth.\nSecond is Our Brands. During the quarter, we saw tremendous growth in Our Brands, which had identical sales of 6.3% and outpaced all national brands. With 92% of households purchasing at least one of these products, we launched 239 new and innovative products during the quarter, reflecting many of the top food trend predictions we made at the beginning of the year. All of our new products continue to be tested and validated to ensure that they are as good or better than the comparable national brand. We continue to invest heavily in the quality of Our Brands, which preserves our strong price position and drives higher profitability.\nNext area is personalization. Our data science platform provides unique insights that creates personalized customer experiences. In this dynamic environment where customer behaviors are changing rapidly, we use our data and insights to be nimble and react quickly to ever-changing needs. Our broad-based data science approach helps us determine how to best implement price, promotion and display.\nWe are focused on delivering incredible value to our customers through relevant personalized offers and fuel rewards. Our loyal customers are using our fuel rewards program now more than ever and, in fact, more than 600,000 incremental households engaged for the first time this quarter.\nFinally, our seamless ecosystem continues to deliver fresh products to our customers anytime, anywhere and with 0 compromise.\nDuring the first quarter, more customers returned to in-store shopping. And as a result, we made strides to enhance that experience while introducing new tools that help our associates better serve customers. In pickup, we unveiled new technology that improved wait times 20% and expanded capacity based on customer needs. In delivery, we continue to introduce key initiatives that expand our reach and shorten delivery times. We strive to provide more customers access to high-quality, affordable food regardless of whether they have a physical store in their community.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 2 new customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform, one in Dallas, Texas and one in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, bringing our total CFC count to 5. We also opened 3 new spoke locations for a total of 6 spokes.\nAs we head into summer, our end-to-end cold solutions, including the custom-built refrigerated van, will ensure customers get the freshest product delivered directly to their doorstep.\nFinally, our Boost membership is delivering promising results. Our one-of-a-kind membership program offers incredible value where customers can get unlimited free delivery on orders of $35 or more, double the fuel points on every dollar spent at Kroger and other exclusive member benefits.\nWe are encouraged by the number of new members in the 4 current pilot divisions. Importantly, delivery sales increased significantly compared to non-Boost divisions and delivery retention improved approximately 600 basis points.\nBecause of this early success, we are proud to announce today that Kroger Boost is launching nationwide beginning in the next few weeks. This next-generation loyalty program is deepening our relationships with customers as they continue to look for value and convenience.\nTurning to supply chain. Our 2022 business plan anticipated ongoing supply chain challenges. By planning ahead and focusing on staffing, technology and process efficiencies, we manage our costs effectively. By owning and operating a portion of our fleet, we better control and manage transportation costs despite diesel fuel cost headwinds.\nWe were also proactive about forward buying and securing capacity for goods, resulting in better vendor rates. Through our supplier relationships, we saw sequential improvement in product availability. We are well positioned to adapt to the evolving environment, and we are cautiously optimistic in a broader supply chain recovery throughout the year.\nWe also continue to invest in our associates and an associate experience that facilitates an amazing customer experience. We firmly believe that exceptional financial and operating performance connects directly to the ways we support and invest in our associates.\nDuring the quarter, we took numerous steps to meet our associates' needs while they delivered for our customers. We continue to invest in associate wages and we expect hourly wages to grow throughout the year.\nWe launched new initiatives to simplify day-to-day work, including the modernized scheduling tool, MyTime. We took steps to improve communication across all of our teams and bring meaningful training to all of our associates no matter where they work. One example of this commitment is the addition of Microsoft Teams Rooms across most of our store locations. This technology improvement will facilitate deeper connections and improve the associate experiences.\nAs an employer of choice, more people are applying to work for Kroger and more associates are choosing to stay with us. While we still have work to do, we experienced a meaningful improvement in both hiring and retention in the months after the Omicron surge. We are also seeing more boomerangs. These are associates who left to work elsewhere and ultimately came back to us. Kroger's strong culture invites associates to come for a job and discover a career. And we're glad that so many value and appreciate our work environment, our culture and the people they work with every day.\nOur winning culture is rooted in living our purpose to feed the human spirit. During the past last year, our teams took significant steps to support our customers and communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan. We introduced a new Kroger and USO co-branded mobile unit to nourish active duty military service members and their families at military bases and USO centers across the country as well as provide community disaster relief. The first of 4 units hit the road in May.\nIn summary, we're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2022. We are widening our competitive moats, creating a shopping experience with 0 compromise, investing where it matters most to our customers and associates and strengthening our purpose in large and small ways every day. When we do all of this well, our teams, our customers and our shareholders all win.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our first quarter results. Gary?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nSenior VP & CFO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger delivered another quarter of strong results as our team did an outstanding job executing our go-to-market strategy while navigating a dynamic operating environment. Our results again highlight the strength and resilience of Kroger's financial model, which allowed us to continue to invest in our associates, deliver fresh, affordable food for our customers and create value for our shareholders.\nI'll now provide more detail on our results in the quarter. Led by our competitive moats, we achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 4.1%. Fresh categories and Our Brands identical sales both outpaced overall company results.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.45, up 22% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by increased sales and exceptional cost management during the quarter.\nDigital sales declined 6% in the first quarter, broadly in line with our expectations. We continue to ramp the digital growth initiatives shared at our Investor Day, including enhanced personalization capabilities, Boost membership, customer fulfillment centers and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we grew digitally engaged households during the quarter, and we would expect digital sales to accelerate as the year progresses.\nGross margin was 21.6% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 26 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs, offset by sourcing benefits and the cycling of a write-down related to a donation of personal protective equipment inventory in the prior year.\nOur team continues to do an excellent job managing higher product cost inflation. We are leveraging our data and sourcing expertise and working closely with our suppliers to help minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers and are using our proprietary data to deliver additional value through personalization.\nOur Brands are also proving to be an important differentiator for our customers in this environment, providing an unmatched combination of great quality and great value.\nWe will continue to leverage these proven and unique capabilities to help our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and maintain a strong value proposition relative to our competitors as we believe inflation will remain front of mind for many of our customers for the remainder of 2022.\nIn recognition of current product cost inflation and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $37 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.06 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2021.\nOur OG&A rate decreased 46 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We were successful in offsetting inflation headwinds in many parts of our business and continued investments in our associate wages by reducing costs in areas that do not impact the customer experience. As an example, this quarter, we introduced a new bakery forecasting tool, which is improving product freshness, reducing waste and, at the same time, simplifying the associate ordering process. We have a strong pipeline of process improvement initiatives and innovative technology-driven solutions that will lower digital fulfillment costs, increase store productivity and reduce waste and shrink.\nFor the fifth consecutive year, we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings in 2022. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continue to create a strong flywheel effect for alternative profits. Led by retail media and Kroger Personal Finance, alternative profits are on track to contribute meaningful growth in 2022.\nDuring the quarter, Kroger Precision Marketing added more than 100 new brand partners. We continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities and have entered into new agreements with 3 leading advertising management platforms, allowing our CPG partners to manage their on-site ad campaigns more effectively.\nFuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. We continue to deliver significant value through our loyalty program, which saves customers up to $1.25 per gallon. As Rodney shared earlier, more customers engaged with fuel rewards this quarter, and our gallons grew at a faster rate than the market.\nThe average retail price of fuel was $4 this quarter versus $2.79 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year.\nOur associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers. we introduced a number of new initiatives to support associates this quarter as well as continuing to invest in hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our guidance and long-term financial model.\nDuring the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW in Denver, Southern California, Houston, Little Rock, Memphis and Seattle, covering more than 67,000 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW in Las Vegas, Southern California for Ralphs pharmacies, Indianapolis, Roanoke, Chicago and Columbus.\nTurning now to cash flow and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.68 compared to 1.79 a year ago. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5.\nConsistent with our financial strategy, we are investing in the business to drive sustainable future earnings growth and continue to expect capital expenditures of between $3.8 billion and $4 billion in 2022.\nDuring quarter 1, we were disciplined in returning cash to shareholders. In total, Kroger returned $819 million via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.\nWe are operating from a position of financial strength and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy excess cash to accelerate our growth model and deliver sustainable total shareholder returns.\nIn closing, let me share additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. While there are a number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic and inflation outlook for the remainder of 2022, Kroger is laser-focused on executing the plans outlined at our Investor Day, and we believe our go-to-market strategy will serve us well in navigating the current environment.\nBased on the strength of our quarter 1 results and sustained food-at-home trends, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 2.5% to 3.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%.\nOur updated guidance assumes inflation will remain at tightened levels for the remainder of the year, although we would expect the year-over-year rate to moderate in the second half of the year as we cycle higher inflation from quarter 3 and quarter 4 2021.\nDue to this higher outlook for inflation, we now expect our LIFO full year charge will be in the range of $300 million compared to $197 million last year. As a reminder, while the actual LIFO charge is calculated at a point in time at the end of our fourth quarter, we recognize the projected charge evenly throughout the year.\nOur guidance also assumes retail fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2022 as we cycle higher CPG margins from 2021.\nOur full year projected tax rate has been lowered from 23% to 22%, primarily due to higher-than-expected tax deductions related to employee stock option exercises.\nOverall, we are extremely pleased with our start to the year, which provides another proof point of the strength of our financial model. And looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained earnings growth and total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Gary. I would like to once again acknowledge and thank our outstanding associates. Their hard work and dedication fuel our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy and our obsession for our customers. We continue finding new ways to help customers stretch their dollars through everyday prices, data-driven promotions, personalized experiences, trusted Our Brand products and a seamless e-commerce platform. We believe this relentless focus on delivering for customers will help us maintain robust sales and drive growth.\nMoving ahead, we remain confident that we have the right strategy to deliver value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\nNow we'll turn to your questions.",

Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Quast\n\nHead of IR, The Kroger Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information.\nWe are excited to see that many of you will also be attending, either virtually or in person, our 2022 Business Update tomorrow in Florida when we will share additional details and answer questions about our long-term strategy and growth initiatives. More information about virtual registration for this event can be found at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. (Operator Instructions) Additionally, we would ask that you focus today's questions on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as our 2022 guidance. Now I will turn the call over to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital propelled Kroger to record performance in 2021 on top of record results in 2020. We are incredibly proud of our associates who continued to deliver for our customers through the pandemic. During 2021, our team delivered for all stakeholders by, first of all, achieving positive year-over-year identicals without fuel against very strong identicals last year and a 2-year stack of 14.3%.\nAlso by connecting with customers through expanding our seamless ecosystem and remarkable, consistent delivery of full fresh and friendly customer experience for everyone, plus investing more than ever before in our associates to raise our average hourly rate to $17 and our average hourly rate to over $22 when you include [compensation] and benefits as well. We balance all of these investments by achieving cost savings of greater than $1 billion for the fourth consecutive year, and alternative profits contributed an incremental $150 million of operating profit as well.\nAs we look to 2022, we expect the momentum in our business to continue, and we have confidence in our ability to navigate a rapidly changing operating environment. We are leveraging technology, innovation and our competitive moats to build lasting competitive advantages. Our balanced model is allowing us to deliver for shareholders, invest in our associates, continue to provide fresh, affordable food for our customers and support for our communities.\nWe remain confident in our growth model and our ability to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. Kroger is leading with fresh. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales, excluding fuel, during the fourth quarter. Kroger remains the #1 retailer in many exciting areas such as specialty cheese, sushi and floral. As the world's largest florist, we sold over 76 million floral stems for Valentine's Day alone. And the smiles that came along with that for our customers and associates were free.\nWe advanced our fresh strategy and strengthened our fresh offerings in 2021 by launching our Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator, supporting our commitment to small businesses. As a result of the launch, we have brought a number of new products to customers, and the initial results have exceeded our expectations. We are still early in the program, and we will continue to partner with small businesses to expand our pipeline of new products. We also remain a leader in innovation through exciting partnerships with companies like Kitchen United and Kipster. We've completed the initial test phase of our End-to-End Fresh initiatives focused on bringing more days of freshness to our customers and are confident in its scalability and with plans to expand to targeted stores across the country.\nOur brands continue to resonate strongly with customers and maintains a culture of innovation, launching over 660 new items during the year. More than half of those new items were within our Simple Truth and Private Selection portfolios. We accelerated Home Chef's incredible milestone of becoming a billion-dollar brand, our fourth greater-than-$1 billion brand, which is pretty special. As a reminder for everyone, we merged with Home Chef in 2018. At the time, we knew our customers were looking for ways to make meal time easier without compromising on taste or freshness.\nWhile Home Chef originated as a pure-play e-commerce offering, we saw immense potential to integrate and leverage it across our seamless ecosystem, scaling it within our stores and continuing to grow online. The success of this integration demonstrates our ability to integrate and scale solutions that provide value to our customers and grow our competitive moats.\nKroger is focused on delivering a seamless experience that requires 0 compromise by customers, and I think that's a really important point, 0 compromise required by customers. And what that means is the freshest products at competitive prices and flexible lead times. Yael will go into a lot more detail tomorrow on what 0 compromise means for our customers at our business update.\nThe strength in our top line sales in 2021 demonstrates our ability to meet our customers no matter how they choose to engage with us, whether it's in-store or online. At the same time, we are actively encouraging customers to engage with us on our digital platforms, even when shopping in store. That's because when a customer engages with us digitally, they spend more with Kroger within all modalities.\nWe continue to attract new customers to our digital platforms. During the quarter, we saw new seamless pickup and delivery to household acquisitions increased 25% compared to the third quarter. We remain committed to doubling digital sales and profitability by 2023, which was announced in 2021. We look forward to sharing our glide path to this goal with you tomorrow. We do not expect digital growth will be linear, especially as we cycle the sales spike in 2020 and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again.\nWe are incredibly proud of the new digital modalities we launched during 2021, including Kroger Delivery Now, our Boost membership program and the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, all of which we expect to contribute meaningfully to our long-term goals. Yesterday, we announced a new customer fulfillment center for the Cleveland region, following on heels of our announcement of a cross-dock spoke facility that will serve Oklahoma City. And just a few weeks ago, we opened our third customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia and are leveraging learnings from Monroe and Groveland to drive efficiencies and scale in the new facility. Customers are loving this new offering, and we continue to be pleased with the initial rollout of our facilities in Groveland and Monroe, and we look forward to sharing additional insights tomorrow.\nNow turning to the supply chain. Our teams across our stores, warehouses, plants and offices have been incredible in working together to supply fresh food and necessities for our customers while addressing the rapidly changing environment. During the quarter, industry challenges continued within the supply chain, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges. Within our supply chain, we continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet. We are also partnering with our suppliers to improve product availability using the strength of our data science teams to provide insights that shorten lead times and optimize inventory flow across the extended supply chain.\nWe continue to focus on expanding our transportation contracts and attracting carriers from outside our industry, which has kept product flowing predictably across our network. The teams are doing a great job managing the increased costs, and the trends within our costs are improving sequentially. We are using our data and supplier data plus leveraging technology to support future growth. We expect the supply chain to continue to improve throughout the year as a result of our actions.\nWhen I visit our stores, I often hear from our associates that what they love most about their job is that they can positively impact the lives of our customers, communities and each other every day. And it's also what I love about our business too. And it's what makes our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit, so vital for our people. One way we live our purpose is through progress toward our ESG goals and our commitments. As part of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan, last year, Kroger donated 499 million meals, that's right, 499 million meals, to feed hungry families across America. And we continue to make progress toward our goal of 0 waste.\nAs part of our commitments to helping people live healthier lives, we've administrated almost 11 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine through Kroger Health. For our more than 450,000 associates, we strive to create a culture of opportunity, and we take seriously our role as a leading employer in the United States. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first jobs, new beginnings and lifelong careers.\nAs we continue to operate in a challenging labor market, we are dedicated to attracting and retaining the right talent across the organization to be able to continue delivering for our customers. We are investing more than ever before in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness as well as the continued investment in wages that I mentioned earlier. This is enabling us to navigate current labor conditions while continuing to provide America with the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem.\nWe are cultivating an environment where all associates are able to thrive. For the fourth year in a row, Kroger earned top score in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index, the nation's benchmark in measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Last year alone, we provided more than $5 million to support associates through unexpected hardships through our Helping Hands Fund. This includes providing critical funds for disaster relief for nearly 1,300 associates.\n2021 was an incredible year for Kroger, and we are committed to continued growth. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our relentless focus on learning and improving every day. I believe this has been a key on navigating our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer-obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. And now I'd like to turn it over to Gary. Gary?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nSenior VP & CFO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger continues to execute at a high level and is delivering exceptional results while navigating a rapidly changing environment. Before I get into our results in more detail, I would like to start by echoing Rodney's appreciation to our fantastic associates. Their dedication to serve our customers and support each other throughout the pandemic has been nothing short of incredible.\nOur performance last year clearly highlights the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy as we achieved positive identical sales without fuel and adjusted EPS growth on top of record results in 2020. We also continued to invest in our customers and associates to ensure Kroger is well positioned for future success. These investments were balanced with over $1 billion in cost savings and $150 million of incremental operating profit from alternative profit streams.\nI will now provide additional color on our full year results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $3.68 per diluted share, up 6% compared to last year. Identical sales, excluding fuel, were positive 0.2% and digital sales on a 2-year stacked basis grew by 113%. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $4.3 billion, up 6% over 2020. Gross margin was 22% of sales for 2021. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 43 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and strategic price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits and growth in alternative profits.\nThe OG&A rate decreased 61 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting a reduction in COVID-related costs and cost saving initiatives, partially offset by significant investments in our associates.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.91 for the quarter, up 12% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 4%, our strongest quarter of the year, with fresh departments leading the way. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 3 basis points compared to the same period last year. The stability in our gross margin rate reflects effective management of cost inflation and sourcing benefits, offset by strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 7 basis points. This was driven by significant investments in our associates, including a year-end associate thank you reward and various asset impairments, offset by decreased COVID-related costs, sales leverage and cost saving initiatives.\nThe LIFO charge for the fourth quarter was $20 million compared to an $84 million credit in the same period last year and represented an $0.11 headwind to EPS in the quarter. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher inflation in most categories, with grocery and meat being the largest contributors. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to successfully navigate many different operating environments, and our team is doing an excellent job managing the current higher inflationary environment. We continue to leverage our data and work closely with our suppliers to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization.\nOur brands is also an important differentiator for Kroger in this environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great quality and great value. Our strategic approach is helping our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and is allowing Kroger to maintain a strong price position relative to our key competitors.\nFuel also remains an important part of our overall value proposition for our customers, and we continue to invest in our fuel program in 2021. Customers that redeem fuel points spend, on average, 4x more at Kroger and visit 4x more frequently. Our investment in fuel rewards, which is reflected in our supermarket gross margin, also helps customers stretch their dollars further and allowed us to achieve gallon growth of 5% in the fourth quarter, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.30 this quarter versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.44 compared to $0.33 in the same quarter in 2020.\nTurning now to cash flow and liquidity. Our operating results generated exceptional free cash flow in 2021, which resulted in a further strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. We were also disciplined in accelerating the return of cash to shareholders in 2021. In total, Kroger returned $2.2 billion to investors via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.\nI'd now like to take a few minutes to discuss our continued commitment to investing in our associates and our deep experience with collective bargaining. Wages at Kroger grew before and during the pandemic. As you know, we committed to significant associate wage investments when we launched our Restock Kroger program at the end of 2017. Kroger has invested an incremental $1.2 billion in associate wages and training over the last 4 years. In addition, we have committed to invest over $1.8 billion during the same time period to help address underfunding and better secure pensions for tens of thousands of associates.\nWage, health care and pensions are included in all of the more than 350 collective bargaining agreements that cover approximately 66% of our associates. These contracts are regularly negotiated by our professional labor relations team. Our objective is to negotiate contracts that balance competitive wage increases and affordable health care for associates with keeping groceries affordable for the communities that we serve. Our obligation is to do this in a way that maintains a financially sustainable business. If negotiations do become contentious, we have contingency plans in place to continue to support our communities.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Fred Meyer, King Soopers and our Michigan division, covering more than 20,500 associates. For 2022, we have contract negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Las Vegas, Southern California, Seattle, Indianapolis, Portland, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Chicago and Toledo, in addition to continued negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Little Rock and Memphis. We are actively proposing generous wage increases over the life of the various contracts we are negotiating, and these increases are included in our financial model and our guidance for 2022.\nWe are also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with unrealistic proposals, proposals that do not balance associate investments with keeping groceries affordable for our customers is untenable and undermines our shared goal of growing the company to create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates.\nIn closing, let me now provide additional color on the 2022 guidance that we released this morning. While we recognize there remain a number of uncertainties in the economic and geopolitical outlook, we believe the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy and our ability to manage multiple levers within our financial model will allow us to continue to build momentum within our business in 2022. We have shared previously that we expect to emerge from the pandemic stronger, and our guidance for 2022 creates a new baseline for FIFO net operating profit that is some $900 million higher than the midpoint of our TSR model would have projected when we announced it in 2019.\nOur plans contemplate meaningful investments in associate hourly rates as well as investments in delivering greater value for our customers and enhancing our digital capabilities. We expect these investments and the impact of cycling COVID-19 vaccine revenue will be fully offset by tailwinds in our model and allow us to grow adjusted net earnings per diluted share to between $3.75 and $3.85.\nThe tailwinds in our 2022 plan includes sales leverage from growing identical sales without fuel between 2% and 3%. We also expect to deliver cost savings of $1 billion, incremental alternative profit growth largely in line with 2021 and underlying improvement in Kroger Health profitability, excluding vaccine income. Fuel profitability is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year as gallon growth is offset by slightly lower fuel margins.\nIn terms of quarterly cadence for identical sales of our fuel and EPS growth, we expect identical sales without fuel in quarter 1 and quarter 2 will be above the midpoint of our 2% to 3% range as we expect heightened inflation will continue in the first half of the year. We would expect our second half identical sales without fuel to be below the midpoint of our range as we expect the inflation to moderate later in the year as we cycle higher inflation from the second half of 2021. Regarding adjusted EPS, we would expect quarter 1 to be above the annual growth rate range of 2% to 5%, quarter 2 to be below the range and the second half of the year to be within the range.\nTurning briefly to our capital priorities. We will continue to be disciplined with capital allocation. As you heard this morning, we are increasing capital investments to $3.8 billion to $4 billion in 2022. This reflects some catch-up from the last 2 years, where spend was below original guidance due to COVID-related constraints as well as an acceleration of our strategic initiatives that will drive longer-term earnings growth. At the same time, we expect to generate free cash flow of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. And consistent with our TSR model, we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders as evidenced by the acceleration in share buybacks over the last 6 months.\nAnd finally, we are looking forward to spending more time with you at our business update tomorrow when you will hear from key members of our leadership team about our strategic priorities and our path to deliver total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time. With that, I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\nWilliam Rodney McMullen\n\nChairman & CEO, The Kroger Co.\n\nThanks, Gary. Kroger is operating from a position of strength, and we have a variety of levers and growth opportunities to continue to build on this strength. As we reflect on 2021, we are incredibly proud of our ability to navigate both a rapidly changing operating environment and evolving customer behaviors.\nWe are obviously in an inflationary environment. Our teams are managing it well. And as Gary talked about, we are doing everything we can to keep prices low for customers, including our award-winning customer rewards program, which includes fuel rewards, our amazing and high-quality Our Brands products and personalized offers and savings for each customer individualized.\nAs we look to 2022, we are confident in our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves, serve our customers in new and exciting ways and continue to change the definition of what it means to be a grocery retailer while never losing sight of what's most important to our customers. And when we do this, we have a clear path to delivering on our commitment of 8% to 11% total shareholder returns over time for our shareholders.\nNow we look forward to your questions. As Rob shared at the top of the call, we would like to focus all questions on our quarter 4 and full year 2021 results as well as 2022 guidance. We look forward to sharing additional details about our long-term strategy tomorrow at our 2022 Business Update. So with that, we'll turn it over for questions.",

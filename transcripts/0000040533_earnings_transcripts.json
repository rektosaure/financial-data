[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNicole M. Shelton\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. .\nOn the call today are Phebe Novakovic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Danny Deep, Executive Vice President, Global Operations; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, General Dynamics Corp.\n\nThank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.88 per diluted share on revenue of $12.9 billion, operating earnings of $1.3 billion and net income of $1.59 billion. Across the company, revenue increased $1.24 billion, a strong 10.6%, led by a 30.3% increase in our Aerospace segment and a 13.8% increase in Marine Systems over the year ago quarter.\nImportantly, operating earnings of $1.3 billion, are up $150 million or 12.7%. Similarly, net earnings increased $129 million or 13.9% and earnings per share are up $0.53 or 15.8% over the year ago quarter. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $38.2 billion, is up 11% over last year. Operating earnings of $3.9 billion, are up 15.7%. Net earnings of $3.07 billion, are up 16.4% and earnings per share are up 19%. As an aside, we beat consensus estimates by $0.18 on higher-than-anticipated revenue and modestly better operating margins. My reaction to the quarter is best reflected in thoughts about the sequential comparison. In the second quarter of this year, we had very good results, which were well received by investors. This quarter was even better.\nThe 2 quarters enjoyed similar revenue, but operating margin improved by 30 basis points, and we generated significantly higher free cash flow, as you will hear in greater detail from Kim. Robust order momentum continued in the quarter, yielding record backlog. In short, we had a superb quarter from my perspective. With that, let's move into a discussion of the operating segments. First, Aerospace. Aerospace performed very well in the quarter to say the least. It had revenue of $3.2 billion and operating earnings of $430 million with a 13.3% operating margin. Revenue is a dramatic $752 million more than last year's third quarter, a 30.3% increase. The revenue increase was led by new aircraft deliveries, higher special mission volume and the services business at both Gulfstream and Jet.\nSimilarly, operating earnings of $430 million show a staggering 41% increase over the year ago quarter. The 13.3% operating margin is 100 basis points better than a year ago. We delivered 39 aircraft in the quarter, 11 more deliveries than a year ago, including 13 G700. It is important to note that this is the first quarter where we had no deliveries of the high gross margin G650ER compared to 9 in the year ago quarter. We also made 3 initial deliveries of the G800 in the quarter. This plan will provide the majority of delivery growth in Q4. For the year-to-date, Aerospace revenue is up $1.82 billion, an increase of 24.2%. Operating earnings are up $386 million, an increase of 43.9%.\nAll very impressive, especially when the comparator year 2024 showed remarkable growth over 2023. Turning to market demand. We saw accelerated interest across all models in the third quarter led by the North American market. This led to very strong order intake and loaded the pipeline for a good fourth quarter. This remains by all accounts, a very resilient and robust market for new business aircraft. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter and look forward to a strong finish to the year. So let's move on to the defense businesses.\nAs a collective, we once again saw strong growth in Marine Systems and good operating performance across the portfolio. Let me walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of $2.3 billion for the quarter, a modest 1.8% increase. Earnings of $335 million, are up 3.1%, operating margins at 14.9%, are up 20 basis points over Q3 last year, demonstrating nice operating leverage.\nOn a sequential basis, while revenue decreased 1.4%, earnings rose 3.4% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, revenue of $6.7 billion is up 1.7% and earnings of $950 million are up 3.3%. Overall, demand is strong across combat, particularly in our ordinance and international combat vehicles business. Artillery orders and the missile subcomponent work we do for the Prime has increased in our ordinance business. Internationally, demand for all classes of combat vehicles across the European theater has been increasing and orders are following, particularly in those countries in which we have indigenous production. We saw robust order intake with over $4.4 billion awarded in Q3, resulting in a book-to-bill of 2:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio and internationally, primarily Europe. Our combat system backlog at roughly $18.7 billion, reflects the strong demand.\nAll in all, a strong performance quarter for Combat that sets them up nicely for improved growth rates. Turning to Marine Systems. Yet again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $4.1 billion is up $497 million, 13.8% against the year ago quarter. Columbia Class Construction and Virginia Class Construction led the way with increased throughput. Operating earnings of $291 million, are up 12.8% over the year ago quarter, with a 10 basis point decrease in operating margin. However, we are seeing metrics showing improved performance across the business which should lead to improved operating margins little by little. Sequentially, results are about the same as the prior quarter. Year-to-date, Marine revenue of $11.9 billion, is up 14.7% and earnings of $832 million or up 13.2%. So across the business, we have seen rapid growth of revenue and earnings but margin performance around 7%. As I've said before, improvement here represents our most meaningful opportunity. And lastly, Technologies. It was another good quarter with revenue of $3.3 billion, which is down 1.6% over the year ago quarter. Operating earnings in the quarter of $327 million are essentially the same on a 10 basis point improvement in operating margin.\nThe year-to-date comparisons are better. Revenue at $10.2 billion, is up 3.5% and earnings of $987 million are up almost 5% on a 10 basis point improvement in operating margin. Order activity was particularly strong in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.8:1. That resulted in backlog at the end of the quarter of $16.9 billion, up $2.7 billion sequentially. Through the first 9 months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3:1. This positions the group ball for better revenue growth than they have had in the last 2 years. Prospects remain strong with a large qualified funnel of more than $113 billion in opportunities that they are pursuing across the group. It is interesting to observe that our slower growing segments in more recent periods have enjoyed very robust book-to-bill this quarter and year-to-date.\nThat concludes my remarks about the defense businesses. Before I hand the call over to Kim, I'd like to have Danny share his observations from an operating perspective and provide additional color.\n\nDanny Deep\n\nExecutive Vice President of Global Operations\n\nThank you, Phebe. Let me start with Aerospace. We have seen strong performance across the board, including orders, manufacturing and deliveries as well as customer service. From an order standpoint, Phebe mentioned a robust quarter across the portfolio. To give you some additional perspective, in the first 9 months of 2025, unit orders are up 56% versus this time a year ago. From a productivity standpoint, we are seeing good learning across all our lines with manufacturing hours on the G700 and G800 coming down quarter-over-quarter throughout this year.\nWe have seen measurable improvement in the supply chain with on-time deliveries to pre-COVID level. And in terms of airplane deliveries, the progress has been pronounced with our delivery cadence steadily increasing. Through the first 9 months of this year, we've delivered 113 airplanes as compared to 89 airplanes for the same period in 2024. So overall, plenty to be pleased about from an operational standpoint. Turning to our Defense businesses. I'll highlight a few key items of interest. In our Marine group, at Bath Iron Works, we are seeing positive momentum in terms of ship-over-ship learning reflected in both the number of hours to produce as well as the schedule to produce them. At Electric Boat, our productivity and schedule metrics are slowly but steadily improving as we see the investments in tooling and fixtures, automation, robotics and most importantly, our shipbuilders all taking hold.\nThese improvements have stabilized margins and put us in a position to consistently grow them over time. With respect to the supply chain, we have seen improvements in some areas, but others are still struggling to meet the significant increase in demand. In the combat Group, we have seen considerable uptick in demand in our European operations from bridges to combat platforms, and our long-term presence and manufacturing footprint in several European countries positions us well to serve this increased demand.\nIn our Technologies group, we are seeing the benefits of the strategic investments that our Mission Systems business has made in differentiated defense electronics to serve priorities and strategic deterrents, subsea warfare and next-generation command and control. As we transition from legacy programs, which are nearly completed to programs with highly differentiated content, we expect to see continued growth with robust margins for this year and into the future. Across all our businesses, our continued focus on operational performance is bearing fruit as evidenced by our third quarter results, and we expect continued margin strength and strong cash generation in the future.\nLet me now turn the call over to Kim to discuss relevant financial data.\n\nKimberly A. Kuryea\n\nVice President & Controller, General Dynamics Corp.\n\nThank you, Danny, and good morning. The third quarter was another strong quarter from an orders perspective. The overall book-to-bill ratio for the company was 1.5:1. All 4 segments experienced a book-to-bill of at least 1.2x. Our Defense segment's book-to-bill was a robust 1.6x their revenue. .\nAerospace continued its momentum with a book bill of 1.3x for the second quarter in a row, even as revenue increased in both quarters. Year-to-date, the book-to-bill for the company was a solid 1.5:1. This robust order activity led to a new record level of backlog at $109.9 billion at the end of the quarter, up 19% from a year ago and 6% from last quarter. Looking at the segments. Marine and Technology each ended the quarter with a record level of backlog. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, also ended the quarter at a new record level of $167.7 billion with each of the Defense segments reaching new highs. Moving to our cash performance.\nIt's an even better story than orders. Last quarter, we discussed our efforts to drive cash to the left given our back-end loaded cash forecast for 2025. Well, we realized the fruits of those efforts in the quarter. Our business units really outperformed our cash flow generation estimates for the quarter, driven by solid cash collections. Let's get to the specifics. Overall, we generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flow. All segments contributed to the better-than-expected results with particularly strong cash generation in Combat Systems and technologies. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.9 billion for the quarter or 179% of net income.\nComing off strong cash collections in the third quarter, we now expect about half as much free cash flow as we generated in the third quarter in the fourth quarter. Our estimate includes an increase in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our businesses, especially in electric boat and somewhat larger tax payments in the final quarter of the year. As a result, we anticipate a free cash flow conversion percentage in the low 90s for the year. This guidance includes some goodness from the reversal of the R&D capitalization, but the rest of that benefit will be lived over the next few years. Having said that, the uncertain duration and future potential impacts of the government shutdown creates a lack of clear visibility into our cash forecast for the remainder of the year. We are taking prudent actions to conserve cash and liquidity. If a resolution can be reached in the near term, we would expect to be able to achieve the forecast that I just discussed. However, in the event of a protracted shutdown, it is unclear how and when our cash flow will be impacted despite our careful efforts to diligently manage cash.\nLooking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $212 million in the quarter or 1.6% of sales and $552 million year-to-date. We are targeting over 2% of sales for the full year CapEx and given the expected investments in the fourth quarter that I mentioned a moment ago. We paid $403 million in dividends and repaid $696 million of commercial paper during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $5.5 billion down $1.7 billion from last quarter. After quarter end, we did reenter the commercial paper market to support our liquidity during the government shutdown in the event of slow or nonpayment issues. Interest expense in the quarter was $74 million compared with $82 million last year.\nThat brings interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $251 million, up slightly from $248 million last year. Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 16.7%, bringing the rate for the first 9 months to 17.2%. This rate is approaching our outlook for the full year, which remains around 17.5%.\nNow let me turn it back over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, General Dynamics Corp.\n\nThanks, Kim. So in light of the things we've just discussed, let me give you some thoughts for the remainder of the year. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of around $52 billion and margins of around 10.3%. The puts and takes around the businesses are sufficiently modest, but I will not get into them here. Overall, we are increasing our EPS forecast between $15.30 to $15.35. Some of you may regard this as a cautious forecast given the performance year-to-date. Let me remind you that we're in the midst of a government shutdown with no end in sight. The longer it lasts, the more it will impact us, particularly the shorter-cycle businesses. So forecast in this environment are difficult at best and less reliable than 1 would hope. .\nThis concludes our remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions.",

I will now turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.74 per diluted share on revenue of $13 billion, operating earnings of $1.3 billion, and net income slightly over $1 billion. We enjoyed revenue increases at three of our four business segments compared to the year-ago quarter. Across the company, revenue increased over $1 billion, an 8.9% increase. Importantly, operating earnings of $1.3 billion are up almost 13%, once again demonstrating strong operating leverage.\nSimilarly, net earnings are up 12%, and earnings per share are up 14.7% over the year-ago quarter. You will note we beat street EPS consensus by $0.19. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.3 billion is up 11.3%. Operating earnings of nearly $2.6 billion are up 17.4%, and earnings per share are up $1.26, or 20.5%.\nIn my view, this was a wonderful quarter that exceeded our expectations and led to a very good first half of the year. Let me ask our CFO, Kim Kuryea, to provide detail on our strong order activity, growing backlog, and superb cash generation, as well as other relevant financial information.\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders. We had a huge quarter with over $28 billion of orders, yielding an overall book-to-bill ratio of 2.2 to 1 for the company. The largest driver was the marine systems segment, which received several contracts for further construction of submarines. The large awards in marine almost overshadow the fact that aerospace had a tremendous quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 times. This is the strongest first half for orders since 2022 and reflected strong demand across the entire Gulfstream product line. Combat systems and technologies also had solid quarters with book-to-bill ratios of 1 times and 0.9 times, respectively. We ended the quarter with a record level of backlog of $103.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago.\nOur total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at over $160 billion, also an all-time high. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of operating cash flow, with all four segments contributing to our efforts to drive cash earlier in the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.4 billion for the quarter, yielding a cash conversion rate of 138%. Through the first half of 2025, we have free cash flow of $1.1 billion, which is well ahead of what we had planned. However, there is still work to be done as we have working capital to unwind from the balance sheet.\nWe expect a strong second half with the majority of cash generated in Q4, which should push us towards a cash conversion rate around 90% for the year, an improvement from what we were originally forecasting. Our full-year cash estimate excludes the impact of the recent tax legislation. As you know, reversing the prior law's requirement to capitalize R&D expenses will provide us a cash benefit. We are still working to develop an estimate of the exact timing and amounts associated with how that will all unfold. Now, turning to capital deployment, capital expenditures were $198 million, or 1.5% of sales, in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year, spending a little over 2% of sales for the year.\nWe paid $402 million in dividends in the quarter, but we made no share repurchases, largely due to our cash profile. Also, in the quarter, we refinanced $750 million of notes that matured in May. We have no further debt maturities until next year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion and a net debt position of $7.2 billion, down $1.2 billion from last quarter. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $88 million, compared to $84 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $177 million, up from $166 million for the same period in 2024 due to our utilization of commercial paper. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year is approximately $330 million.\nFinally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.7%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 17.4%. This rate is a little lower than our outlook for the full year, which remains around 17.5%. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Kim. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. I have asked some of our group executives to participate and provide color from their perspective as well. First, aerospace. Aerospace performed well in the quarter. It had a revenue of $3.06 billion, a 4.1% increase. Operating earnings of $403 million are 26.3% better than the year-ago quarter. Operating margin is 230 basis points better than the year-ago quarter.\nTo give you a little perspective here, Gulfstream had 38 deliveries in the quarter, including 15 G700s, which is four more than the year-ago quarter and two more sequentially. This was offset in part by fewer G650s as we made the final deliveries of this high-margin product. As I indicated previously, the supply chain continues to improve and is performing better to both schedule and quality.\nWe are finding fewer faults, and those we are finding are becoming easier to fix. In short, I'm increasingly confident that we can meet this year's delivery plan, and in fact, we are delivering G700s on a much more predictable cadence. I am pleased that all of our G700 retrofit airplanes have been delivered. Also, all of the G700s that were completed before engines were installed have also been delivered. You may recall that both of these things have negatively impacted cost and delayed deliveries.\nWe are in the process of completing the G700 flight test aircraft, and a number of them will be delivered in the second half. These are lower-margin aircraft and will be dilutive to margin, but will reduce inventory and increase operating cash by a like amount. The initial deliveries of the G800 will be made in the Q3.\nWe expect to deliver about 13 G800s for the year, which is about three less than the G650s we delivered in the second half of last year. The initial G800s will not carry the operating margins of the G650s. This will obviously put some pressure on operating margin in the second half, but we still expect the margins in the Q3 to be very similar to the Q2, coupled with a stronger Q4. In summary, the aerospace team had a solid quarter. G800 deliveries are about to commence, and G700 delivery cadence and operating margin are both improving. Anecdotally, as you may recall, the G800 was designed to replace the G650. Interestingly, the first 20 of the G800s will be the G650 owners. There is significant interest in this plane from Fortune 500 companies.\nBefore I discuss demand, I am frequently asked questions about aerospace operating margin and when it will move into the high teens, that is, above 15%. The simple answer is maybe 2026, but for sure in 2027, with degradation again in 2028 with the delivery of a significant number of G400s. The simple answer is made with some trepidation. Nothing is more complex to forecast than the operating margin for aerospace.\nSo first, let me focus on what you all think about operating margin on aircraft deliveries. This is almost always driven by mix. The G700 has the highest margins. The G800 should ultimately enjoy similar margins, but it's early in its delivery cycle. The G600 enjoys the next highest margin, followed by the G500, and G280. And let's not forget the very strong margin contribution earlier in the year from the Sunset G650 program.\nBut aircraft margins, while important because of their size, are only part of the story. Aerospace also has over $3.5 billion of sales in what we generally refer to as aircraft services business. At Gulfstream, we have a large maintenance business impacted by the amount of warranty work in a given period, over-the-counter part sales, and special mission aircraft, each with different operating margins and varying from quarter-to-quarter and impacted by both volume and mix.\nAt Jet Aviation, we have a large MRO business impacted by mix, particularly the number of large maintenance checks in a given quarter. They also have an aircraft completions business that is influenced by the mix of aircraft in-house, i.e., narrow body, wide body, or completions for Gulfstream. Jet also has a high-margin FBO business impacted by volume in any particular quarter. FBO volume happened to have been down in Q2.\nFinally, Jet has a significant aircraft management and services business that has over 300 aircraft under management. The mix of these things impacts margin quarter-over-quarter at Jet. Jet also has about $1.6 billion of annual revenue, and that is sufficient to impact margins in the group. I hope this, to some extent, helps you understand the mosaic that makes forecasts in this area so complex and the impact of both volume and mix on the result. However, do not let this discussion distract you from the main aerospace theme of steady increasing sales and earnings.\nTurning to demand, aerospace enjoyed very strong market demand in the quarter. As Kim noted, we had a 1.3 book-to-bill in the quarter, even as aircraft deliveries increased the denominator. As I said last quarter, we fully expect the certification of the G800.\nIt's better than planned performance characteristics, and early deliveries to customers will stimulate demand. We continue to see very strong interest across all models in the US, across Europe, the Middle East, and other parts of the world. So let's move on to the defense businesses. First, marine. The growth story at marine continues. Revenue of $4.22 billion is up 22.2% from the year-ago quarter and 17.6% sequentially. Similarly, operating earnings of $291 million are up 18.8% quarter-over-quarter and 16.4% sequentially.\nOperating margin of 6.9% leaves plenty of room for improvement, but let's not lose sight of the fact that operating earnings continue to grow along with sales. This particular quarter's growth was driven by Columbia-class and Virginia-class construction, as well as a slight increase in DDG-51 construction. On a sequential basis, the 10-point decline in operating margin was driven by an unfavorable EAC adjustment at NASSCO.\nBacklog increased in the quarter by $14.6 billion, or 38%, to almost $53 billion, largely the result of a contract for two Block V Virginia-class ships, including a one-of-a-kind special mission ship with considerable content. The contract also included important investment funds to support shipyard productivity, wage increases, and additional training programs. These funds complement the funding that the Navy and Congress have provided over the last several years to help stabilize and improve the submarine industrial base.\nTaken together, these will help further improve E/V throughput and productivity. As I said last quarter, in Electric Boat, we continue to experience delays and quality problems in the supply chain. Material and parts are late and sometimes exhibit quality escapes. This obviously disrupts workflow, but we are developing good workarounds. We have more work to do here, but we are making progress.\nWe are working closely with the Navy and the new administration to continue to address the problems in the supply chain and to work diligently to improve throughput and performance at Electric Boat. Our job remains to continuously improve to help the industrial base get stronger and to improve the cadence of ship delivery to the Navy. Next, combat systems. I'm going to summarize the group's results for the quarter and first half of the year and then ask Jason, their new executive vice president, to give you some color on the quarter from his perspective. Revenue in the quarter of $2.28 billion is essentially flat versus the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $324 million are up 3.5% on a 50 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.2%.\nYear-to-date, the comparison is not dissimilar, with modest revenue growth of 1.6% to $4.46 billion, stronger earnings growth of 3.4% to $615 million, and a 20 basis point expansion of operating margin to 13.8%. Sequentially, even stronger revenue growth, 4.9% to $2.28 billion, and impressive increase of 11.3% in operating earnings to $324 million on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin. Order activity was solid with a book-to-bill of 1x for the quarter. Solid performance all around for Combat Systems. Jason?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Combat and Mission Systems, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. As you can see from the numbers Phebe detailed for you, the group continues to demonstrate strong operating leverage irrespective of the top-line trajectory: flat versus the prior year quarter, up modestly year-to-date, and up more significantly on a sequential basis. That's a testament to the operating discipline of this group.\nGrowth in the quarter in Europe was offset by lower volume in our US combat vehicle business, driven largely by the cancellation of the Booker program. While the Booker cancellation represents a headwind, we've stayed very close to the Army and are supporting their efforts as they work through budget and program prioritization activities. To that point, we've invested ahead of need to make sure we're well-positioned to support priorities such as the rapid development and fielding of the next-generation main battle tank.\nThe growth in Europe is particularly encouraging and is representative of significant potential in that business as defense spending in Europe is poised to accelerate. To that point, the book-to-bill in our European business was 1.5 times in the first half, and they've got solid opportunities as we look ahead. Our munitions business continues to focus on facility expansion and increasing production rates in all areas related to artillery, including projectiles, load assembly and pack, and propellant. We're making progress and working closely with the Army in support of their artillery production goals.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Jason. And finally, technologies. As with combat, I'm going to summarize the group's results for the quarter and first half of the year and then ask Amy and Jason to give you some color on the quarter from the perspective of GDIT and mission systems respectively. The group had another strong quarter with revenue and earnings up quarter-over-quarter sequentially and year-to-date. As revenue of $3.5 billion was up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter, while earnings of $332 million were up 3.8%. Operating margin for the group was 9.6%, down 10 basis points from a year-ago on a shift in mix as GDIT grew faster than mission systems in the quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue and earnings were up by 1.3% and 1.2% respectively on a steady margin rate of 9.6%.\nFor the first half, revenue of $6.9 billion was up 6.1%, and operating earnings of $660 million were up 7.3% on a 20 basis point expansion in operating margins to 9.6%. The group continues to have solid order activity with a book-to-bill of just under 1x for the quarter and just over 1x for the first six months. As a result, the group's backlog is up 7.5% from this time a year ago, and their total estimated contract value is up more than 11% over the same period. With that, I'll turn it over to Amy first to talk about GDIT's quarter.\n\nAmy Gilliland\n\nEVP and President of GDIT, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. As Phebe noted, GDIT delivered a solid quarter and first half with growth in all of our customer-facing divisions. This performance highlights the discipline and agility of a business focused on mission execution and cost control in a particularly dynamic environment. The pace of contract award activity was slower than normal in the first half, albeit somewhat improved in the Q2. Despite significantly lower first half customer adjudications, GDIT enjoyed six wins over $100 million, including one over $1 billion. The business delivered a first half book-to-bill of essentially 1x on a growing business. First half book-to-bill would have been even stronger, but for the protest by a competitor of a significant new Q2 win in the defense business.\nWe are pleased with the results we are seeing from the investments we've made in our portfolio of digital accelerators, capabilities that enable customers to quickly leverage AI, cyber, and mission software technologies, and our deepening relationships with strategic and emerging technology partners. We reliably deliver and integrate the best technology has to offer day in and day out, and that has helped us navigate the changes in administration priorities throughout the first half. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to talk about mission systems.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Combat and Mission Systems, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Amy. Mission Systems also had a great quarter with revenue, earnings, and margins up on every comparator basis, quarter-over-quarter, sequentially, and year-over-year. As we've been discussing for some time, Mission Systems has been transitioning from legacy lower-margin programs to new franchises for several years now. So the top line has been relatively flat, even as the margin profile is improving steadily. We've said this is the final year of that transition, and so we're starting to see an inflection to growth.\nSo that's very encouraging. Like GDIT, Mission Systems has been investing ahead of need in areas like unmanned platforms, smart munitions, high-speed encryption, strategic deterrence, and contested space. And as a result, they're seeing increasing opportunities across the portfolio. To that point, their total backlog is up 15% from a year ago, and total potential contract value is up 23% over the same period.\nAll in all, a very strong first half of the year. I'll now turn it back over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nBefore getting into guidance, I wanted you to hear from Danny Deep about his new responsibilities and what we are up to here with the new executive VP for operations.\n\nDanny Deep\n\nEVP of Global Operations, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. As you are all aware, General Dynamics takes great pride in being an outstanding operating company focused on cash generation, earnings, and dependable delivery of highly differentiated and critical capabilities to our customers. As the portfolio has grown, and in some cases quite rapidly, we see opportunity across each of our business units to further optimize our operating leverage.\nAlong with the senior corporate leadership team and the operating unit presidents, we will focus on driving continuous improvement across the entire value chain, from competing to winning, while maintaining discipline in our contracts, to ensuring a robust supply chain and efficient manufacturing footprint, to execute on our commitments. We'll place particular attention on programs where we have challenges to ensure we get them up the learning curve and performing to the high standards that have been the hallmark of General Dynamics.\nIn summary, we see a wealth of value creation opportunities across the portfolio. With that, I'll turn it back to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo let me provide you our operating forecast for 2025 with some specifics around our outlook for each business group, and then the company-wide rollout. For 2025, we now expect aerospace revenue of around $12.9 billion, up around $250 million over prior estimate. Gulfstream deliveries will be 150 to 155, up a little over our previous estimate. We anticipate a 13.5% operating margin for the year, 20 basis points lower than our earlier estimate. The Q3 operating margin will be about the same as this quarter, with a somewhat better Q4. In short, revenue is up on more deliveries. Margin is down a little due to mix, airplane deliveries, and the service businesses. In combat, we expect revenue about $9.2 billion, coupled with a 14.5% operating margin. This should lead to somewhat improved earnings over our last estimate.\nAs noted earlier, the Marine Group has been on a remarkable but difficult growth journey. It will continue during the rest of 2025, albeit at slightly lower growth rate. Our outlook for this year now anticipates revenue around $15.6 billion, with operating margin of 7%, which should provide better earnings than previously estimated. In technologies, we are making no change to the 2025 revenue and earnings estimate provided at the beginning of the year. So for 2025 company-wide, we expect to see revenue of approximately $51.2 billion and operating margin of 10.3%. The revenue estimate is increased by $900 million, and the overall operating margin held constant. You have already heard Kim's commentary about our estimate for increased cash for the year. All of this rolls up to an increased EPS forecast of $15.05 to $15.15.\nTo wrap up, as we go into the second half coming off a very strong first half, we feel very good about the potential for the year. Nicole, back to you.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one again. Your first question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. Good morning and nice results.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nPhebe, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the G800 delivery cadence. You mentioned 13 in the second half. Do you have a sense for when the first one might deliver and what the skew will be Q3 to Q4? And relatedly, you've given color on the lots and the G700 margins, if you will. Any sort of guidance you can give us on how to think about G800 profitability by lots over time? Thanks.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo the first G800 should deliver very soon. And I actually am not, I don't really know the distribution of each by quarter, but we'll be pretty much on what I noted in my remarks. As you know, as we talked about before, the G700 lot 1 carried lower margins for all the developmental cost reasons. Lot 2 is better. Lot 3 is going to be better yet or is better yet, and I expect the same from lot 4. The G800 comes out of the box at a higher, lot 1 at a higher incremental margin than the 700 that didn't bear as much of the developmental cost. And it will too have margin expansion as we come both down our learning curves and move from one lot to the next.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much, and good morning.\nI wanted to ask, first of all, I thought it was helpful to have the breakdown of aerospace and thinking about the different ingredients in margin. It seems like in services, after a strong couple of years, things seem to have slowed down a little bit here in the first half. And so maybe if you could talk a little bit about kind of why that's happening. And while I realize that there's a lot of unpredictability around the different dynamics there in terms of the contributors and the mix, what sort of a good algorithm for services going forward does it grow at kind of a pace with flight hours or, I guess, deliveries or kind of how to think about it and how it fits into the margin mix going forward as well?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSure. So the theory of the case behind our services was that if we build additional service centers at or near the location of Gulfstream airplanes, then, in fact, that would drive additional incremental revenue. And in fact, that's been the case. And as I tried to walk you through in my remarks, the margins are varied principally by mix, but also by volume.\nAnd so in any given quarter, it depends heavily both at Jet Aviation and Gulfstream on what the mixes of both MRO and then, in the case of Jet, a lot of their other services lines of business that also accrue to the margin story. So I don't know that there's a given algorithm for thinking about margin in the service world, but we expect it to continue to grow with the fleet. And we're very pleased with how we have done there.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, it seems like based on the new guidance with technologies unchanged, there's a step down in terms of both margin and sales in the second half. And so maybe if you could talk a little bit about what's driving that and then kind of where it goes from here?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So we were given the fluidity in that market so far this year. We thought it prudent to keep our earnings and our revenue estimates about where they are. But I'll ask both first, Amy, and then Jason to give you a little bit of color.\n\nAmy Gilliland\n\nEVP and President of GDIT, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning. So from a GDIT perspective, we did navigate first half 2025 very well. That was not without some impact from contract scope changes, from cancellations of some of our contracts. And so as we look at the second half, the thing that will most impact our positioning is really the cadence of award activity. And as commented in my remarks, the adjudications were down significantly in first half of 2025 compared to first half of 2024. And so we're running out of days of the year to be able to win that work and deliver on it. And so really, from a revenue expectation, it is the pace of adjudications that we're watching for the second half, but feel very good about where we are from an earnings perspective. Jason?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Combat and Mission Systems, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So from Mission Systems perspective, a good bit of the strength that we saw in the first half came from activity in their high-speed encryption product business, which is—it's really a transactional business. And so while we still see incredible demand on that side of the business, the timing of that is somewhat less predictable given the transactional nature. So I would tell you there's opportunity for them in the second half, depending on how that demand goes. But as Phebe said, just given the uncertainty overall in the market for the group as a whole, that's the reason we're holding to the full year guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst of Global Aerospace and Defense, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst of Global Aerospace and Defense, Bernstein\n\nOn Marine, the big increase you saw in revenues in Q2. That's unusual to see that large of a jump there. Can you talk about what happened specifically related to Virginia-class, Columbia-class that really took it up so much?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo Virginia was about 60% of the volume, Columbia about 40%. It really just was the construction volume. I'd say we'll give you a little bit of perspective here. We've been growing on average about 9% year-over-year for the last couple of years. Some quarters we've hit high teens, but I'd say the 22% growth in this quarter is really just a question of largely both timing, but also continued increasing performance at the shipyard.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst of Global Aerospace and Defense, Bernstein\n\nWell, and then you've gotten this early in the quarter, you got the award for the last two Block V boats, which was certainly very good news with support for labor. Can you talk about the increased funding, both that and what we may see in the 2026 budget, and how you can get that to translate into higher throughput, which it looks like you're already getting some of, and ultimately higher margin as well?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nOkay. Let me answer that kind of in the inverse order. As we've been telling you for some time, the margin improvement at the Marine Group, and particularly within the submarine industrial base, improves that Electric Boat when we get additional stabilization in that industrial base and in our supply chain. So that has been a key driver of really the productivity at the shipyard. And as you know, part of our strategy is really dependent on controlling what we can control and on the deck plates, getting better and better and better, maximizing or optimizing the work we have in-house with workarounds on late deliveries from major suppliers, as well as any quality escapes. So that's sort of, if you think about our big strategy, it's that.\nWe are seeing productivity improvements in a number of key places on the deck plates and that Electric Boat, frankly, in our other businesses as well across the board. I would say that with respect to the supply chain, we've seen some stabilization and improvement in some important areas. The Navy and the Congress have been allocating funding for the industrial base to undergird their performance, and some of that is beginning to improve, but we've got a ways to go there.\nWith respect to the fiscal year 2026 funding levels, we're still working out with our Navy customer what the exact funding levels are by program. There's a fair amount of complexity as we unpack the 2026 budget and the reconciliation bill, but our programs are fully supported. Then with respect to the anomaly, we were glad to get that under contract.\nOne of those boats is a particularly complicated boat. As we gear up on that, and I think that this is important, that contract was important in that it provided the type of funding for the shipyards that we've seen going into the supply chain over the last few years. That kind of funding support on training and wage increases, as well as productivity, Navy funding, and productivity improvements at each one of those, at each of the yards, that'll be very, very helpful as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning. Phebe, does getting to high teens margins at aerospace require meaningfully higher Gulfstream deliveries than the 150 to 155 you're planning for 2025? Or is that bridge to high teens primarily driven by coming down the learning curve and optimizing the mix?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nOh, I think it's a combination of all of that. I tried to spend some considerable time in my remarks dragging you all through the knot hole that is aerospace margins. So I'm not quite sure what other clarification I can give you. But it'll be mixed and it'll be volume in simple terms.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. That's fair. And sorry if I missed this, but was the order strength at Gulfstream this quarter pretty well spread across aircraft types, or was it concentrated in any particular pockets of the Gulfstream portfolio, particularly in the context of the G800?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nIt was across all of our airplanes. First was the 700, 600 right behind it. We had nice geographic distribution as well. It was good solid demand. We continue to see that in Q3 with particular interest in the 800, I might add.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. You may go ahead.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner of Global Aerospace and Defense, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner of Global Aerospace and Defense, Vertical Research Partners\n\nPhebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the management reorganization that you announced this quarter and how this could affect the way that the business is run going forward? Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, it was one of the reasons I asked Danny to give you some clarity on how we see his role in particular playing out. We'll continue to manage the business as we have been managing it and really driving for value creation across each and every one of our portfolios. But as we grow, we have believed as a leadership team, and we've talked on this call, and I've talked with many of you individually and in groups about our desire to increase our operating leverage.\nAnd you'll note in almost every single one of our calls, we'll stress and point out and then stress where we are on our operating leverage. So one of Danny's missions is to really focus on the operating performance of each and every one of our businesses. But we will manage the business in the same way.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner of Global Aerospace and Defense, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay. Quick follow-up. Are you also looking to combine combat and mission going forward, or are they going to remain standalone businesses?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nNo. We'll keep them as they are.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner of Global Aerospace and Defense, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace and Defense, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace and Defense, Barclays\n\nPhebe, following up on Rob's question. So the portfolio as a whole, I think, used to run in the range of 12% to 13% margins more recently, running in the low 10s. I know there are a lot of moving pieces. But any thoughts you might have in terms of where the margin potential is for the portfolio as we move forward?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo look, as Danny noted, we pride ourselves on our operating performance. And I think we can improve, and particularly, I mean, the sort of the one that jumps out at you is in the Marine Group. So those margins over time need to improve. But I'll ask Danny if he has any particular insights. He's not that far into his new position, but he's been a senior operating executive with the company for some time.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace and Defense, Barclays\n\nOkay. Well, thank you.\n\nDanny Deep\n\nEVP of Global Operations, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. I mean, I think Phebe hit it. We're going to look across each of the operating units and program by program, and where we've had some challenges in getting up the learning curve, I think that's where our focus is going to be. And not to point any one particular operating unit out, but if you look at where the largest operating pieces of the business are and where we've historically had our margins, that's where we see our best opportunities. But this company has been focused on operations and has been very disciplined from an operating perspective for a long time. And we're just going to put a finer point on that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the lines of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Phebe, the strength of bookings at Aerospace in the first half, are you feeling more confident in seeing a book-to-bill at or above 1 for 2025 at this point?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWe're keeping it at about 1. That's sort of been our cadence and our thought pattern and our observations, frankly. But the demand has been quite good, and as I noted in one of the previous answers to one of the questions, we see that demand carrying through into Q3.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned margin pressure in 2028 from the G280. I had my notes of certification in 2026.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\n400.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nSorry. Sorry. The G400. I had in my notes that that certification was in 2026. Has that slipped to the right?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI don't think so. Uh-uh. I will tell you, we've slowed down the 400 a bit because we've got our hands full. That's not about the FAA. It's simply we've got an awful lot as we continue to grow and really work on our operating leverage at Gulfstream. But 400 is doing quite well. But I think we've—I don't know that we've ever actually given you—I don't recall that we've given you an entry into service estimate. And the word is estimate. But I was just trying to give you some kind of color about year-over-year progression without getting into next year's guidance, which, of course, we won't do.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Very good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you, Phebe. Really appreciate the color on Arrow. I might follow up a little bit on Myles's question. Just, I think the point on aerospace is it's a stable, growing business, both on revenues and operating profits. Maybe if you could talk about just the capacity of volume Gulfstream could produce. Is it growing off this 150 base annually? To Myles's question, why the dip in 2028 if G400 comes in there? I thought it would be maybe a year after the 800. If you could just provide that dip timing.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nAs the 400 comes on, it'll be a lower margin airplane than the very large cabin. And I think, remind me what the first part of your question was?\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nJust on the capacity, production capacity.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nOh, right. Yeah. So on the capacity question, we've got the plant and equipment, jigs and fixtures, as well as the workforce to support a capacity of 200 airplanes. But we'll continue to work to increase our production according to the market.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nMaybe one more if I could ask. Was services down in the quarter?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYes.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. You may go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Phebe, you mentioned you made some comments about NASSCO, maybe a small negative EAC there. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit generally about what's going on out at NASSCO and the priorities of the new administration, and the impact that that might have on that yard out there. And then just provide a little color on that EAC.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So let me talk about sort of what we see as the market environment, and then I'll turn it over to Danny to talk a little bit about this particular EAC impact, which, by the way, at NASSCO is extremely unusual. So let's just set the table here and remind ourselves that NASSCO produces primarily auxiliary ships for the US Navy. And the demand for those has been increasing over the last few years, and we continue to see that need as warships all need support ships in order to function at sea. So we've seen nice increases in demand, and we expect that to continue. We're working on the EULA program, and we've got several other programs in place as well. But I'll turn it over to Danny to talk about this quarter's EAC.\n\nDanny Deep\n\nEVP of Global Operations, General Dynamics\n\nOkay. Yeah. So at NASSCO, it really started with the flood and the impact the flood had on our prime line. It took us down from two lines to one, and then we had a subsequent issue. After that issue, it created a fair bit of rework in the system. So that's what's reflected in the EAC as we speak. We think we'll largely be through that by the end of the year and have both of those prime lines up and running, and this issue will be behind us.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nOkay. Lacey, I think we have time for just one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nFinal question comes from the line of Scott Mikus with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector of Aerospace, Defense, and Space Research, Melius Research\n\nGood morning. Phebe, the Secretary of the Navy commented that it might be preferable to have Huntington Ingalls and Electric Boat each build Virginia-class submarines separately rather than in a teaming arrangement. So if the Navy were to actually pursue that route, how much capital would you need to invest to make that happen? And is there enough skilled labor for Electric Boat to handle one Virginia by itself while also continuing to work on Columbia?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo skilled labor has not been an issue for Electric Boat for some time now. And we do not see a capacity problem in the region with the availability of our touch labor. So we can support additional growth. We would need some additional capital if, in fact, the Navy opts on that strategy, but not an enormous amount. But I'll defer to the Navy on any future discussions about that.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector of Aerospace, Defense, and Space Research, Melius Research\n\nOkay. And then a quick question on aerospace. The book-to-bill in the quarter was very good despite the stock market's perturbations around Liberation Day. Have you seen any uptick in the pipeline since the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law and reinstated bonus depreciation?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI wouldn't cite one macroeconomic factor. I think that there were a lot of them here. There wasn't one in particular, from my perspective, that drove the demand. Bonus depreciation helps quite a bit. Always has.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the Q2 earnings release and highlights presentation. Finally, we want to let you know that we expect to hold our Q3 earnings call on Friday, 24 October at 9:00AM. That's a slight change from our normal practice of announcing earnings on Wednesday. So we want to advise you of that early for planning purposes. We will resume our normal schedule for the Q4 call. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the General Dynamics Q1 2025 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies. I will now turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $3.66 per diluted share on revenue of $12.2 billion, operating earnings of $1,268,000,000 and net earnings of $994 million. These results compare quite favorably to the year-ago quarter. Revenue is up 13.9%, operating earnings are up 22.4%, and net earnings are up 24.4%. As a result, earnings per diluted share are up $0.78, or 27.1%, more than the year-ago quarter. The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4%, a 70 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. While aerospace led the way with a 45.2% revenue increase, each of the defense segments also enjoyed revenue increases. A similar pattern is true with respect to operating earnings.\nAerospace led the way with a stunning 69.4% increase, and each of the defense segments contributed nice improvements to operating earnings as well. We have obviously opened the year with a very strong quarter. It is important to note that the comparative quarter in 2024 also showed very good growth in all respects over Q1 2023. We also beat consensus by $0.16 in the quarter. At this point, let me ask Kim Kuryea, our CFO, to provide detail on our order activity, solid backlog, and cash activity before I come back with segment observations.\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders and backlog. We had a solid quarter with over $10 billion of orders. Order activity was particularly strong in the technologies group with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 to 1. Our overall book-to-bill ratio for the company was less than one time, due in part to the 14% increase in revenue from last year.\nThis resulted in total backlog being slightly down from year-end to $89 billion at quarter-end. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at a little over $141 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter, we expected a slow start to the year. In terms of timing, this year will look a lot like last year, with cash building throughout. The buildup of inventory as we approached certification and entry into service of the G800 impacted aerospace.\nAlthough technologies had a solid quarter, the defense businesses as a whole were impacted by a working capital buildup due to growth in timing. As a result, our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $290 million. This was better than expected as our business units worked to drive cash to the left. For the rest of the year, we expect modestly positive cash flow in Q2, followed by substantially improving free cash flow in each of Q3 and Q4. Now, to discuss capital deployment activities. Capital expenditures were $142 million, or 1.2% of sales, in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year, as we anticipate spending around 2% of revenue on CapEx investments in our businesses this year.\nAlso, in the quarter, we returned in excess of $980 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This included $383 million paid in dividends and repurchases of approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for $600 million, at an average price of just over $252 per share. In addition, in late March, we repaid $750 million of notes that matured on 1 April 2025.\nAs a reminder, we have an additional $750 million of notes maturing in May. Although we ultimately intend to refinance those notes, the timing of when we do that may be influenced by market conditions. When you add it all up, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of around $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $8.4 billion. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million, compared to $82 million last year.\nThe increase was due to utilization of commercial paper during the quarter. Finally, turning to income taxes, we had a 17.2% effective tax rate in the quarter, generally consistent with our full-year guidance. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Kim. Now, let me review the quarter in the context of the business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace did particularly well in the quarter. It had revenue of $3.03 billion and operating earnings of $432 million, with a 14.3% operating margin. Revenue is $942 million more than last year's Q1, a 45.2% increase. To give you a little color here, the increase was driven by a 50% increase in aircraft deliveries, including 13 new G700s and higher services revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation.\nThe 36 deliveries in the quarter are about as planned. Recall, however, that there were no G700 deliveries in the Q1 of 2024. So this quarter really shows the robust revenue increase driven by the introduction of the G700. In addition, we saw improved margins on our G700 deliveries.\nIn short, we expect revenue growth throughout the year, but at a slowing rate of growth because G700 deliveries began in the Q2 of last year. As I indicated last quarter, the supply chain continues to improve and is performing better to both schedule and quality. We are finding fewer faults, and those we are finding are becoming easier to fix. In short, I am increasingly confident that we can meet this year's delivery plans.\nWe are also pleased that the G800 was certified by both the FAA and the EASA on 16 April. This is expected to be a smooth entry into service, and we have some reason to believe that we can exceed our planned deliveries of G800s. I would be remiss if I failed to mention that Jet Aviation made a significant contribution to the quarter's results.\nIts revenue was up 8% and earnings up 22% over the year-ago quarter on a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin. This business has become a real jewel. In summary, the aerospace team has had a good quarter. G800, FAA, and EASA certification is behind us, and we are improving our G700 delivery cadence and operating margin. Turning to market demand, we had a 0.8 book-to-bill in the quarter, even as aircraft deliveries increased by 50%. Orders are consistent with our internal plan at about the same number of units as the Q1 in 2023 and 2024. We expect that the certification of the G800, it's better than planned performance characteristics, and the early deliveries to customers will stimulate demand.\nWe continue to see improved interest across all models in the US, albeit with cautious concern by customers about the macroeconomic environment and the impact of tariffs on their businesses. Middle East activity remains strong. So let's move on to the defense businesses. Combat had revenue of $2.18 billion, up 3.5% over the year-ago quarter. Earnings of $291 million are up 3.2%. Margins at 13.4% are consistent with the year-ago quarter.\nIt's interesting to observe that this year's revenue growth is on top of our Q1 2024 growth of almost 20%. So nice compound growth. The increased revenue performance occurred at Ordnance and Tactical Systems, and European Land Systems held steady. We also experienced good order performance. Orders in the quarter drove backlog to $16.9 billion, up $1.3 billion from this time a year ago. Demand for combat system products continues to be robust, with particular strength in Europe.\nOrders for wheeled and tracked vehicles are up, reflecting the heightened threat environment. In addition to several new combat vehicle starts, we are working closely with the U.S. Army to accelerate Abrams modernization. In the US, we are rapidly increasing munitions capacity and production with the opening of our projectile facility in Texas and our load, assembly, and pack facility in Arkansas.\nAll in all, combat had a solid quarter and is off to a good start for the year. Turning to marine systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me repeat the recent history that I gave you this time last year with respect to growth in this decade. The Q1 of 2020 was up 9.1% against Q1 2019. Q1 2021 was up 10.6% over Q1 2020. Q1 2022 was up 6.8% over Q1 2021.\nQ1 2023 was up 12.9% over Q1 2022. Q1 2024 was up 11.3% over Q1 2023. Finally, this quarter is up 7.7% over Q1 2024. This has been a really nice rate of growth for the shipyards and the repair yards. This growth has come at significant costs for facilities and significant increase in hiring. The good news is we've been able to hire and train the people we require to support our growth.\nThis particular quarter's growth was driven by Columbia-class and Virginia-class construction, as well as an increase in DDG-51 construction. Operating earnings are $250 million in the quarter, up 7.8% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin is identical to last year's quarter. We have struggled to achieve operating leverage to go with our rapid revenue growth, but operating earnings have grown on a consistent basis as well.\nWe continue to be impacted by delays and quality problems in the supply chain. Material and parts are late, and sometimes exhibit quality escapes. New shipbuilders continue to come down learning curves. We have more work to do, but we have made progress. In addition, one of the unions, the Draftsmen, a largely white-collar union that converts engineering specs to drawing, has voted to authorize a strike.\nWe are working closely with the Navy and the new administration to continue to address the problems in the supply chain and look for opportunities to improve throughput and performance at the shipyard. The growth profile continues to look strong, and demand is not abated. Our job is to continue to improve ourselves and to help the industrial base get stronger with the help of the government. The technologies group had a strong start to the year with revenue of $3.43 billion.\nThis was an increase of 6.8% over Q1 2024. Both businesses contributed to the growth in the quarter, with GDIT up 9% and mission systems up almost 2%. Operating earnings of $328 million were up 11.2% over the year-ago quarter on a 40 basis points improvement in operating margins from 9.2% to 9.6%. The operating margin improvement is encouraging given the top-line shift toward IT services, which carry a lower margin than the defense electronics side of the portfolio. This reflects strong performance at mission systems as the transition from legacy programs to new franchises continues. The group's order activity was also encouraging, with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times for the quarter and a trailing 12 months, even against the strong revenue growth.\nAs a result, the group's backlog is up almost 7% from a year ago, and their total estimated contract value is up more than 10% over the same period. They're focused on advanced technology enabling autonomous platforms, smart munitions, subsea warfare, and strategic deterrence, as well as advanced AI, cloud, cyber, 5G, and quantum solutions, which is driving demand for the group. Their pipeline of qualified opportunities remains strong at $120 billion, and their win and capture rates in the 80% range reflect the compelling value they're providing their customers. While this year is off to a strong start, a significant amount of uncertainty hangs over the market, particularly on the IT services side of the business, as the administration establishes its own spending priorities.\nThat said, our team has a great understanding of the government's emerging technology needs and is committed to innovating to solve the toughest technical challenges across the government at the best return for their customers. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of year. Apart from what I've already said about aerospace, I will continue with that practice. There is, however, no hiding from this quarter's performance and its implications for the year. Let me speak to tariffs for a moment. We cannot yet discern to what extent the defense businesses will be impacted over time. The more potentially impactful problem is in aerospace, where we are a significant net provider of export revenue to the US. We do not know the scope and breadth of the tariff issue at the moment and will not for a while.\nAccordingly, anything I might say on that subject would be sheer speculation. So I do not intend to answer questions on the subject of tariffs because anything I say on that subject, given our lack of firm knowledge, will almost certainly be wrong. That's to show that we are working the related issues diligently. This concludes my remarks about a good quarter, and let me turn the call back to Nicole to take questions.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. And again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question. We will take our first question from Peter Arment at Baird.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Kim, Jason, Nicole. Nice results. Hey, Phebe, maybe just given in the spirit of everything that's on, GDIT Technology segment had a really good bookings quarter, kind of bucking the trend of the industry. Maybe could you talk a little bit about, I guess, any visibility or any discussions that GD is supporting, kind of the GSA and their efforts, and just how are things looking from a bookings and a cost savings environment with the current administration?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah, Peter, that's a good question. I asked Jason to join us on the call to provide us more color for those of you who wanted some, so I'll turn that over to Jason.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Phebe. And good morning, Peter. I think, as you'd expect, along with a number of GDIT's peers that I'm sure you've heard from, we've been in active conversation and actively working with the customer to identify opportunities for savings, for increased value, and so on from the services and the solutions that we provide. I think it's important to, as a reminder, that we are not strictly in the consulting business per se. We deliver mission-driven solutions. We deliver solutions to the customer's most challenging technology issues. But the fact is we are in the conversation. And as part of that conversation, we are going to partner with our customer, and we are going to find the savings that they're looking for.\nAt this point, the only thing I could comment in terms of what we're seeing in our results is you heard about the strong results in the quarter. Q1 was very strong, not only from a revenue and earnings standpoint, but also the order book was healthy. So on the one hand, we're seeing a little bit of sluggishness in the solicitation and the proposal and award process, no different than the rest of our peers.\nBut we'll have to see how that plays out, how long that sustains, and how much of that is just an impact of a new administration setting their priorities and no different than any transition we see with a new administration. So a lot still to be determined. Nothing to change yet. The outlook for the year remains the same. I think we'll know a lot more by the midpoint of the year.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks, Jason. Thanks, Phebe.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Jason Gursky at Citi.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Anayst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning. First question, Phebe. Maybe just get some comments from you and your take on the administration's desire to stand up, I don't know, Office of Shipbuilding inside the White House and all the efforts that we're seeing from them on supporting the industrial base here in the United States. We just love to get your take on what you're hearing.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So we've been in touch with the office. We're very happy to have the focus on shipbuilding across the enterprise. So we consider that all goodness. And we've had productive conversations with multiple elements of the administration. And we're working with them to see, in some cases, how we can accelerate throughput productivity, how we can shore up the industrial base, particularly on the defense side, and opportunities for more commercial shipbuilding where they may arise. So I think attention on a subject of national import is always beneficial.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Great. Then a quick follow-up question would just be on the executive orders that hit last week about the potential for, seems like, a rewrite of federal acquisition regulation. I just would love to get your take on this administration's approach to procurement reform. Seems like every administration comes in and wants to reform how acquisition is done. Just curious if you think this one's going to be any different kind of potential opportunities and risks as we go through this process for the industrial base writ large. Thanks.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo I think that acquisition reform is always laudatory. And I think the extent to which it succeeds is understanding what works in the acquisition process and what doesn't. So I think that part of the dialogue we're all having is, \"Here's the good things,\" because there are an awful lot of good things within the process. But here are all the impediments, the cost drivers, the elements that tend to slow down or build bureaucracy. So I think those are good conversations. And we've always been supportive of acquisition reform.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to David Strauss at Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHi, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nPhebe, has there been any change in kind of the order activity or customer interests? Any noticeable change that you've seen at Gulfstream post all the tariff announcements in early April? Any slowing or anything?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThe pipeline remains good. I'd say everyone's a little bit cautious figuring out to the extent to which the tariffs will impact any one of their businesses. But the pipeline remains strong across the portfolio of products. So so far, so good.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nOkay. And a follow-up on the marine side. Could you give an update on getting the money, the significant funding that was in the CR under contract, and maybe progression on the larger Block 6 Virginia-class contract?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo we're working with the administration on getting the supplemental funding in the CR under contract. We've had very productive conversations and will continue those. So I don't think it's appropriate to talk anymore about that. But to the extent to which that we get those funds into the shipyards, into wages, and additional throughput capacity, that's all beneficial in the big conversations that have to happen around Block 6 and the second build of Columbia. So the Navy intends for those to happen this year. But I think we need a lot of building blocks before we get there, including getting the supplemental under contract and starting to execute there.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll move to Robert Stallard at Vertical Research.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nPhebe, you said some positive things about the aerospace supply chain that you've experienced in the last couple of months. But I was wondering if, in recent weeks, this whole tariff thing has shifted the landscape here, particularly with regard to engines?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo let's just be clear about the supply chain. They've made very good progress. But the problems are not all behind us. And so we continue to work out-of-station work and continue to find some issues. I think it's a little soon to tell within the supply chain the extent to which we've got real concerns or their suppliers have real concerns. I would say that a lot of what we consume, internal consumption material, has a significant amount of US content. So how all of this plays out remains to be seen here.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kristine Liwag at Morgan Stanley.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nJason, I want to focus on technologies a little bit. You mentioned that you're working on savings that you can provide the customer. It seems like the GSA was disappointed with the initial proposals from the industry about cost savings. So can you talk about what's the potential size of savings you could provide with the new approach, and if we could size the potential effect on your revenue stream as this materializes? That'd be great. Thanks.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. I'm afraid I'm going to give you an answer you're not going to be happy with, Kristine. I think the point is, as I said, we are in a good, healthy, active discussion with that customer. We are identifying savings. Some of that, as you might imagine, is from a conversation that's been discussed quite a bit around shifting to fixed-price and outcome-based type contracts, which we very much welcome. We have a good, healthy portion of that in our backlog and portfolio already. But the fact is it's an ongoing dialogue with the customer. And so I think it'd be inappropriate to get out ahead of that in a public conversation and get ahead of them on that.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. And then, Phebe, if I could have a follow-on on Gulfstream. I mean, you now have the G800 certified, and you had previously had the G700 as well. At this point, with the new products for Gulfstream coming out, it looks like there's a little uptick on the older G600s coming to market. I know you mentioned that there hasn't been significant change in demand, but I was wondering if you could provide color regarding customer behavior and how the deliveries of these newer jets are affecting the older pieces and how you expect that to play out regarding pricing.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nIt's interesting. Old is relative. These are brand new airplanes. I got to take your point, but with a little bit of humor here. The interest in the 500 and 600 continued to be very strong. Each one has its market segment, fulfills different missions. Just so you know, an older airplane, again, from a relative point of view, is the 650. I think we delivered the last six 650s this quarter. That's kind of a seminal end to really an extraordinary airplane. I would say a real market changer for the last 12, 15 years. Demand remains good. The deliveries are largely on cadence. Again, we still have some perturbations from the supply chain. We'll hopefully get some of those behind us as the supply chain more fully recovers. I hope that answers your question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll move to Ken Herbert at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Phebe and everybody. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nNice Gulfstream deliveries in Q1, Phebe. It sounds like supply chain's getting better. Sounds like maybe there's some incremental upside to fulfill your expectations. But can you provide any commentary on cadence of deliveries as we think about Q2 and second half of the year from Gulfstream?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI think pretty consistent. We'll have some mixed changes quarter over quarter like we typically do, but pretty consistent. And we're sticking with the estimate that we gave you on the last call. As you all know, we never, I think once in the last 12, 13 years, have we once or twice ever updated in the Q2 or in the Q1. We always wait till the Q2. So we'll give you more clarity to the extent that there are any changes in that Q2 update.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Great. And just as a follow-up, you called out Middle East good order activity there. Are you seeing anything else geographically, maybe any areas of softness or anything else that sticks out in terms of customer activity on Gulfstream?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nPretty much consistent with what we've seen recently. The US is strong and Middle East is strong. So far, I haven't seen any systemic changes here.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Scott Mikus at Melius Research.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nMorning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nPhebe, quick question on marine. General Cotton of U.S. Strategic Command recently stated that the Columbia program of record may need to be increased given today's elevated threat environment. Considering the Navy's fleet of 14 Ohio-class submarines carry 280 SLBMs, but each Columbia is only designed to carry 16 SLBMs, is there interest from the DoD that you've heard about increasing the Columbia program to maintain a one-to-one replacement of SLBM launch capability?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThat's an interesting question. That has been a national security question on and off, I'd say, for the last 15 years or so. So I haven't heard anything new, particularly on that subject. But it is frequently a question that comes up or a subject that comes up in extended conversations. So I'm sure it is on people's minds.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nOkay. And then turning to Gulfstream, deliveries were very good this quarter. Were there any customers that tried to accelerate the deliveries to get ahead of the tariffs?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nNot that I'm aware of.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Gavin Parsons at UBS.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks. Morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nPhebe, you mentioned the improvement in the G700 margin. Was Q1 better than your plan, and do you still expect a step down in the Q2 and Q3 margin?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. We're holding consistent for a whole series of reasons, including mix, among others, in the Q2, pretty much the progression that we gave you last call in January. So again, if that changes, we'll update you at the end of Q2. But so far, that's still our plan.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies, General Dynamics\n\nOkay. Appreciate it. You mentioned you expect G800 certification to drive a step up in orders there. Did you book any G800s in Q1?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWe've had, yeah. I'm almost certain we did. And we've had certainly additional interest since the certification. It's a popular airplane. Let's recall that airplane is the replacement for the 650. 650s, as I noted, are out of production at the end of this quarter. It's already out of production, actually, largely, and we're in the delivery mode. So the last delivery will be this quarter. So that'll be an additional, I think, stimulant to demand.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nMorning. I wanted to ask, in Marine, just starting off with the 7% margin kind of slightly higher than what was initially expected for the year, and potentially bringing those last two Block V boats under contract, well, hopefully bringing those boats under contract this year. We'll see about the rest. Does that create maybe a little bit less risk when we think about the margin outlook for Marine versus the past two years?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI think to the extent that we can continue to stimulate throughput and productivity in the supply chain as well as at the shipyard, that is always a risk reduction. So I think every time that we can facilitate that, that is a good thing. I'll just note on the 7% margin, we had a charge in the Q4 last year that didn't revisit, and that was some mix driven. But you didn't ask this question, but I'll answer it anyway. We will stick with, as we stand today, with we're going to hover in the upper sixes in margin. But yes, as I said, any action on the part of the government to stimulate productivity always takes risk out of the profile.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up on the capital deployment and balance sheet, with the share purchases in Q1, I guess will affect the share account for the year. I think, Ken, you mentioned maybe waiting potentially to refinance some of the debt that's due in Q2. Should we think about some incremental interest expense at all this year that maybe offsets some of the goodness from share repo? Or I guess, how do those two things kind of net out? And then, Phebe, I think you've said over time that you're typically opportunistic on share repo, and this was a bigger quarter than we're used to seeing. And so what was kind of the thought process around that?\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nSure. I'll start just to clarify. I didn't necessarily say we were waiting. We're just watching what's happening in the market in terms of the rates related to the refinancing of the debt. So just wanted to clarify on that. And as you stated, we did have significant share repurchase in the Q1, and we continue to look at share repurchase throughout the rest of the year depending on the facts and circumstances as they present themselves. And so I would say that we will likely have slightly more interest expense predicted for the rest of the year.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI would say too, our general attitude about capital deployment is unchanged, and our share repurchases are opportunistic. But the stock was a good buy in a lot of instances this quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Andre Madrid at BTIG.\n\nAndre Madrid\n\nVP and Aerospace and Defense Analyst, BTIG\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nAndre Madrid\n\nVP and Aerospace and Defense Analyst, BTIG\n\nGiven all the recent tension around trade, do you think there's a reluctance moving forward for allies to work with US contractors? I mean, you saw several Northern European nations kind of coming together and saying that they were intending to collectively buy a competing infantry combat vehicle. Do we expect stuff of this magnitude kind of moving forward? And yeah, like I said, do we expect trade to kind of linger and weigh on allies dealing with contractors like GD?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI think that we have to see how all that plays out. But I think you know that we are a little bit different. And this is largely talking about combat systems because that's our preeminent business in Europe. But this is a European business run by Europeans with manufacturing facilities in Europe, sourced in Europe almost exclusively. So these are long-standing, 30-year, in some instances, companies in their home countries. So I think we're a little bit different. I would say that the demand in Q1 for European-made, sourced GD products was certainly there. And European Land Systems has a superb portfolio of products to offer. And we have seen increased demand and increased spending. So that bodes well from our perspective for these businesses.\n\nAndre Madrid\n\nVP and Aerospace and Defense Analyst, BTIG\n\nGot it. Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could just squeeze in one more. I think some of your peers pointed out a slower pace of contract awards in the Q1. Did you see anything of this nature? Could you provide more color there?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. I was going to say not in the majority of the portfolio, but Jason, go ahead.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. I think as it relates to the technologies group, as you saw in the results, it was actually a very encouraging quarter from an orders perspective on a pretty meaningful uptick in revenue. We had a book-to-bill greater than one-to-one. So so far, we're not seeing an impact through the end of Q1. As Phebe said, the pipeline for the business remains very strong. The issue that I think most people are talking about, and we're seeing frankly the same thing, is what I would refer to as perhaps a sluggishness, if you will, in the cadence of solicitations and award activity. But as a reminder, that's not necessarily something new for this business.\nIn the GDIT side in particular, we've talked for some time about dealing with these types of issues of protracted and drawn-out adjudications and award activities, protests, and other things that sort of extend that order cadence beyond what would be a regular order. So while this is something we're tracking and it's something everybody's talking about, I don't necessarily think it's something aberrationally different than what we've been used to dealing with in the past. And so we'll just have to see how it plays out as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Phebe, Kim. Phebe or Kim, maybe two follow-ups if I can, both on margins, one on aerospace and one on marine. On aerospace, can you just update us on how we think about the last G650 being delivered in this quarter as the G800 ramps and how we think about the different blocks with G700 progressing throughout the year?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo we're continuing to improve G700 margins. We are not, however, at what I would call a normal cadence yet. And so once we hit that, then we will begin to progress margins even further. The 650 will deliver at high margins, and the 800 will come in at higher margins than the 700 because it's not carrying as much burden of R&D as the 700s did, first lot of 700s. So these are all, I think, beneficial to us. And you had a question on the marine margins?\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nYes, please.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nIn particular?\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nI just thought your prepared remarks mentioned the government and working with them a lot more. So I was wondering over the last quarter or two, what's really changed, whether it was the hiring cadence, the investment required from GD, or is the government customer working closer with you to support the marine buildout?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo the.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThis is margins and companies.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI'd say there's a step up in engagement on the civilian side of the government with us on building that cadence, getting the throughput up, getting productivity increases, ensuring that we can continue to hire the workers that we have been hiring, that the wage structure is appropriate, and that the investments take us to the next level. I suspect that the next series of investments, you'll see some investment in resiliency, a lot in, again, additional productivity and throughput with increased automation, even more increased automation.\nThere's quite a bit that we've spent the last decade and recently putting in the shipyards. Then additional fixtures for additional throughput so that we can really get our pace to where it needs to be to deliver what the nation needs. And then, again, continued efforts on the part of the government to support the supply chain and get the supply chain stabilized. It's better in places, but we've got a ways to go.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America.\n\nMariana Pérez Mora\n\nDirector, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, everyone. This is Mariana Pérez Mora for Ron today.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nMariana Pérez Mora\n\nDirector, Bank of America\n\nSo I wanted to do a follow-up on combat systems. Would you mind discussing what is the pipeline of opportunities in Europe, especially because we continue to see headlines on increased commitment to build up their defenses?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo we've seen increased discussions really throughout Europe, Eastern Europe, as well as Central Europe now. Those conversations have accelerated. I think they started in earnest with the invasion of Ukraine, and they have picked up even more as each one of those governments has allocated an increasing amount of its resources to defense spending. So I would say it's across the board.\n\nMariana Pérez Mora\n\nDirector, Bank of America\n\nThank you. My follow-up is going to be on Aero. What are your expectations for, especially in this macro environment or evolving uncertainty? What are your expectations for book-to-bill on Gulfstream for the full year?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo we're close to one-to-one for the year. I think we're actually at 0.9, but with pickups. That's pretty close to one. So we continue to see that as achievable in the moment. Should that change, we'll let you know in Q2.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll move to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director in Aerospace and Defense, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Phebe, I realize you can't put precision on the tariffs. I'm going to step on the landline here.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nOh, you're right about that.\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nI know. I know. So your confidence that you alluded to in the full year outlook, is that encompassing your assessment of what you're going to see? Just want to make sure I'm correct.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWe don't think the defense guys get hit much. There will be some Gulfstream impacts, and nothing we see so far is extraordinary. But we have a long way to go. And I think a lot of the supply chains have to assimilate these changes and see the impacts to the extent that they have them on them. But that's all I can give you. If I were any more specific, the one thing I could assure you is it would be wrong, and you all would be highly irritated that I gave you a wrong number. So I'm giving you really how we see it from our foxhole moment.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director in Aerospace and Defense, Wolfe Research\n\nAll right. And then, to follow up, we talked through the call about the administration's fingerprints on the Marine business with the Shipbuilding Act and Technologies with some of their initiatives on government services. Is there anything you're seeing as it relates to your combat business and their view on the role of the Army and maybe the XM30 and M10 as being prioritized or deprioritized in the framework?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo one of the things that is a truism about Washington that is now a truism on steroids is that rumor is rampant. So I want to see what the budgets actually show. But the CR did fund Stryker and Abrams at a lesser rate. I think the Army's plan had been one full brigade of Abrams, 1/3 of a brigade of Strykers. And they cut that request by about 1/3. So we need to find a little bit more stable funding profile, particularly for the supply chain. That really perturbs the supply chain badly. There is great interest on the part of the Army, and we are working daily with them to accelerate the next generation Abrams. So we consider that a very positive step in Army recapitalization and modernization.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director in Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director in Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nI just wanted to go back to technologies, Jason or Phebe. It's interesting you mentioned engagement with the customer and that this dialogue, back-and-forth dialogue, is going on. I wondered how much are they just asking for reductions versus how much are you showing them capability that can help them gain efficiencies while adding revenue to your business? Then additionally, I'm curious how much discussion is there around contract structure and how that could impact margins, whether positively or negatively?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. Look, in short, I'd say it's all of the above. Not to mince words, they are looking for reductions across the board, and we are actively participating in that and making recommendations to help them solve the problem they're trying to solve. But to your point, there are opportunities down the road because the fact is, when you look at the types of efficiencies they're trying to drive, the type of headcount reductions they're looking for, it is absolutely the very types of things that we provide in terms of these technology solutions and digitization and so on that enable those types of reductions.\nSo there's going to be a period where it's a shorter-term conversation, and then it's going to turn to a longer-term conversation. And to your point about opportunity in that, I think, look, we talked about fixed-price/outcome-based type contracts. And again, I mentioned we're comfortable with that. We have a good bit of that in our portfolio, and that should bring an opportunity for us. The fact is, it's no different than any other contract geometry, fixed price versus cost-plus. When you take on more risk, there should be an opportunity for a little better margin, but all of it comes at a better price and a better outcome for the customer.\nI guess if I were to add one other thing to watch out for from a risk standpoint, we need to be careful from a mission perspective that if there's dueling priorities of significantly reducing workforce within the government and at the same time, on a meaningful level, insourcing this type of work to the customer, that can come at great peril. We need to be mindful of that in these conversations and make sure we don't compromise any mission capability.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director in Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nI appreciate all that detail, Jason. Just one quick one, Kim, what's your updated thinking for full-year free cash flow and net income conversion?\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nI think we're sticking with the forecast that we gave you in January at this point in time. We're obviously always trying to improve upon that, but at this point in the year, we're going to stick to that forecast.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nOkay. Operator, I think now we have time for just one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll take that question from Gautam Khanna at TD Cowen.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAerospace and Defense Senior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Thank you, guys. Jason, I wanted to just follow up on the prior question. Have you actually seen a DOGE or whatever we want to call this debook terminate contracts with GDIT? Has that happened? And if so, can you quantify what that aggregates to?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. I'm sure if you look at the public information around DOGE, they list all the contract actions that they've taken action on. And we have been a part of that. There have been some stop work orders, some partial stop work orders, and so on. In terms of impact of that, I'm not going to quantify that for the year. As I said, the outlook for the year for the business remains the same. If anything, I think I would remind you that historically, the way General Dynamics puts contract value into backlog is materially different and more conservative than most of GDIT's peers. We're very rigorous about that. And so from a color standpoint, I think I'll put it that way. But those things are going on, and it's going to be part of the conversation.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAerospace and Defense Senior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGotcha. And it's factored in. Okay. And then just to follow up on Gulfstream, Phebe, could you remind us what percentage of the pipeline of opportunities on the large cabin side are with non-US customers? A rough percentage? Is it half? Is it a quarter?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. No, it's less than half. I think it typically runs 60/40, something like that, 60 US.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nGreat. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the Q1 earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nFor additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the investor relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported Q4 earnings of $4.15 per diluted share on revenue of $13,338, operating earnings of $1,423, and net earnings of $1,148,000. As you will see, this performance and the resultant performance for the year compare quite favorably to all relevant prior periods.\nTo briefly summarize, on a quarter-over-year-ago quarter basis, revenue is up 14.3%, operating earnings are up 10.5%, net earnings are up 14.2%, and earnings per diluted share are up 14%. It is fair to say that the quarter-over-quarter results are quite strong. Sequential results are similar. Here, we beat the prior quarter's revenue by 14.3%, operating earnings by 20.5%, net earnings by 23.9%, and fully diluted EPS by 23.4%.\nThe full year is also up, a common theme. Revenue is up 12.9%, operating earnings are up 13%, net earnings are up 14.1%, and fully diluted EPS is up 13.4%. Both revenue and operating earnings were up for each of the segments led by aerospace, with revenue growth of 30.5% and with operating earnings growth of 23.9%. While we beat consensus for the year by $0.05, we did not beat our own expectations and prior guidance for reasons largely beyond our control. This leads me to a discussion of the segments.\nFirst, aerospace. The real story in aerospace is found in the continuing growth of both revenue and earnings, the continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, the overall strength of Gulfstream's service business, and the continuing growth and performance improvement at Jet Aviation. In the quarter, aerospace had revenue of $3.7 billion and earnings of $585 million. This represents a stunning 36.4% increase in revenue and a 30.3% increase in earnings on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The sequential numbers are even stronger, with a 51% increase in revenue coupled with a staggering 92% increase in operating earnings. The important point here is the dramatic increase in deliveries of in-service airplanes in the quarter, 47 versus 28 in the Q3 of 2024.\nFor the year, aerospace revenue of $11.25 billion is up 30.5%, greater than 2023. Earnings of $1.5 billion are up 23.9% over 2023. Revenue growth was driven by the delivery of 25 more aircraft than in 2023. Earnings suffered a 70 basis points margin compression from the prior year, largely driven by all the costs associated with getting the G700 certified in the early part of the year, and the unexpected costs incurred getting the G700s out the door. Nevertheless, aerospace revenue and earnings are less than we anticipated for both the quarter and the year because we did not deliver as many 700s as planned. We did, however, deliver 15 in the quarter and 30 for the year.\nYou will recall that I told you that we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. Well, we planned 15 for Q2 and delivered 11. We planned 15 to 16 for Q3 and delivered 4. In the Q4, we believed that we could deliver 27 but delivered 15. So what happened that caused us to fall short of plan? Let me identify the most important and impactful reasons and then talk about the implications of all of this for 2025.\nFirst, aircraft engines arrived significantly late to schedule. We painted the aircraft before the engines arrived. This led to a significant amount of repaint that resulted in increased cost and time spent. But more importantly, we elected to induct these aircraft into our completion centers before installing engines.This represented a significant deviation from our process and proved to be detrimental to both cost and schedule. Normally, before a green aircraft is inducted into a completion center, we run the engines and test all the plane systems under power, which typically leads to additional actions to correct any issues that might arise.\nOnce the aircraft begins its completion phase, these tests and follow-on corrections are substantially more cumbersome. So, what seemed like a rational decision at the time turned out to be quite troublesome. The good news is that most of the time-consuming aspects of this issue are behind us. We are now largely receiving engines to schedule, and quality escapes are more predictable, and appropriate fixes well-known. Second, many of the aircraft planned for delivery in the quarter had highly customized interiors, first-of-type intricacies. These intricacies are considered to be major changes for regulatory purposes.\nThis resulted in longer-than-anticipated efforts to finalize and achieve supplemental type certificates. This problem is largely behind us. Third, and maybe most important, late in the Q4, a supplier quality escape on a specific component caused the replacement of several components on each planned aircraft delivery. The supplier was fully cooperative and is providing replacement components for all of our needs, but this rework has increased the number of test flights necessary to obtain a final certificate of airworthiness for each aircraft. So the removal and replacement of these components has impacted labor costs and schedule adversely.\nWhile it had a significant impact in both the Q3 and Q4, we have largely worked our way through this problem with the cooperation of the vendor. Finally, many of the early deliveries were to buyers located in foreign countries where we were making first-time deliveries. While they recognize the FAA certification, they have a separate and sometimes extended inquiry before issuing registration. This is, in many respects, also behind us. The supply chain is now performing much better to schedule, and even though we continue to be surprised by some quality escapes, the time it takes to identify and fix these faults has significantly improved. Turning to market demand, we had a one-to-one book-to-bill in the quarter and for the year, even as aircraft deliveries increased.\nOrders were largely consistent with our internal plan. The delivery of the G700 and its performance in customer hands is driving increased demand for it, which we experienced in the quarter. After some slowing in the US during the Q2 and Q3, we continue to see improved interest across all models in both the US and Europe. Middle East activity is quite strong, and current activity in Southeast Asia and China has also improved. Interestingly, the overall number of prospects in all areas continues to increase. So, let's move on to the defense businesses. Combat Systems had revenue of $2.4 billion for the quarter, moderately more than the year-ago quarter.\nEarnings of $356 million are also up modestly on a 10 basis point operating margin improvement. Operating margin of 14.9% is quite wholesome. The sequential growth in revenue and earnings at 8.3% and 9.5%, respectively, is stronger, particularly with strength at OTS. For the full year, revenue of $9 billion is up 8.8%, and earnings of $1.3 billion are up 11.2%, resulting in a 30 basis points increase in operating margins as compared to a year ago. All in all, very nice growth profile. Combat saw robust order intake over the course of the year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.3 to 1.\nOrders came from across the portfolio with notable awards in munitions and international vehicle programs. New capacity to meet demand for artillery is coming online in our munitions business, which will drive additional munitions growth. Demand remains strong in the US and from our allies, particularly in the combat vehicle tracked and wheeled business. This, coupled with combat's strong overall backlog of nearly $17 billion, positions the group well for continued strong performance. In short, this group had a very solid year with strong revenue growth, expanded margins, durable order activity, and a strong order pipeline as we go forward. Turning to Marine Systems.\nOnce again, our shipbuilding group had strong revenue growth. Marine revenue of $4 billion is up 16.2% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class and Virginia-class construction and TAO volume drove the growth. DDG-51 revenue also increased measurably. In short, impressive growth by any standard. Operating earnings of $200 million are down 7.8% in the quarter, with a 130 basis points decrease in operating margin. Margins continue to be adversely impacted by additional delays and quality issues from the submarine supply chain. Sequentially, revenue increased 10% while earnings were down 22.5% for the reasons I've just mentioned.\nFor the full year, marine revenue of $14.3 billion is up 15.1%, and earnings of $935 million are up 7%. Certainly, a better result than Q4 taken alone. The operating metrics tell us that we have, in fact, increased our productivity to somewhat offset increased costs, but not enough. So, across the business, we have seen rapid growth of revenue and more modest growth in earnings. As I told you last quarter, although the submarine supply chain is improving in places, out-of-sequence work continues to increase our costs.\nIn addition, we have seen increased quality problems from the supply chain that have further disrupted our build plan and driven increased costs for quality control and inspection at EB. That said, we continue to drive productivity improvements and are redoubling our cost cutting by reducing overhead and increasing our planning efficiency. In addition, the Congress recently passed a Continuing Resolution that included nearly $9 billion for Columbia-class construction and $5.7 billion for Virginia-class programs. While the Columbia portion of the CR is primarily to maintain the funding plan impacted by the delay in the 2025 budget, the Virginia-class funds provide the following.\nThey allow the Navy to cover fact-of-life cost increases on the two FY24 boats and one F25 boat. They also provide funds for additional workforce development and allow us to target funding at specific productivity areas that we are working out with our customer. We are working with our customer to get this under contract as soon as possible. In addition, the Navy is continuing to push funding into the industrial base to help improve their output, timing, and quality. This effort over time will help. All of this tells us that we should see some improvement in the supply chain slowly but surely. Until then, we continue to control what we can control by increasing our own productivity and cutting costs.\nAnd lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of $3.24 billion, up 2.8% over the prior year. Operating earnings in the quarter are $319 million, up 4.6% on a margin of 9.8%, a 10 basis-point improvement over Q4 a year ago. The full-year comparisons are similar. Revenue at $13.1 billion is up 1.6%. Earnings of $1.26 billion are up 4.8% on a 30 basis-point improvement in operating margin. Both businesses finished a really good year with a strong Q4. In particular, GDIT delivered their fourth consecutive year of revenue and earnings growth, resulting in their highest-ever revenue and earnings, and their strongest operating margin over this period.\nMission Systems had a good year as well. Their focus has been on margin expansion as they transitioned from sunsetting legacy programs to new program wins. So, while their revenue was down about 2% year-over-year, earnings were up 5.5% on a 90 basis points improvement in margin. We expect 2025 to be the final year of the program transition at Mission Systems, with growth on both the top line and bottom line thereafter. Turning to orders, the group had very nice order activity for the year. Total orders for the group reached a record level of $14.7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.1 for the year.\nSimilarly, the total awards, including options and IDIQ value, were $21.8 billion. That led to an 18% increase in total potential contract value to $48.1 billion, which positions them nicely to continue on their growth trajectory. The group's win rates remain very strong in the low 80% range for the year, and their capture rate remains in the mid-60% range, both very strong for this industry. GDIT's digital accelerator investments are yielding very good results, driving almost $7.5 billion in award value in 2024 alone and a total of $10 billion in awards since they launched the program two years ago.\nLikewise, Mission Systems secured a number of marquee wins last year as a result of their investments in innovative technology, including space-ground systems, strategic recapitalization programs, and Canadian Land C4ISR systems. All in all, a strong year for the Technologies Group. This concludes my comments about the defense businesses. Let me ask Kim to provide detail on our cash performance for the quarter and the year, overall order activity and backlog, share repurchase activity, and other items. I will then come back to discuss our thoughts in 2025.\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. Let me first start with orders and backlog. Our order activity and backlog continued to be a strong story for us in 2024. We achieved an overall Book-to-bill ratio for the year of 1 to 1, while revenue grew 13%. Combat Systems and technologies led the way with Book-to-bills of 1.3 times and 1.1 times, respectively. Aerospace finished strong, resulting in a dollar-based Book-to-bill for the year of 1 times, even as Gulfstream aircraft deliveries increased over 20% and their revenue grew about 31% from the prior year. We finished 2024 with total backlog of $90.6 billion, the seventh consecutive quarter that backlog remained above $90 billion, demonstrating its durability during a period of robust growth.\nTotal estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the year at another record level of $144 billion, a 9% increase from last year. This increase was driven by our technology segment as it continued to capture major opportunities, including record awards at GDIT. Turning now to our cash performance. As expected, the Q4 was a strong cash quarter with operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, which brings us to $4.1 billion of operating cash flow for the year. In the quarter, Combat Systems had particularly strong cash generation, while aerospace and technologies had solid quarters as well. We have said repeatedly that we strive for cash conversion at or around 100%.\nFor 2024, our free cash flow was $3.2 billion, a cash conversion rate of 85%. Recall that 2023's free cash flow was 115% and that the 2022 through 2024 average was 100%. We experienced working capital growth in inventories at Gulfstream due to delayed deliveries and as production continued to ramp up.Another reason for working capital growth is that two of our fastest-growing defense businesses, EB and OTS, had customer-funded material purchases on undefinitized contracts. The cash associated with the unbilled profit is not collected until the contract is definitized.\nWe expect working capital will continue to build in 2025 and unwind in 2026, although it could be earlier. Looking next at capital deployment, capital expenditures in the Q4 were $355 million, which adds up to $916 million for the full year. At 1.9% of sales, full-year capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. We paid $389 million in dividends in the Q4, bringing the full year to $1.5 billion. We also repurchased 4.8 million shares of our stock in the quarter for $1.3 billion. So we finished the year with 5.4 million shares repurchased for $1.5 billion at an average price of $277 per share.\nIn total for the year, it is important to note that approximately 95% of our free cash flow was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We repaid $500 million of maturing notes in the Q4 and ended the year with a cash balance of $1.7 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.1 billion, down approximately $300 million from last year. We also contributed $73 million to our pension plans. Our net interest expense in the Q4 was $76 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $324 million. That compares to $78 million and $343 million in the respective 2023 periods.\nTurning to 2025, while 100% of on-average cash conversion has been our goal, we may come in lighter between 80% and 85% for several reasons. While we expect CapEx and interest expense to be relatively flat, we have a 27th pay period at a couple of our businesses, which requires an additional $175 million this year. As I noted earlier, working capital will continue to build at least through part of the year. As far as capital deployment goes, we will continue to fund the dividend and buy shares when appropriate. We also have $1.5 billion of debt maturing in the Q2, the disposition of which we will address then.\nFinally, our cash taxes and pension contributions are expected to increase. Turning now to income taxes. Our 2024 full-year rate ended up at 16.7%. Looking ahead to 2025, we expect the full-year effective tax rate to increase to around 17.5%. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Kim. So let me provide our operating forecast for 2025 with some color around our outlook for each business group and then the company-wide roll-up. In 2025, we expect aerospace revenue around $12.65 billion, up around $1.4 billion over 2024. Operating margin is expected to be up 70 basis points to 13.7%. This should result in an 18.5% increase in earnings, up between $270 to $275 million. Gulfstream deliveries will be 150 materially over the 136 delivered in 2024.\nAs I just noted, we anticipate a 13.7% operating margin for the year, quite a bit stronger in Q1, but weaker in Q2 and Q3, followed by a strong Q4. Given the delivery challenges we have had with the G700s in 2024, we have taken a less aggressive planning posture in 2025. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be up slightly to about $9.1 billion, coupled with a 30 basis points improvement in operating margin of 14.5%. This should lead to improved earnings, 3.5% to 4% better than in 2024. As I noted earlier, the Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey. It will continue in 2025, albeit at a slightly lower rate.\nOur outlook for this year anticipates revenue of around $15 billion, with operating margin improvement to 6.8%, which should result in a 10% or better improvement in earnings in 2025. In technologies, 2025 revenue is expected to be $13.5 billion. Within the group, GDIT will be up low single digits, and Mission Systems will be slightly down, less than 0.5%. Operating margins are expected to decrease about 40 basis points, about 9.2%. We continue to see long-term single-digit growth from the group and continued industry-leading margins. So for 2025 company-wide, we expect to see revenue of approximately $50.3 billion, an increase of around 5.5%. We anticipate margin of 10.3%, up 20 basis points from 2024.\nAll of this rolls up to an EPS forecast around $14.80, with a reasonable range of $14.75 to $14.85. None of this contemplates or includes the use of capital for share repurchases. On a quarter basis, if one were to assume an average of $3.70 per quarter, the Q1 would be off $0.20, the Q2 off $0.40, the Q3 right on the number, and the fourth up $0.60. To wrap up, as we go into 2025, we feel very good about our business and the prospects for the year. We also have some very good opportunities across the business to improve operating margins and experience some additional growth. Simply, we need to execute, and we will be laser-focused on operations. Nicole, back to you.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. As a reminder to ask a question, please press star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. As stated, in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Our first question comes from Ronald Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, can you hear me okay?\n\nOperator\n\nYeah. Good morning, Ronald.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nYeah, perfect. Yeah, good morning. Good morning. So just maybe following up on the G700 stuff, I would imagine there'd be a bunch of questions on this. Is there any impact on the cert and delivery of G800? And do you get any compensation from the suppliers on the delay? Because I would imagine it frustrated some customers.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo taking in the inverse order, we have worked out with our suppliers some consideration, but not anything that I think is too material. But let's talk about the 800. So we expect the 800 certification sometime in the first half. And we think we have worked our way through the most significant problems that we experienced on the 700. Remember, the commonality of parts is almost identical between the 800 and the 700. So we think the learning that we achieved on the 700 will be very advantageous on the 800. And our objective here is to deliver fewer, have expectations to deliver fewer G800s than we did G700s.\nSo think about it this way. For 2025, we're thinking about a combination of G650s and G800s. It's about equal to, give or take, a few airplanes, the number of G650s we delivered. So we think a lot of the challenges are behind us.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Got it. And if I can, just one quick follow-up. Yesterday, there was a lot of turbulence in terms of army contracts. I mean, there were contracts that were turned off. They were turned back on at the end of the day. How do you think about running your business in an environment where it's kind of this volatile?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, I think it's a good lesson not to react to rumors and to react to implemented reality when it happens. So there's a lot swirling, and we have to see how all of that plays out and manifests itself in defense actions and defense program. But I think that was a good teaching example for those outside the typical kind of Washington swirl.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDouglas Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nDouglas Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nOn combat, the demand has been very strong, particularly on the munitions side. Can you comment a little bit about how you're seeing the trajectory ahead on vehicles, both US and international?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo our vehicle demand continues pretty strongly, both internationally and within the US. We're executing on new programs. We're continuing to execute on our existing programs. That's true for both wheeled and track vehicles internationally and, again, in the US. And FMS continues to be a fairly significant driver of demand, again, both on the wheeled and the tracked combat vehicle side. So I will note that the Stryker program in 2025 was underfunded, and we'll work with the customer and the Hill to get a more rational funding profile. But all in all, pretty strong demand. Go ahead.\n\nDouglas Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nYeah. And then on Marine, you talked about some additional funding, certainly for Columbia-class. There's been money coming in for infrastructure. But when trying to resolve the issues there that you face around supply chain, inflation costs, when the Navy provides more money, does the responsibility then go to you to resolve a very complex infrastructure problem, or are there things that the Navy should be doing more to address, I would say, both the inflation issues and the whole broad supply chain?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, let's first get a predicate correct. Our infrastructure is not the issue. We have a very robust, mature, and advanced infrastructure. The issue has been within the industrial supply chain. And as you quite rightly note, inflation has been a major determinant of some of these fact-of-life changes that impacted the entirety of the industrial base and driven price increases. We also had demographic changes. We had a generation of workers retire in greater numbers, and sooner than we had anticipated, being replaced by a demographic age cohort that is a little less, and significantly less in terms of numbers.\nThat said, we've worked through that. About a decade ago, we started training programs within the Marine Group, and that's 12 years ago. And those programs are increasingly mature, and we've been able to get the workers that we've needed. So the Navy and the Congress have been quite proactive in getting funding out to the industrial base to help stabilize. In fact, we've seen some improvement in some areas. In missile tubes and castings, you've seen a nice improvement in their ability to deliver on time and quality products.\nThat still needs to permeate the entirety of the industrial base, where we have continued to see delays and quality escapes, all of which drive cost growths. I think the Navy has done quite a bit in addressing the industrial base challenges. The CR funding helps address the cost challenges on the FY 2024 boats and funds the FY 2025 boat, as well as some selected productivity improvements. That's a help. There still remains a hole in the budget driven by these fact-of-life changes that was not addressed and needs to be addressed going forward. So I hope that helps you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Gautam Khanna from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes. Good morning. Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nI was wondering if you could talk about the mechanics of how the SARS funding actually gets to General Dynamics. I'm just like, is it applied to the boats that are under negotiation now?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, let's back up a minute. Hold on a sec. I don't mean to interrupt you, but there are no specific contracting actions in effect. What you refer to was one of those under consideration by the previous administration. It is not in effect. What you see now are two things. One, the CR funding that, as I noted in my remarks, addresses the Virginia-class and Columbia. And then you have industrial-based funding that's been going on for some time that goes right into the industrial base. So those are two different elements. Does that help?\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nIt does. And on the latter, I'm curious, how does that actually flow to General Dynamics? What is the mechanism for that money getting to the Navy?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, the industrial-based funding goes into the industrial base, not into GD, other than we may execute contracts with respect to that for the Navy. So there's a distinction between the shipyard and the industrial base, if that helps.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nPhebe, I assume the margins on lot one and two for G700 were quite a bit lower than what you had originally expected, given everything you talked about.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYes. We've been pretty clear about that.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nRight. And so in that context, I was wondering if you could perhaps update us on the margin step-ups for lots three and four, and whether it's still the 600 basis points that you talked about a few quarters ago. Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYes, it is. And there's room for improvement beyond lot three.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then can you go into a bit more detail on what drove the margin strength at Aerospace this quarter, particularly given the challenges you outlined in your prepared remarks?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, the Aerospace Group is quite a large group, and there are always, in any given quarter, a lot of moving parts. The extent to which service, the mix of service and timing on service, special mission, and how much gasoline we pump. I mean, this is a very large group. So there's lots of margin issues or margin factors and drivers in any given quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Phebe. Thank you for the time. Maybe a big-picture question, just given the new administration. We touched upon it a little bit, but all your segments hit on it with Marine and DOGE within technology, and even tariffs within aerospace. I was wondering if you could just maybe touch upon each of it and how you think about the trajectory and any changes in profitability in your franchises.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, I think with any change in administration, there is always new direction, and we will address the changes here this time in the same way that we have in other instances, and that's to maintain our agility. What does agility really mean? It means accurate and quick decision-making in the moment. With respect to the DOGE, I think any actions that improve the efficiency and cost structure of organizations is a good thing, and we would embrace that. I think as we think through the threat, as you all know, I've argued for a long time that defense spending is threat-driven, and the threat has, if anything, increased.\nSo, we will work with our customer on a going-forward basis and ensure that we're meeting their demand for goods, material, and services in those areas where they think it's the greatest threat. I think that most of our programs are very well-positioned for the modern fight. So, we look forward to going forward and think we're in pretty good position.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nMaybe if I could just follow up on Marine profitability, any sort of quantification you could provide on just the floor, just given the supply chain has consistently lagged, even though you've been up to par?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI think that we've seen, as I said, some stabilization. We need a ways to go. The money that the Navy has been pumping into the industrial base will help over time. I think the CR will certainly help in the moment, but we need additional funding in order to execute the program of record. That's been pretty well-documented by the Navy and the Congress, frankly. So we'll continue to manage our margin performance as best we can. We have a number of, as you all know, we've talked about before, a number of issues that drive our costs and drive them up.\nAnd to the extent that we have reduced costs and improved productivity, we'll continue to do so. We've done a pretty good job there, but not enough to offset the cost impacts. We're going to continue to manage those costs and drive them down and improve our productivity as well. So all of that, again, will go help offset and cover some of the cost increases that may yet occur. We've factored into our thinking known risks, but it's the unknown unknowns that are always out there. And as I say, over time, we should see some real stabilization within the supply chain, but it's going to take a bit of time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, Myles.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for the color on the deliveries on the 700. I'm curious, though. It seems like those causes are the same as what we talked about in Q3. So just from a trajectory perspective, what was evolving in Q4 that you're now feeling much more comfortable about than just progressing?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. I think one of the things that we did that we didn't identify in Q3 was the induction of the airplanes into delivery or into completions without the engines. That was a significant factor. And the implications of that didn't become clear until a bit later. But some of this is learning. In retrospect, you might have done something a little different. But on a going-forward basis, we've got a lot of that behind us. And from a production point of view, we're in regular order. On the completion side, we're getting there, but we're just not there yet. But we're getting there. And by the way, we factored all that thinking into our 2025 guidance.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. I was going to add a follow-up there. So I think originally you intended 50 deliveries of the 700 in 2025. And obviously, it doesn't sound like you've changed, excuse me, in 2024. It doesn't sound like you've changed the manufacturing side of the house. And so I guess tying it to Nicole's comment on working capital pressure, I was expecting a little bit of working capital relief at aerospace. I guess I should take it that there was a buildup of EB and OTS that more than offsets it. Is that correct, Nicole?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo we had some, and not to pick nits, but Kim is our CFO.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, my God. I'm so sorry.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI'm sure she takes no offense on that. In fact, you can call any of us any of our names. We'll respond accordingly. But yeah, we'll continue to have a little bit of working capital buildup at Gulfstream. As we remember, we've got the 800 and the 400 in their certification process. And then that will begin to unwind at the end of 2025, maybe a little bit earlier. And then a little bit of working capital increases, as Kim noted, in combat and at Electric Boat. But again, to sanitize some of those contracts, and that'll begin to unwind.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Mikus from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nVP of Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nVP of Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nQuick question on the inflation pressures, particularly at Marine. Of the bids that you submitted for fixed-price contracts at all your defense businesses over the past couple of years, what percentage of those included EPA clauses or some sort of language to protect you from future inflationary pressures?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, all of our, just with respect to the Marine Group, all of our contracts have always included EPA clauses. It's just that the level of inflation was not contemplated. The growth in inflation was not contemplated at the time these contracts were signed. And frankly, I think when you fund defense at a 1% increase and inflation is considerably higher than that, that's a real decrease. So you're likely to see some of those pressures. But we had contract protection, not just sufficient to cover the significant cost increases, which on some material was 37%. So, these are real fact-of-life changes that have challenged the out years, and they need to be addressed.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nVP of Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nOkay. And then thinking about aerospace, I think in August there was an announcement that Gulfstream is going to spend $370 million for a new plant in Mexicali. So I'm just wondering, are you considering ramping up some of your material purchases or production that happens in Mexico or Canada to preempt any potential tariffs?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo look, we'll deal with that when it comes and how it comes. But we have long-term plans in place. We are heavily in the United States, as you well know, in our manufacturing facilities. But we will deal with any of the impacts of governmental policy as they occur, as we always have.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nWell, I wanted to ask about aerospace. The prior sort of long-term outlook was for up to about 170 deliveries. Do we think about the 150 this year? How much of that is sort of due to supply constraint and the waiting for certification of the G800? And how do you think about the path from here? And kind of likewise, on margins, there was an expectation to be at least in the mid-teens or higher. Is there any way to kind of quantify the extra cost, the supply chain challenges that are dragging on this year, and kind of how those can go away?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, we can certainly quantify the cost, and I think those have been reflected in our margin performance. Look, we have the capacity to build more, but our planning needs to be prudent and needs to reflect the reality of the supply chain. We've taken, as I noted in my remarks, a bit more of a conservative approach this year to deliveries so that we better match supply chain cadence, which the cadence is pretty good.\nWe just need to continue to monitor for quality escapes, which drives both time and cost at Gulfstream because we have more inspectors, more QA inspectors, and more test folks on the floor as well as flyaway teams. So until we get improvement in that area, I think we have planned accordingly. Margins will build and build nicely at aerospace. We've talked about that over the years and all the reasons for that, the commonality of parts, the new manufacturing facilities, our use of AI and digital engineering in our manufacturing and production facilities. So I'm very confident that we will drive margin performance going forward.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thanks. And then just in technologies, what's driving the year-on-year margin pressure?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo two things. So think about it this way. Mission Systems is going to stay relatively flat this year as it finishes its transition from legacy programs to new programs, and the growth will be at GDIT. So GDIT's businesses tend to carry a little lower margins. Plus, we have a mix shift at GDIT with some mature programs retiring and some newer programs coming online. So it's nothing really but a timing and mix issue. It signifies nothing other than that.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Okay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHi.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning. Morning. Hi, Phebe. What is the book-to-bill assumption for aerospace embedded within your comments around working capital this year?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWe have a one-to-one book-to-bill as our assumption going forward.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. And then if you could just clarify the comment on the 650 versus the 800. I wasn't exactly clear what you were saying there in terms of deliveries. How many 650s do you actually have left to deliver at this point?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI don't have the exact number, but we're done by mid-year. So the comment, what I was trying to say, is the combination of the 800 and the 650s. Remember, the 800 is a replacement for the 650. The combination of those two platforms will equal about the 650 deliveries this year, give or take a few airplanes.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGot it. Roughly. Okay. Thanks for that. And then the last one, the 400 timeline on cert there, and are you including any 400 deliveries in your 150 forecast for this year? Thanks.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nNo, we're not. And the 400 will come, obviously, after the 800.But as you all know, as I said before, I'm not sticking my finger into the light socket. And with any detail on when we're getting certification, that's beyond our control. But both programs are going very nicely.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nSo Julianna, I think we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our last question will come from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nPhebe, a couple of quick ones on combat. First of all, with the new US administration, do you think there's going to be some more flexibility on allowing exports to various parts of the world? And then secondly, with regard to Europe, are you seeing any impact from the local political desire to buy more equipment locally? Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, remember, our business is domiciled in Europe. So we haven't really seen any changes in European buying habits. We have, over the last few years, as you all know, seen an increase in spending. I think certainly our expectations are that increases. Your first question was about exports. Your line's a little rough. Can you say that? Repeat that first part again?\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nYeah. Sure. It's with regard to other parts of the world, if this new US administration may be more flexible in allowing or even encouraging exports to other parts of the world.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, I think that this administration has been quite clear that it intends to export, and we're certainly able and willing to support that and have in the past. We'll look forward to that.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nAll right. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the Q4 earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNicole M. Shelton\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.\nOn the call today are Phebe Novakovic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, General Dynamics Corp.\n\nThank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share on revenue of $11.98 billion, operating earnings of $1.16 billion and net income of $905 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our 4 business segments compared to the year ago quarter. Across the company, revenue increased a strong 18%, with a 51% increase in our Aerospace segment and a 10% increase across our defense units, strong growth by any standard.\nImportantly, operating earnings of $1.16 billion are up almost $200 million or 20.2%, demonstrating solid operating leverage. Similarly, net earnings are up 21.6% and earnings per share up 21% over the year ago quarter. You will note, we missed Street EPS consensus by $0.02 due entirely to the slip of 4 G700 deliveries from the last week in the quarter to the beginning Q3. One has since been delivered, 3 are imminent. From a different perspective, the sequential comparisons are also quite favorable. Revenue was up $1.2 billion and operating earnings are up $120 million on steady margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $22.7 billion is up $2.67 billion or 13.3% over last year's first half. Operating earnings of nearly $2.2 billion are up 15.4%. Net earnings of $1.7 billion are up 15.6% despite a higher provision for income taxes.\nIn a few minutes, our CFO, Kim Kuryea, will provide you with free cash flow for the first half and remainder of the year, our strong continued order activity and backlog, as well as some additional relevant financial information. But first, I will take you through each of the segments. We'll start with Aerospace. Let me give you some comparative numbers that will show the front end of a tremendous growth surge for Aerospace that will progress favorably throughout the year. Then I will attempt to put all of this in some reasonable perspective for you.\nAerospace had revenue of $2.94 billion and operating earnings of $319 million with a 10.9% operating margin. Revenue is $987 million more than last year's second quarter, a remarkable 51% increase. The revenue increase was driven by additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher service revenue. We delivered 37 aircraft, including 11 newly certified G700s in the quarter. This is 4 fewer than we expected to deliver, but more about that in a minute. Operating earnings of $319 million are up $83 million, 35% over the year ago quarter. The 10.9% operating margin was 120 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by G700 deliveries that carried more than expected costs from 3 things: First, retrofit; second, out-of-station work related to the late arrival of parts; and three, the extended certification period. This cost burden will affect 20 lot 1 aircraft, which includes 5 test aircraft that will not deliver this year. So we are through the lot 1 cost burden for this year within the next 4 deliveries.\nThe good news is that margins on the G700 are expected to increase by 600 to 700 basis points in lot 2 and by a similar increment in lot 3. By the time we reach lot 3 production and deliveries, we will have reached a steady state in terms of productivity and predictability. A few comments on predictability. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last 3 quarters of the year. But we planned 15 for Q2 and deliver 11. So much for predictability. We actually had the remaining 4 completed and ready to go, but could not get through the preflight delivery testing in time. You might be surprised to learn that each G700 has flown about 30 hours of tests before delivery. 2 of the planes also needed a supplemental type certificate because of a very different cabin configuration. That wasn't done by the end of the quarter.\nAll right, back to some numerical comparisons. The sequential numbers are equally impressive. Revenue is up $856 million, a strong 41% increase, and operating earnings are up $64 million, about 25%, affected by 130 basis point degradation in operating margins for the reason I just mentioned a moment ago. You will see much stronger operating margins in the third quarter, followed by even better operating margin and related earnings in the fourth quarter. Separately, we still expect to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. Look for about 16 in the third quarter and 23 to 25 in the fourth quarter. From an orders perspective, we had a respectable quarter at 0.9:1 book-to-bill in dollar terms. There is strong interest in a fair pipeline across the product mix.\nAs I noted last quarter, bringing transactions to close has elongated somewhat, as there is some caution while customers digest the impact of geopolitical events in general and the U.S. presidential election in particular. The United States remains our strongest market, but the yield is improving. The Middle East shows very strong potential. And just very recently, we have seen some improvement in China. The interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at the end of the year suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nWe are pleased to have both G700 FAA and EASA certifications behind us. The Aerospace comparative revenue and earnings numbers in the quarter are very good by any reasonable standard but still behind consensus, largely attributable to deliveries that did not make it to the wire. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter. It is handling the rapid increase in deliveries and revenue in a methodical and disciplined fashion. We look forward to a powerful second half with increasing revenue and earnings quarter-over-quarter as we forecasted at the end of last quarter.\nMoving to the defense business as a collective. We once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. Let me walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of almost $2.3 billion, up 19% over the year-ago quarter, with growth at each of the 3 business units. Earnings of $313 million are up almost 25%, and margins at 13.7% represent a 70 basis point increase over the Q2 last year. In short, very strong operating performance from Combat Systems.\nThe increased revenue came from facilities expansion and artillery work in our ammo business, coupled with increases in international tank and wheeled vehicle sales and U.S. Army programs of record. Each of the businesses increased earnings nicely, with particularly strong operating leverage in our international vehicle business. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 8.8% and earnings rose 11%. Year-to-date, revenue of about $4.4 billion is up 19.3% and earnings of $595 million are up almost $100 million, or 20%. Combat saw robust order intake with over $3.4 billion awarded in Q2, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio, ranging from ammunition to main battle tanks for the U.S. Army and [ wheeled ] vehicles for an international customer. Demand remained steady, particularly for the Abrams main battle tank and international wheeled vehicles. We expect demand for ammo to continue to rise for some time to come as we rapidly increase production of our artillery shells and components. All in all, a very strong growth and performance quarter for Combat Systems.\nTurning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.45 billion is up $394 million, almost 13% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, while Virginia-class and DDG-51 revenue also increased nicely. Operating earnings are $245 million, up $10 million over the year ago quarter with a 60 basis point decrease in operating margin. Margins were impacted by continued delays to EB from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improvement in DDG-51 performance of Bath and continued steady performance at NASSCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 3.7% and earnings improved 5.6% in Q2, driven by volume at EB, as we saw some quarter-over-quarter improvement in supply chain deliveries to the yard and continued positive performance at NASSCO. Year-to-date, Marine revenue of $6.8 billion is up 12.1% and earnings of $477 million are up 7%.\nAs I noted a moment ago, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be impacted by late deliveries from the supply chain, which both delay schedule and impacts costs. At a sequence work on multi-ton modules is time-consuming and expensive. Our strategy, as you know, has been to increase our productivity to somewhat offset that impact. To that end, throughput, a significant measure of productivity, continues to improve, hiring is good and attrition is lower, so all good signs.\nIn summary, we are starting to see some momentum build in our shipyards to meet the delivery and repair requirements of our customer, the U.S. Navy. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations.\nFinally, Technologies. The group had another good quarter with revenue of nearly $3.3 billion, up 2.5% over the year-ago quarter and operating earnings of $320 million, up 13.1% on a 90 basis point improvement in margin. This nice improvement in operating performance was across both businesses. GDIT margins increased 40 basis points, emission systems margins were up 130 basis points as they continue to recover from supply chain impacts experienced in 2023 and before. Sequentially, revenue was up $81 million or 2.5% and operating earnings are up 8.5% on a 50 basis point improvement in margin. And the story is much the same for the year-to-date with revenue of $6.5 billion, up about 1%, and operating earnings of $615 million, up 5.7% against the first 6 months of last year. As a result, margins for the group were up 40 basis points year-to-date to 9.4%.\nSo all relevant comparisons this quarter show revenue and earnings growth and a margin expansion of both businesses, positioning them well going forward. In short, GDIT is holding its industry-leading margins while consistently delivering year-over-year growth, while Mission Systems is delivering nice margin expansion as it transitions from sunsetting legacy programs. The group received $3.3 billion in orders in the quarter, bringing the total of $7.2 billion for the first 6 months. That results in a book-to-bill for the group of 1.0 for the quarter and 1.1 for the year-to-date. Total awards for the group in the first half were up 30% compared with the first 6 months of 2023. This is on the strength of win rates consistently around 80% for the group and capture rates at roughly 65%, both very strong for this industry.\nBacklog was down slightly from the end of the first quarter due to the removal of backlog associated with an international divestiture in the quarter, but was up almost $200 million from a year ago. As importantly, the qualified pipeline remains very robust at over $120 billion. So the group is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory. Let me now turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Kuryea\n\nVice President & Controller, General Dynamics Corp.\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective at $10 billion, with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.8:1 for the company. This was achieved in the quarter when revenue grew 18% over last year, and there were no significant shipbuilding contracts awarded. Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 0.9:1, while revenue grew over 40% sequentially with the initial deliveries of the G700. On the defense side of the business, Combat Systems did particularly well with a book-to-bill of 1.5:1, and Technologies was 1:1. We ended the quarter with backlog of $91.3 billion, essentially even with where we were a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at nearly $130 billion.\nTurning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $814 million of operating cash flow. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $613 million for the quarter, yielding a cash conversion rate of 68%. Technologies led the segments with strong cash flow generation in the quarter. When you consider the free cash flow through the first half of 2024, we are slightly positive at $176 million and about $250 million ahead of what we had planned. After the planned slow start in the first half, we expect significant second half growth. With the majority of the cash generated in the fourth quarter, we are still planning a cash conversion rate around 100% for the year.\nSo you may be wondering what's driving cash to be so backloaded this year. It's apparent from our balance sheet that we have been building up working capital in the first half of the year, which we expect to substantially unwind in the second half. One obvious driver of this is Gulfstream with the ramp-up for the certification and deliveries of the G700. The planned G700 deliveries in the second half are significant, which will reduce working capital. Another large contributor to the growth in working capital has been Combat Systems. They have several programs that pay at delivery. Thus, we are buying material in the first half of the year that results in product deliveries and cash in the second half of the year.\nCombat is also subject to the timing of deposits on international programs, and the first half of the year has been a period of liquidating deposits received in prior periods. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $201 million or 1.7% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year and slightly above 2% of sales when the year wraps up. Also in the quarter, we paid $389 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 119,000 shares of stock for $34 million. Through the first half, we repurchased only a modest number of shares for a total of $139 million, driven largely by our 2024 cash profile.\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.4 billion and a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down over $300 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed-rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $84 million compared to $89 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $166 million, down from $180 million for the same period in 2023 on lower debt balances. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $320 million.\nFinally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 17%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 17.2%. This rate is a little lower than our outlook for the full year, which remains around 17.5%. For the second half of the year, we expect the rate to be lower in the third quarter and then a bit higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, General Dynamics Corp.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Kim. Let me move on to give you updated forecast for the year. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we are sticking with our same earnings estimate, but we'll get there with higher revenue and about a 100 basis point drop in margins for all the reasons I mentioned to you a few minutes ago. We are still holding to our delivery estimate of about 160 airplanes.\nWith respect to the defense businesses, Combat will have revenue of about $200 million higher than previously projected as a result of continued demand. So look for total revenue of about $8.7 billion. Margin should be about the same. All in, operating earnings will be up $30 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $1 billion of Electric Boat and somewhat at Bath. So we will have annual revenue between $13.4 billion and $13.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.4%, with operating earnings up around $45 million over the January forecast.\nFor Technologies, we are not changing our earlier guidance to you. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue up about $2 billion, with overall margins down about 30 basis points. So total revenue of $47.8 billion to $48.2 billion, and operating earnings up modestly. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of $14.40 to $14.50, $0.05 over prior guidance. I will note that normally, this time of year, we have solid insight into revenue and margin. In this growth environment, the upside has been difficult to predict with equal clarity. Should anything materially change in Q3, I will give you another credit guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions.\n\nNicole M. Shelton\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask 1 question and 1 follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode, and after the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one a second time. Please note this event is being recorded, and I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Operator, and Good Morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Q1 2024 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kim Kureya, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.88 per diluted share on revenue of $10.7 billion, operating earnings of $1.36 billion, and net earnings of $799 million. These results compare quite favorably to the year-ago quarter. Revenue is up 8.6% against the Q1 last year. Operating earnings are up 10.4%. Net earnings are up 9.5%. As a result, earnings per diluted share are up $0.24, or 9.1%, more than the year-ago quarter.\nThe operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, a 20 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. Overall, these numbers represent a very strong quarter and a good start to 2024. However, we fell below our own expectations for the quarter and below analyst consensus, which is predicated, at least in part, on our forecast.\nThe rather obvious explanation is that we forecast 15 to 17 G700 deliveries in the quarter, which did not happen. We received FAA certification for the G700 at the very end of the quarter, too late to make any G700 deliveries. This obviously impacted revenue and earnings in the aerospace group in the quarter. The good news is that we now have certification, and the delay in deliveries does not change our outlook for the year. Gulfstream still plans to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year, so our aerospace forecast for the year remains unchanged. I'll give you a little more color on this later in my remarks. Other good news, as you can see, was strong performance across the defense portfolio. In short, we performed very well in the quarter over those things within our control.\nAt this point, let me ask Kim Kuryea, our CFO, to provide details on our order activity, solid backlog, and cash activity before I come back with segment observations.\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders and backlog. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective, with an overall book-to-bill ratio of one to one for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the combat systems group, with a book-to-bill of 1.6 to one, and in the aerospace and technology segment, which each had a book-to-bill of 1.2 to one. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $93.7 billion, up slightly from year-end and up 4% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at approximately $134 billion, up 1.5% from year-end.\nTurning to our cash performance for the quarter, we had an expected slow start to the year, absent the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700 and continued G700 inventory build. So let's start with technologies. We continued to see strong cash performance from that group in the quarter. As anticipated, combat systems and marine systems both built working capital in the quarter based on their unique mix of contract timing versus expected payments. Finally, moving to aerospace, the lack of G700 deliveries drove us to use cash in the quarter. As a result, our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $437 million. Since all of what I described is timing-related, we still have an expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate around 100%.\nWe expect most of the negative free cash flow to reverse in the Q2, followed by substantially improving free cash flow in each of the Q3 and Q4. Now to discuss our capital deployment activities. Capital expenditures were $159 million, or 1.5% of sales, in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year, as we anticipate spending between 2 and 2.5% of revenue on CapEx this year. Over 50% of that expected spend will be for infrastructure at our three shipyards, as we continue to invest to support the Navy's submarine and shipbuilding plan. Also, in the quarter, we paid $361 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 390,000 shares of stock for $105 million at just under $269 per share.\nWhen you add it all up, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of around $1 billion and a net debt position of $8.2 billion. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million, compared with $91 million for the same quarter last year. The reduction in interest expense was attributed to our lower debt balances. Finally, turning to income taxes, we had a 17.5% effective tax rate in the quarter, right in line with our full-year guidance, which reflects higher taxes on foreign earnings. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Kim. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace did very well in the absence of the G700 deliveries. It had revenue of $2.1 billion and operating earnings of $255 million, with a 12.2% operating margin.\nRevenue is $192 million more than last year's Q1, a 10.1% increase. To give you a little detail here, the increase was driven by an increase in new aircraft deliveries and an increase in services at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation, partially offset by significantly lower special mission aircraft activity, which is always lumpy. The 24 deliveries in the quarter are fewer than planned, but three more than the year-ago quarter. The mix in the quarter favored large cabin and the 650 in particular, which helped both revenue and earnings. Operating earnings of $255 million are up 26 million over last year's first quarter, an 11.4% increase. Earnings on both new aircraft and aircraft services enjoyed good increases, offset in part by lower earnings on special mission, higher G&A, and net R&D.\nWhile Gulfstream will continue to experience part shortages that cause significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient, the supply chain is clearly improving and much more predictable. As is now apparent, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in 2024. The first 20 to be delivered are fully built, and deliveries have begun. By the end of this month, the next seven to eight will be ready. We plan to deliver these 50 to 52 planes over the quarters in relatively even numbers, with improving margins quarter-over-quarter as we go along. The first 20, what we call the Lot 1, carry some cost and retrofit burden that will not affect subsequent aircraft deliveries. So expect margins in the Q2 to be similar to the Q1, with significant improvement in Q3 and Q4.\nAerospace had a decent quarter from an orders perspective, with a book-to-bill of 1.2 to one in dollar terms. Sales activity and customer interest is evident this quarter, but concerns over persistent inflation and monetary policy in the US, together with concerns about conflict in the Middle East, have slowed the consummation of transactions to some degree. It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the demand we see is fleet replenishment for corporations. These multi-aircraft deals usually proceed at a slower pace.\nThe G800 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacturing, and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of G800 for nine months after the G700 certification, although I'm increasingly reluctant to give estimates about these things that are ultimately out of our control. In short, the aerospace team had a good quarter.\nG700 FAA certification is in the rearview mirror, and we hope EASA certification is hard on its heels. We expect nicely improving margins, particularly in the second half. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $2.1 billion, up almost 20% over the year-ago quarter. Earnings of $282 million are up 15.1%. Margins at 13.4% are down 60 basis points over the year-ago quarter. It is interesting to observe that this very strong increase in revenue is in comparison to last year's Q1, which enjoyed a 5% increase over 2022. We saw increased revenue performance at each of the three businesses. The increase came from higher volume on new international tank programs, higher artillery program volume, and higher volume on Piranha programs and bridges. We also experienced very strong order performance.\nOrders in the quarter drove total backlog to $15.6 billion, up $1.5 billion from this time the year-ago quarter. Demand for combat systems and products continues to increase, particularly in Europe and in some lines of business in the US. Orders for wheeled and track combat vehicles are up significantly, reflecting the heightened threat environment. In addition to several new combat vehicle starts, demand for Abrams also continues. We've seen tank orders from new users, and a number of countries will be introducing Abrams into their combat fleets for the first time. Since Q1 last year, we have received almost $1 billion in orders from both US allies through FMS and the US Army. In the US, we are rapidly increasing ammunition production with the opening of our Texas facility, which will increase current 155-millimeter ammo capacity by 83%.\nAs the year goes on, we will continue to work with our Army customer to further increase ammo capacity to meet their requirements. Turning to marine systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me repeat the recent history that I gave you last year at this time with respect to growth in this decade. The Q1 of 2020 was up 9.1% against Q1 of 2019. Q1 2021 was up 10.6% over Q1 2020. Q1 2022 was up 6.8% over Q1 2021. Q1 2023 was up 12.9% over Q1 2022.\nFinally, this quarter at $3.3 billion is up 11.3% over Q1 2023. This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. However, growth ramps of this character bring with them supply chain and operation issues that are challenging. This particular quarter's growth was almost exclusively Columbia-class construction.\nOperating earnings are $232 million in the quarter, up 10% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin is basically the same as last year's quarter. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. As we have talked about on previous calls, the story at the Marine Systems is efficiently managing the growth propelled by the US Navy's need for ships, particularly submarines. As a labor-intensive, heavy manufacturing industry, the shipbuilding industrial base was hit hard by the demographic impacts of COVID.\nThis, coupled with a number of sole-source suppliers of highly complex components, has made it difficult for the industrial base to keep pace with increasing demand. The significant financial investments we have made in our shipyards over the last 12 years, particularly at Electric Boat, have mitigated the impact on us, but we are still hit by schedule and quality problems in the supply chain.\nOur job is to minimize the efficiency and schedule impacts of late material by increasing our throughput. We are doing that each and every quarter. In Q1 alone, our productivity increased 11%, but there is more to do. Finally, the Navy's investment in the supply chain has helped and will continue to help as we move forward. For technologies, we're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion is down less than 1% from the prior year, but up 2% over the Q4 of last year, and modestly ahead of our expectation for the start of the year. Operating earnings of $295 million are consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%. As we have previously discussed, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume.\nThe group received $4 billion in orders during the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 to one. Both businesses experienced strong order activity. In GDIT's case, the highest book-to-bill since mid-2019. This led to a total backlog of $13.5 billion, an increase of over 5% from the year ago, and a total estimated contract value of $42.7 billion. The story in Technologies has wanted steady growth, particularly at GDIT, and increasingly at Mission Systems as they transition from legacy programs to new programs, and faster growth lines of business. Both businesses have robust pipelines driven by their respective investments in different technologies. The group's continual focus on margin performance will result in sequential margin expansion throughout the year as they continue to build their backlog and growth. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of year.\nApart from what I have already said about aerospace, I will stick to that custom. We do, however, confirm the guidance we gave you at the end of last quarter, and we'll update it at midpoint of the year as we typically do. This concludes my remarks with respect to what was, in many respects, a rewarding quarter. Let me now turn the call back to Nicole to take your questions.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. Again, we do ask, pardon me, that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Again, press star one to join the queue. Your first question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of A&D Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of A&D Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nKim, can you clarify the G700 delivery expectation for Q2? Is it the 20 that are ready to go plus the seven to eight that will be ready at the end of this month?\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nSo let me kind of tackle that. I alluded to it in my opening statement, but we have 50 to 52 airplanes that are going to deliver in about equal amounts of the 700 in Q2 through Q4. So think about it that way. So I think that'll help you.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of A&D Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then, Phebe, I was hoping you could spend a moment maybe talking about the growth that combat systems are currently seeing in Europe and perhaps how you expect that to trend over the coming quarters. Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo the growth in Europe is clearly driven by the threat environment. We've seen increases in orders for combat wheeled and tracked vehicles and significant bridge orders. We're also seeing increased orders coming out of various countries in Europe for Abrams through the FMS process. So we see that demand signal continuing until the threat environment, frankly, improves.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExcutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. Thanks very much. Looking to Marine, when we think about the expectation for the profit margin for the year and kind of where we started, are there kind of visible milestones that you see through the remainder of the year that bring that number higher, or kind of is it a change in mix, or kind of what drives the underlying margin improvement through the year?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo two things. One is the increase in productivity at each of the shipyards, and we see that, and we've been seeing that for the last few quarters. And it's also fewer disruptions from the supply chain. So those are the two primary factors.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExcutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nRight. Okay. Okay. Great. And then just when we think about, I think you mentioned some of the headwinds to demand at Gulfstream from here in terms of monetary policy, geopolitical issues. Just to kind of affirm the expectation for 160 deliveries this year and the way that the backlog will trend through the year, the expectation is that that's a very sustainable number with potential for that to grow in the years beyond.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo let me clarify a bit. I don't see concerns about inflation or monetary policy impacting demand. It really is just impacting the time from the initiation of a potential interest to the closure of an order, which is also impacted somewhat by large airplane fleet orders from corporate customers. So think about it that way. More of a timing issue with the completion of the deals and not a headwind to overall demand. So I think that's an important nuance. And we're still sticking to our delivery guidance for the year. And I think on a going-forward basis, as we've animated before, we see those deliveries increasing over time.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner of Global Aerospace & Defense, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner of Global Aerospace & Defense, Vertical Research\n\nPhebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the recently passed or soon-to-be-signed supplemental and what implications that could have for the combat business, but also on the submarine side, what sort of additional funding could come from the US Navy. Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo let me take them in the inverse order. On the submarine side, the preponderance of the funding in the supplemental is to help stabilize the industrial base, ensuring that we continue to drive order activity on a consistent and repeatable basis. So that is really on the submarine side. In combat, I think you can see there's a fair amount of ammo funding, and we had fully anticipated that.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner of Global Aerospace & Defense, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. Then just secondly, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the Ajax program in the UK.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nIt is proceeding extremely well through test and continues to work with that customer, but they're very pleased with the performance of the vehicle.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner of Global Aerospace & Defense, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. That's great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace & Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Phebe. Thank you for the time. I wanted to ask one about aerospace, and I'm sorry for putting you on the spot with some mental math, but last year or last quarter, you talked about the G700 profit contribution being around 25%. So when we think about the Q1 performance, it was actually really good relative to our number of 12.1% margin. It would imply you see a deceleration in the underlying business for aerospace just given G700 comes in at 50 units. So I guess, how do we think about the mixed movement throughout the year for aerospace?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, let's talk about the first predicate in that question. I don't believe we've ever disclosed any margin on a particular airplane, and we haven't there. I think you can't take and discern revenue and earnings in any given quarter as attributable to one airplane. So I think you need to think about it holistically. But we don't see any real changes in the mix throughout the year. And we'll do a detailed bottom-up review in Q2, but for right now, we're sticking with both our mix, our earnings, our margin, and revenue expectations. So we're off to a pretty good start, I'd say, and we're very encouraged at how the outlook looks for the rest of the year.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace & Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nCan we assume that G700 is accretive to the 15% full-year guidance?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo think about it this way. This is ultimately going to be a very profitable program, but as I explained in my remarks, the first lot, 20 or so, carries with it additional costs. We'll see those largely in Q2. So think about Q2 as an increase in revenue of about $1 to 1.1 billion, and in earnings of about $100 to 110 million, and then progress nicely thereafter. And again, that's all impacted by the multiplicity of factors in our aerospace business that drive margins.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace & Defense, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace & Defense, Barclays\n\nPhebe, so Rob's question on the supplemental and the submarine industrial base money. So there's money there. There's a lot of money in the base budget of peers. You're spending additional CapEx today that you'll eventually recover through working capital profit. I mean, it's a lot of money. I mean, how does that manifest itself in your numbers as we think about over the next couple of years?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo for the supply chain support, it has minimal impact on us. It's, however, extremely important because the stabilization of the supply chain is critical to the resumption of full cadence on Virginia and the increased cadence on Columbia. So funding is also robust for submarines. We've got one projected in 2025, and then it would be extremely helpful to get a full ship set of Virginia also appropriated because that, again, helps stabilize the industrial base with repeatable revenue that they can plan around.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Aerospace & Defense, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thanks for that. Last quarter, you made some more kind of positive comments regarding the potential for share repurchase to step up. Obviously, you did a little bit this quarter, but not that much. How are you thinking about that now? Did that have to do with the fact that you ended up burning cash in Q1? Just how you're thinking about share repo and the balance sheet from here. Thanks.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo the way we think about share repurchases, and this will be true going forward, is really in the regular order. Recall what we were facing in Q1, and that was we're looking down the throat of a potential, and at some point looked very likely, government shutdown. And so I think that prudence and conservatism in the face of that kind of uncertainty is really key. But the cash performance for the remainder of the year is going to be very strong, and we will act accordingly.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nMorning. Phebe, what's the framework for the pace of G700 deliveries beyond this year compared to this year? Not asking for quarterly numbers or anything like that, but just given this year has some abnormalities compared to a recurring airplane. And then, Kim, just what's the updated view on free cash flow and net income conversion for the year?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, so let me talk about 700. We never, except I think on one or two occasions about five, six years ago, give the future year expectations, but 700 is a very, very successful program, and it will continue to execute well. I'll turn it over to Kim on cash.\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nOn cash. Thank you, Phebe. So with respect to cash and the expectation, we still anticipate achieving about 100% of free cash flow conversion in 2024. We had expected the Q1 to be negative even before considering the fact that we didn't deliver any G700. So we had planned for a negative free cash flow in the Q1, and that was mostly driven by some contract timing in the Combat Systems segment, and some in the Marine Systems segment. But we expect that most of that negative cash will reverse in the Q2 with a stronger Q3 and then a steeper ramp in the Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Phebe, could you comment on or, Kim, could you comment on the margin expansion implied at combat systems as you move through the rest of the year? I think it has to be 80 to 100 basis points on average up year on year for the rest of the year. And maybe the underlying dynamics of, given the volume, why we didn't see more of a drop-through margin in the Q1.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo what drove margin in the Q1 were two things: mix as we came off of older legacy programs, particularly in the vehicle world and in the US, and began ramping up newer vehicle programs in the US. And then a significant amount of the revenue growth came from facilities investment, which by definition carries a lower margin than production. So both of those things will reverse throughout the course of the year, and combat margins will increase. Our expectation is quarter-over-quarter. And remember, this is a high-operating leverage group, so they ought to do quite well here.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. And one clarification on Gulfstream's backlog, if I could. I think that there was some adjustment downward in the backlog. Were those cancellations or Forex, maybe six large jet cancellations or thereabouts?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI don't think that's the way to look at it. But why don't Nicole get back to you on that? But we didn't have any particular notable cancellations, so let us unpack that one with you a little later.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Bank of America\n\nHey, Pheb. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Bank of America\n\nSo Phebe, with the increased demand on munitions and so on and so forth, what are you doing to mitigate any of the issues that could arise from growth in those markets, just like we've seen in the Navy markets, given all the demand and growth? There's been supply chain issues. Are you expecting?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So in the combat world, it's a little bit more of a robust supply chain in general that we typically have not had difficulty with, typically. We know a priori the suppliers who could conceivably cause issues, and we've been working with them to ensure that they can manage this growth. But we're pretty comfortable that we can execute the growth. Our focus is really on operations and execution, and those will be the two key drivers of the profitability in that group.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace & Defense, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Got it. And then maybe back to kind of the naval side of the house and the supply chain. Can you give us any color on where there are actual weaknesses in the supply chain where investment has to be made?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo I'd say in the large in the single-source, sole-source suppliers who are, by definition, critical. And I think the Navy has focused quite intensely on those particular products and supply chain items. And I think they've been pretty explicit about where some of that might be, and I think it's best to think about it that way. But we do believe that working with the Navy customer, the continued infusion into that supply chain will help stabilize. But they are the pacing item now for Electric Boat.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nOn Marine. Good morning. On Marine, the Navy has recently described some shipbuilding delays really across programs. The one that really stood out was Columbia class with delays reported on the turbines and the bow. Can you give us a sense of changes you've seen in schedule that affect you kind of across the program base, and particularly on Columbia?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo I think we've articulated what the Navy has said. I will tell you our throughput and productivity has been strong on Columbia. It enjoys the highest national security priority. So we have done pretty well on Columbia and are increasing our throughput on Columbia. So then it's really those pacing items that are out there. And we're working with our Navy customer to see if there are additional things we can do to recover some schedule and if there are any workarounds, but this is going to be a bit of a slog for the supply chain.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nWell, and then also on shipbuilding, inflation's affected shipbuilding costs a lot over the last few years. We've seen pricing on new awards go up. And when you look forward in the budget, is there a concern that you're basically, if the Navy's budget's really going to be able to afford the kinds of inflation increases that may come along with the continued ramp in shipbuilding?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So I think you've known over the years, I tend not to comment on individual service budgeting, but inflation certainly has been a factor. And to the extent that we can increase throughput to offset some of that, we will. But the Navy is well aware of the inflation impact and I think is working hard with the whole shipbuilding industrial base to address some of that.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nPhebe, following up on the marine question, in addition to the delay in the Columbia class, the DOD did request one less Virginia class for the fiscal year 2025 budget request. So I mean, if we take all this into perspective, can you provide some context on what this means for marine revenue growth over the next few years? And does the margin with a seven handle on it, is that more the new norm for this business?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo let me address that in the inverse order. Margins will be improving at our shipyards. We have every expectation, all of our shipyards: NASSCO, Bath, and Electric Boat. One of the things, as we've talked frequently about, is the margin impact of quality and schedule problems coming out of the supply chain. And as the supply chain stabilizes, that will help as well. And what was your first part of your question?\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThe revenue cadence, including the just one Virginia-class.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So okay. So it has no impact in the short term for Electric Boat because we've got plenty of work in front of us. It could have an impact in the outer years outside of our planning horizon. But critical here is, in fact, the additional ship set of funding. We have long lead material on Virginia that is very important to the supply chain. And to the extent that we can ensure that we get a full second Virginia ship set so that we're buying it to a year, I think is very important for the overall health of the submarine industrial base.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, Phebe.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace & Defense Analyst, RBC\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning, Phebe and Kim.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace & Defense Analyst, RBC\n\nIf we look, Phebe, at your comments around timing in Gulfstream, is it still fair to assume that you should be looking at a book-to-bill at one or greater for Gulfstream in 2024?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo it's a good planning assumption. It is how we are thinking about our internal planning. But let's see how we do as we start to significantly ramp up production and deliveries. But as I said, that's our good planning assumption.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace & Defense Analyst, RBC\n\nOkay. Great. And just a clarification for Kim, the comments sound like the free cash flow ramp really sort of accelerates in the second half of the year. But with all the 700 deliveries expected this quarter, free cash flow should be positive in the Q2, correct?\n\nKim Kuryea\n\nCFO, General Dynamics\n\nYes. That's pretty much what you should assume.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace & Defense Analyst, RBC\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nPhebe, you said recently that even though the aerospace supply chain's improving, your ramp this year could challenge that improvement. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo we still have, look, it's definitely improving. Quality is improving, and schedule reliability is improving. But make no mistake, we still have a lot of out-of-station work. And that impacts the profitability and margin on airplanes that are experiencing that. So we see improvement. We are optimistic that they can keep pace, but it's not without its margin challenges.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Then also, I think you commented you had good bookings in aerospace in the quarter reflecting strong demand. I think you've said the US has been very strong. How is aircraft demand elsewhere in the world?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo there's no real change, I think, from the previous quarters. The US corporations, private and public, high-net-worth individuals, both US and outside the US. So no real changes, no real surprises. Sort of the typical customer base that we see is, I think, the way you should think about it.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks. Good morning, Phebe and Kim.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHey, Phebe. Phebe, the Army wants to reach 100,000 155 shells by, I think, October 2025. Can you update us on how your ramp is going? You've discussed that that supply chain's a little more robust.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So our ramp there is more about increasing the facilities that we have. And as I noted in my remarks, the opening of our Texas facility, which we worked very, very hard to expedite and, frankly, did it in almost record time, was very important because it increased the throughput and the productivity of the number of shells by 83%. So we're on track with the Army to get where we need to be, and our objective is to move even faster than so far we have been. But the Army has been a critical and extremely important partner here in what is really a national security imperative.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYep. Thanks for that. And then, just if you could make any comments on the G280 program, just given the conflict that's going on in the Middle East.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo we had anticipated the impacts on the 280s in our guidance to you, but I will tell you that they are doing quite well and are slightly ahead of our schedule. We're still sticking to our deliveries, but I think it's notable that they're managing pretty well in this tough environment.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nAppreciate the color. Thanks, Phebe.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes. Thank you, Phebe, and good quarter.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Cai.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nCould you update us on the status of the G400? How's it doing? And is it fair to assume that it might have a gap of approximately 12 months between its certification and that of the G800?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI think I said last quarter, I'm done predicting a process over which we have little control. We've tried in the past to give you indicators of our internal or actually, our internal dates. So I'm kind of out of the detailed predicting mode. I will say the program is doing extremely well, and it will fly in the Q3, and I think we'll be flying a pretty mature airplane.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nExcellent. And then your R&D was up a fair amount in the Q1. Could you give us some color of the pattern of the R&D at Gulfstream this year and looking forward? How should we think about that?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, pretty much steady as she goes, particularly this year. We've got a number of, as you know, programs in the certification process. And so I'd see that at least through this year as pretty consistent. No real surprise this year. Steady as she goes.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nU.S. Aerospace & Defense Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey. Good morning, everybody. Phebe, I wanted to just quickly go back to your comments on aerospace and what I guess you'd describe as an elongation of your sales cycle. But if you could just talk a little bit about the overall size of the pipeline and how that is evolving. I understand things are taking longer to close, but I'd also be kind of curious to know whether there are an increasing number of people that are interested.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo the pipeline remains robust, and I look to that as encouraging, a good sign. It's been that way for a while. People want our airplanes, and that's driving demand.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nU.S. Aerospace & Defense Analyst, Citigroup\n\nOkay. Great. So good metrics going on there, it sounds like. Then just really quickly, and maybe this is a question targeted at technologies, but I'd love to get some updated thoughts from you on Artificial intelligence, AI, the adoption that you're seeing with your customers, how you see this kind of playing out and affecting your business. And maybe, as I suggest, focused on technologies.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So we have been investing in AI to support our customers, and particularly at GDIT and somewhat at Mission Systems. And I would say that we're working closely with our customers as they define what the art of the possible is for them in AI. And as you all know, there's some governance challenges around that. But the more sophisticated we get in our ability to tailor AI solutions, I think the more comfortable our customer becomes and will ultimately drive some increased revenue. Haven't seen too much of that yet because I think the government is not unlike other industries where its adoption is, people are careful and they think properly so. And I would argue that would be true across the entirety of our business.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nU.S. Aerospace & Defense Analyst, Citigroup\n\nYeah. I think.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nAbby, I think we have, oh, sorry. I was just going to say I think we have time for just one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nPhebe, you highlighted the stronger second-half aerospace margins. That's a more normal volume and G700 production. Is that more of an appropriate starting point for 2025 than the full year 15%?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nNice try. So look, yeah. I think once you get through the first lot, then our performance from a margin standpoint will continue to improve. And you'll see that Q3 will be significantly better than Q2. And Q4 will be even better still. But we will update you in our regular order. We kind of keep our discipline, as you well know, around updating guidance. And I think that that's appropriate.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nYep. Appreciate that detail. And then just in terms of the 100% cash conversion for the year, what's the opportunity to exceed that given last year you were well above, and you built a lot of G700 inventory?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI think right now we're just focused, given the steep ramp in the second half of the year. We're really focusing on trying to hit that mark at this point in time.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace & Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWe should get there.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nGreat. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the Q1 Earnings Release and Highlights Presentation.

These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I will turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.64 per diluted share on revenue of $11,668 million, operating earnings of $1,288 million, and net earnings of $1 billion. Revenue is up $817 million, a strong 7.5% against Q4 last year. Operating earnings are up $61 million, and earnings per share are up $0.06, or 1.7%. The year-ago quarter had $52 million more of other net income, which helps explain the more modest earnings per share growth. In short, the quarter-over-quarter results compare quite favorably, particularly revenue and operating earnings.\nThe sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $1,097 million, a very strong 10.4%, operating earnings by $231 million, or 21.9%, net earnings by $169 million, or 20.2%, and EPS by $0.60, a 19.7% improvement. As we promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, revenue, earnings per share, operating earnings, and net earnings improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year.\nIt was a nice, steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $42.3 billion, up 7.3%, and operating earnings of $4.25 billion, up 0.8%, and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.02, down $0.17, a 1.4% decrease mostly as a result of below-the-line items like other income, which was higher, and the tax provision, which was lower in 2022. Q4 and the year are $0.04 and $0.09, respectively, below consensus. It is important to note the consensus lowered during the two weeks before this earnings release as the sell side became aware of Gulfstream's deliveries from public sources.\nThis miss was exclusively because the G700 did not certify before year-end. As a result, Gulfstream was unable to deliver 15 G700s as we and the sell side had anticipated. I will have more to say about this in my segment remarks. While we miss consensus and our own expectations for reasons beyond our control, it should not distract from an otherwise good quarter and year. Let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong cash performance for the quarter and the year, overall order activity and backlog, and any other items you might like to address.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were a strong story for us in 2023. We finished the year with total backlog of $93.6 billion, up 2.5 billion over last year. Total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, was nearly $132 billion. In terms of orders, the Aerospace segment led the way with a 1.2 to 1 book-to-bill ratio in both Q4 and full year, and they ended the year with total backlog of $20.5 billion. The defense segments had a book-to-bill of 0.7x in Q4 and one-to-one for the full year. Overall, the company had a book-to-bill of 1.1x for the year, and all four segments were one-to-one or better.\nTurning to our cash performance, it was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, which brings us to $4.7 billion of operating cash flow for the year. As discussed on previous calls, this level of cash flow was achieved on the strength of Gulfstream orders, additional payments on Combat Systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in Technologies. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was $3.8 billion, a cash conversion rate of 115%. This was nicely ahead of our anticipated cash flow for the year, notwithstanding the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700.\nLooking at capital deployment, capital expenditures, as I noted on the last call, were higher in Q4 at $304 million, which brings us to $904 million for the full year. The lion's share of these investments are, of course, in our shipyards to support the Navy's submarine and shipbuilding plan. At 2.1% of sales, full-year capital expenditures were a little lower than our original expectation due to timing, so some of that naturally pushes into next year. As a result, we expect CapEx to be between 2% and 2.5% of sales next year and closer to 2% thereafter. We also paid $360 million in dividends in Q4, bringing the full year to $1.4 billion. There were no shares repurchased in the quarter, so we finished the year with two million shares repurchased for $434 million at $215 per share.\nWith respect to our pension plans, we contributed $106 million in 2023, which included a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, and we expect to contribute approximately $75 million in 2024. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $7.3 billion, down approximately $1.9 billion, more than 20% from last year. We have $500 million of debt maturing in 2024. Our net interest expense in Q4 was $78 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $343 million. That compares to $85 million, and $364 million in the respective 2022 periods. We expect interest expense in 2024 to continue to decrease to around $320 million.\nTurning to income taxes, we had an 18.1% effective tax rate in Q4, which brings our full-year rate to 16.8%, slightly below, but generally in line with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect the full-year effective tax rate to increase to around 17.5%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. That concludes this portion of my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe for segment comments.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Jason. First, Aerospace. The story in Aerospace is found in sequential and year-over-year improvement, continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, the overall strength of Gulfstream's service business, and the continuing growth of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.74 billion and earnings of $449 million. This represents a 12% increase in revenue and a 33% increase in earnings on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The sequential numbers are even stronger, with a 35% increase in revenue coupled with a staggering 68% increase in operating earnings. The important point here is the dramatic increase in the delivery of in-service airplanes in the quarter, 39 versus 27 in Q3 of 2023.\nA strong mix favoring large aircraft, strong pricing in the backlog, better overhead absorption, and improved supply chain response, leading to less out-of-station work, all contributed to a 16.4% margin in the quarter. For the full year, revenue of $8.62 billion is up only $54 million from the prior year, and operating earnings of $1.18 billion improved by $52 million on a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin. Nevertheless, Aerospace revenue and earnings are less than we anticipated for the quarter and the year because, as I mentioned earlier, we did not receive the certification of the G700 in Q4 and did not deliver 15 aircraft we had ready to go.\nThat deprived us of slightly over $1 billion of revenue and close to $250 million in earnings. These, of course, are orders of magnitude figures. We were also unable during the course of the year to increase production of in-service aircraft as planned because of well-known supply chain issues that began to resolve in Q4. So, where are we in our journey toward G700 certification? We are almost complete with the final Technical Inspection Authorization. FAA Function and Reliability Flight Testing is almost done, and almost all of the paperwork associated with the process has been submitted.\nIn the meantime, we are asking customers to schedule their pre-delivery inspections contemplating delivery this quarter. All that having been said, let me turn to the demand environment. The book-to-bill was 1.2x in the quarter and 1.2x for the year. Backlog increased $395 million sequentially, and $938 million for the year. So, Aerospace demand remains strong for both aircraft and services at Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. I should add that strong order intake was interrupted for a two- to three-week period twice during the year, once for a macroeconomic event, and the second for a geopolitical event.\nI refer to the regional bank failures earlier in the year and the conflict initiated by the Hamas attack on Israel and the resultant conflict in Gaza. In each case, order intake resumed after a brief pause. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong, and sales activity is at a solid pace. Aerospace backlog is up 72% since Q1 of 2021 when we first detected a measurable uptake in order activity. In summary, Aerospace results are in line with our original forecast, excluding the G700 certifications delay. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2024 and improved operating margin, but I'll say more about this as we get the guidance.\nWe also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet Aviation to perform well in the year. Next, Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $2.36 billion is up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $351 million are up 5.7% on a 40-basis-point decrease in operating margin, but still a very good 14.8%. The majority of the growth in the quarter was at Ordnance and Tactical Systems and European Land Systems. It was largely driven by higher artillery and propellant volume, including programs to expand production volume, higher volume of PIRANHAs, Bridges, and EAGLEs in Europe, and new international tank programs.\nNot surprisingly, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $140 million, or 6.3%, and earnings are up $51 million, or 17% on the strength of a 130-basis-point improvement in margins. From an order perspective, Combat had a very good year with a 1.1x book-to-bill driven by very strong international demand for the Abrams Main Battle Tank, growing demand on the munitions side of the business, and particular strength in Europe. By the way, Combat's performance for the year significantly outperformed our expectations. 2023 revenue was up 13% against a flat forecast provided earlier in the year.\nOperating earnings are up 72 million, or 6.7%, with operating margin at 13.9% for the year. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter and a year with strong revenue growth, strong margin performance, good order activity, and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Turning to Marine, the powerful Marine Systems growth story continues. Q4 revenue of $3,408 million is up 14.8% over the year-ago quarter. Revenue is also up 13.5% sequentially and 12.9% for the year. This was driven by Columbia-class construction and engineering volume, T-AO volume, and service contracts at Bath.\nOperating earnings are down 8.4% over the year-ago quarter on a 160-basis-point reduction in operating margin attributable to EAC rate decreases at Electric Boat. These rate decreases similarly impact the sequential and annual comparison with respect to operating earnings. The EAC decreases were primarily driven by two factors: later-than-promised material to EB, which drove additional out-of-station work at EB, and quality problems from several vendors. On the positive side, we are continuing to work with the Navy and the Congress to help further stabilize the supply chain with additional funding for work.\nWe are also working with certain suppliers to set up process improvements where we can. EB also needs to continue to improve its productivity to help offset some of the financial impacts from the supply chain. Marine Systems had a 1x book-to-bill for the year, a good result for a group of shipyards that began the year with a total backlog of nearly $46 billion. Jason will now give you some color on the Technologies group for which he has responsibility, and then I'll return for our outlook for 2024.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThe Technologies group had a solid quarter and a very strong year. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was down 3.1% compared with the prior year, while operating earnings of $305 million were down 10.3% versus Q4 of 2022. For the year, however, the group's revenue of $12.9 billion was up 3.4%, with both businesses experiencing nice growth. The results exceeded our expectations on strong demand for the group's products and services. GDIT fared particularly well with increased volume across each of its customer-facing segments: Defense, Intel, and Federal Civilian.\nOperating earnings of $1.2 billion were down by 2% versus the prior year on a 50-basis-point contraction in operating margin to 9.3%, and that's solely a function of the revenue mix as IT services grew faster than the defense electronics portfolio. Turning back to the quarterly performance to break it down between the two businesses, GDIT's revenue was up in all four quarters compared with 2022, and they've now grown their top line in each of the past three years. The same is true for Mission Systems' quarterly revenue performance, with the exception of Q4.\nIf you recall, last year's Q4 saw us break through a log jam in the supply chain and deliver an unusually high number of products lifting both revenue and margins. Barring that anomaly in 2022, the group's comparisons on a quarterly and full-year basis are quite favorable. With respect to order activity and backlog, the Technologies group had a very good year, notwithstanding the continuing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. The individual businesses and the group as a whole achieved a one-to-one book-to-bill on solid revenue growth. GDIT received awards totaling $13.5 billion, far exceeding their previous annual record set the year before.\nThey've got another $15 billion in awards pending adjudication and just shy of $2 billion in awards under protest. Mission Systems had a great year as well, with a total value of submitted bids almost triple the level they saw in 2022. Of course, many of the group's awards come in the form of IDIQ contracts with potential value that doesn't initially hit the backlog, so much of these positive results will continue to manifest in the reported numbers over time. To that point, we ended the quarter with a total estimated contract value for the group of nearly $41 billion, and the group's combined qualified pipeline exceeds $130 billion. So, all in all, a great year for the Technologies group.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, let me provide our operating forecast for 2024 with some color around our outlook for each business group and then the company-wide roll-up. In 2024, we expect Aerospace revenue of about $12 billion, up around 40% over 2023. Operating margin is expected to be up 130 basis points to 15%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 160 basis points, materially over the 111 delivered in 2023. This is about 10 fewer deliveries than we anticipated in the multi-year forecast we gave you in January of 2022. The mix will include about 50 G700 deliveries and fewer G280s as a result of the Gaza conflict's impact on our Israel-based supplier.\nAs I just noted, we anticipate a 15% operating margin for the year, weaker in the first half, particularly in Q2, and then well over 15% in Q3 and Q4. While the ramp-up is slightly less than previously anticipated, it is not without supply chain challenges. In Combat Systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be flat in 2023. With a changed threat environment, we had a 13% increase in revenue. For 2024, we expect revenue to be up about 3% to $8.5 billion, coupled with a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin to 14.4%. The outlook is a result of the strong order activity we saw in 2023 and the demand signals we see in Europe.\nTo the extent that these demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue later in the year, particularly in our armaments and munitions business. As I noted earlier, the Marine group has been on a remarkable growth journey. In 2023, revenue came in much stronger than expected, almost $1.6 billion, against a flattish forecast. Our outlook for this year anticipates revenue of about $12.8 billion, with operating margin improvement to 7.6%, which should result in a meaningful improvement in earnings in 2024. In Technologies, 2023 revenue was stronger than anticipated in both businesses.\n2024 revenue is expected to be up about 1% to $13 billion. Within the group, GDIT will be up low single digits, and Mission Systems will be down slightly due to a transition from legacy systems and a slow ramp-up on new programs. Operating margins are expected to improve 20 basis points to about 9.5%. We see long-term low single-digit growth for the group and continued industry-leading margins. So, for 2024 company-wide, we expect to see revenue of approximately $46.3 to 46.4 billion, an increase of around 9.5%.\nWe anticipate operating margin of 11%, up 100 basis points from 2023. All this rolls up to an EPS forecast of around $14.40. A reasonable range would be $14.35 to 14.45. On a quarterly basis, the first two quarters look a lot alike with very strong Q3 and Q4. In summary, as we go into this year, we feel very good about the demand environment across all of our businesses. It has been some time since I have seen stronger demand signals and better promise of organic growth. We also have some very good opportunities across the business to improve operating margins. All we must do is execute. It almost goes without saying that we'll be laser-focused on operations. Nicole, back to you.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. Again, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question. We'll take our first question from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning, Myles.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Wolfe Research\n\nPhebe, I was hoping you could touch on the G700's price. How many do you have ready for pre-delivery inspection from your customers? And also, relative to confidence of when the deliveries could take place, I mean, this is pretty much out of your control. The FAA has published a few rules last week that are pending and have to go through their process. I'm just curious your confidence level for Q1 delivery versus, say, where you were in Q4 expecting deliveries by year-end. Thanks.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, we have 15 airplanes ready to go, and the hope is that we deliver them this quarter. The notifications that Gulfstream made earlier, I guess, this week are in the regular order and really have no material impact on the certification process. I tried to give you as much clarity as I could around the certification and where we are.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Wolfe Research\n\nIs there an 800 delivery assumed in the guidance for 2024?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, we're not going to go into what we've assumed for any given airplane in our guidance. So, let me give you guys some perspective about this. For the last eight years, we've tried to give you some clarity about a process over which we have no control. And it's kind of like sticking your fingers in a light socket to predict a process that we just don't control. So, I think we're going to be silent as we go forward about any specificity around certification timing because then we hear words like slip and miss, and these planes are going to get certified, but get certified on the FAA schedule.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Wolfe Research\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Aerospace and Defense Electronics, Bank of America\n\nHey, yeah. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Maybe just circling back on your remarks, Phebe, around EB, but maybe more broadly, just kind of the ship industrial base. The DOD has been making some big investments. Where do you see Virginia-class build rates ultimately getting Columbia too? Because it just seems like the supply chain and maybe just also from just a capacity perspective, we're just under-capacitized. So, I mean, if any thoughts on that?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, let's step back a minute and talk a little bit about the shipbuilding industrial base in general and the submarine industrial base in particular. These are very heavily manpower-driven businesses, industry, and an entire supply chain. Our manpower availability was impacted significantly as a result of COVID in two respects. First, we had a really stunning increase in the timing and the number of retirements of seasoned workers throughout the industrial base. That, coupled with the post-COVID labor shortages, caused considerable perturbation in the supply chain. Those will begin to remedy. We've already seen some stabilization in the labor market. Those will remedy.\nBut there's clearly learning that has to happen throughout the supply chain. I'd say with respect to capacity, at Electric Boat, we are nicely sufficient capacity in the moment to deal with the demand that we see at the moment. Should that demand signal increase in the near term, we'll work closely with our Navy customer. I think key to this stabilization of the supply chain is improved delivery and improved quality. That happens as new workers come down their learning curves. We've benefited Electric Boat because they have a very robust training system in which our new workers come out at a higher level of proficiency, but still, they need to come down their learning curves.\nThey're doing so nicely. I think to add a little bit of perspective to that, at Electric Boat, we increased our velocity and throughput on Virginia by about 10% this year in 2024 and about 30% on Columbia. Electric Boat is continuing to do well. They just need to continue to improve their productivity so we can continue to offset some of these financial impacts that we're seeing from the supply chain. But I would finally mention the Navy has been a very good partner in recognizing these challenges and working hard to get orders and certainty of demand into the supply chain. And that helps the entire supply chain plan.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Aerospace and Defense Electronics, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Maybe just one quick follow-on. Are we capacitized enough to meet the demand that AUKUS would require, having an extra Virginia-class every three years?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, I think we're going to look at all of that with the Navy. But let me tell you, the best thing we can do for AUKUS in the moment is get back to two-a-year production. That's one step at a time.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Jason Gursky at Citigroup.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nUS Aerospace and Defense Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everybody.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nUS Aerospace and Defense Analyst, Citigroup\n\nPhebe, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the G400 and how that plane seems to be performing from a market-acceptance perspective and kind of the pipeline that you're seeing for that aircraft. I'm just kind of curious how that segment of your market is shaping up there as we come into the new year.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, the plane is performing very nicely in excess of the design parameters. We see considerable interest in that end of the market. And so, we are quite positive about that airplane when it enters into service.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nUS Aerospace and Defense Analyst, Citigroup\n\nOkay. Great. And then your comments on Combat and the potential for some orders converting into revenue coming out of Europe in the second half of the year, that doesn't sound like it's implied in your guidance. But I'm just kind of curious how far into the year can we go, get those orders, and actually convert them into revenue?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, it depends on what the orders are for. On faster transaction material, like service and munitions, they can move a little more quickly. Longer lead orders on combat vehicles take a little bit longer. So, we factored, to the best of our ability, the known demand signals and the velocity of contracting into our plan. So, to the extent that there is upside, it'll be, I think, largely on the armament munition programs that execute at a faster rate.\nAnd to the extent that we can speed up even further the installation of additional jigs and fixtures for productivity, as well as our increased scope on delivery of munitions, that should help as well. But we think we have a look, in all cases, we give you a very balanced, I'd say, 50/50 plan with opportunities and risks. We're quite comfortable with the estimates that we've given you at the time.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to David Strauss at Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAerospace and Defence Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHi, David. [crosstalk]\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAerospace and Defence Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nPhebe, any thoughts on how the budget process for 2024 might actually play out here, given that we're quickly approaching the potential for a sequester?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, we have factored in all known funding into our plan. Should we see an extensive continuing resolution, we'll have to see what impact that has on our faster transaction businesses because every CR plays out a bit differently. To the extent that we have a sequester, then we have factored some of that. But clearly, you can't do all of it into your plan. So, we'll adjust accordingly. But we are hopeful that the US Congress is able to pass a critical defense bill, particularly in these times, given the threat environment.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAerospace and Defence Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Jason, I wanted to ask about free cash flow and capital deployment, maybe help with some of the big moving pieces. I mean, obviously, inventory was a big drag, but advances helped a lot. Your cash taxes have been really high. How do those all factor in in 2024? And I assume your guidance includes nothing as usual for capital deployment. How should we think about that, given you have very little in maturities this year? Thanks.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So, when you think about free cash flow, we are anticipating to continue in the 100% conversion range in 2024 and beyond. Obviously, we outperformed that a bit in 2023, but that doesn't affect what we expect in 2024. So, the good news is a lot of the larger scale moving parts around cash flow are starting to settle down a little bit. We've experienced some big headwinds and then some corresponding tailwinds over the past several years. But right now, if you look ahead, I think you can expect for the Aerospace group fairly steady conversion at or slightly above 100% conversion.\nWhen you think about it, we had a pretty big tailwind when they were building the significant backlog over the past few years, and all the deposits were coming in. So, that more than offset any effective inventory build. So, as you transition into a period where you're starting to deliver off that inventory, but then you assume a steady one-to-one book-to-bill, you should be in a pretty regular burn rate at ±100% conversion, for that business. Combat Systems, on the other hand, should continue to see tailwinds as they work through some of the receivables and work-in-process on the international programs that we've made some great progress on in recent years. So, that'll continue for a couple of years.\nThe Technologies group is a steady provider, well above 100% conversion. And the Marine Systems group, as we noted, is still finishing up some of the large capital projects. We're coming through that now, and we'll see what the future holds, as Phebe alluded to, in terms of Navy investment. But when you kind of net all those together, we're right about 100% for the coming year. If you look at capital deployment, as you noted, there's not a lot in terms of commitment. We've got $500 million in notes that mature out in November of this year. So, we've got plenty of time to kind of see how things play out and decide what we want to do with that maturity. No rush on that decision.\nWe'll look at all options, as we always have. I think we've got great opportunity for stepped-up share repurchases as more, I should say, as uncertainty sort of moves out of the environment. We looked at the last half of last year, the last quarter of last year, and the significant threat of a government shutdown sort of hung over the environment. That factors into our thinking as we think about how we preserve cash and deploy capital. If we can get past that in March 2024, then I think it provides a lot of optionality for us as we look ahead on the capital deployment front.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYou know, if you think about it, the demand signals we see and our expected growth make share repurchases increasingly compelling.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAerospace and Defence Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHey, one thing that Jason talked about, just mentioned tangentially, and I want to focus a little bit on, and just give you guys some perspective. When we talk about a one-to-one book-to-bill in our businesses, that's really for planning purposes. It's not a forecast. So, just keep that in mind.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Phebe, Jason. Thank you for the time.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nPhebe, great color on Gulfstream. You gave some numbers around the lost revenues and profit that slipped into 2024 from the G700, which would imply north of 20% margins for the G700. Given you have quite a few built up already, any color you could give on the profit profile of the G700 relative to maybe the G650, the G500, and the G600?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHey, can you repeat the last part of your question? It was kind of coming in.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nSure. Sorry. It was more just the profit profile of the G700 relative to the G650 and the G500 and G600 as it entered service, [crosstalk] just because you gave the revenue.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So, they come in, yeah, the G700 comes in at accretive margins. But as you all know, and many of you are quite expert in this, we've talked about over the years, including on this call, the margin performance at Gulfstream is driven by a host of issues. And as I noted in my remarks, mix, pricing, out-of-station work, all impacted. So, I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the way to think about our plan is a really balanced plan. Not quite the question you asked, but I'd stick with that, and I'd think about it that way. But these new airplanes are coming in at very nice margins.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Then if I could ask one more on the defense side of the business, just given a lot of what your peers are talking about as well. You have pretty robust demand in Marine and Combat, but earnings growth tends to be below revenue growth. Just given inflation and mix, how do you think about GD's ability to continue to grow defense profits? It seems like Combat is seeing some of that.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nCombat is seeing some of it, but I tried to give you some perspective earlier on the impacts of what happened to the industrial base in the Marine group. It also impacted Gulfstream as a result of COVID. So, for us, it's really a question of operating excellence, operating excellence, operating excellence. We're going to focus on that very heavily. So, we drive increased profitable growth. That's the value proposition that we're looking at right now.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Seth Seifman at JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, [crosstalk] Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nMorning. I wanted to start off asking about Combat and just the 3% growth guide. I guess even if we adjust for some seasonality, I might have thought that the activity levels that we're seeing here in the, or that we saw in the second half of 2023 would lead to some really quite robust growth in the first half, perhaps even double-digit. And then being at 3% would imply something like flat or down in the second half. Am I not thinking about that cadence properly, or is there some reason for the growth to really step off or come down in the second half?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nNo. I wouldn't look at anything macro with respect to that. In a quickly growing environment, contracts tend to come in a little bit more lumpier. And so, this is simply a question of timing. I think we see mid-to-upper single digits over and toward the higher-upper single digits over our planned period. But we've given you the plan that, given the faster execution of contracting that we saw last year, we may have a bit of a slowdown in the first couple of quarters and then acceleration as the year goes on. But the demand is there.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nSure. Sure. Okay. Excellent. And then on Aerospace, I guess it's probably about two years ago that you gave us kind of a multi-year look at the Aerospace business and the expectations there as the demand started to gather. Since that bunch of stuff has happened, I think demand has probably been a little stronger than expected. We've also seen some supply chain issues, some certification push-outs. As we think about sort of a multi-year outlook for Aerospace in terms of deliveries and profitability, is that something you can update at this time?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So, we're going to deliver 160 airplanes. That's in our plan this year. I will say that 2025 will be more deliveries and 2026 even more deliveries. But at this point, given the issues that you mentioned, we're not going to be any more granular than that. We owe you additional fidelity as time goes on.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nPhebe, maybe just following on that, but a little bit bigger picture, I was curious to hear you talk about how you're managing supply versus demand in this pretty unique business jet market. Because if you go to $12 billion in revenue, that's run-rating $3 billion a quarter. Based on the change in backlog, I know that's imperfect, but directionally, the order rate had made it to $3 billion a quarter, but it's now slowed a little bit, and we're trying to figure out where this market settles out. You want to get customers' airplanes, and you want to grow.\nBut I know you also want to maintain backlog and that you're more focused on pricing and margins than units. If you're going to $12, and then, as you just said to Seth, you're going to go higher, I guess you'd be burning backlog. So, how do you think about managing that multi-year supply versus demand in that market?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, I don't see us particularly burning through backlog, given the robust backlog we have and given the robust pipeline that we have. We're off to a good start this year. So, I don't see anything that particularly drives an unhealthy burn through the backlog. We have believed for some time, and it is turning out to be the case that new clean-sheet airplanes drive incremental demand. And we're certainly seeing that, and we don't see much of an abatement in that.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. It sounds like you potentially expect that quarterly order rate to pick back up moving forward as your new airplanes are more entrenched in the market.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, look, our order rate has been quite healthy and quite wholesome, and we would expect additional orders supported by the pipeline to come in this year. So, we're not going to give you any real granularity around orders-per-quarter, but we see nice demand, continuing interest, and a very solid pipeline. To me, those are the sort of foundational elements that we rely on for looking on a going-forward basis, looking at what production can ultimately be.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Cai von Rumohr at TD Cowen.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes. Thank you very much, Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHi, Cai.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nGood numbers. So, Gulfstream, two issues. First, you mentioned the Hamas attack and the impact on the G280. Maybe tell me the status of that and what that means in terms of your ability to get deliveries. And secondly, I think the bigger question is, by my quick math, it looks like your guidance for 2024 implies an 18% incremental margin at Gulfstream, which seems low given the good margins you should be getting on the G700.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSee, so.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n[crosstalk] Don't have a plan.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYou're right. So, look, let's agree that we shouldn't, in any given moment, infer something from an implied margin. I think, as you know probably better than most, that the margin performance in any given quarter is driven by a myriad of factors that we have gone over multiple times. I think in this environment where we are encouraged by the supply chain, but we've got more ways to go, we think that we have given you a very, very balanced plan. I really stick to that plan. That's how I think about it.\nWith respect to the G280, we have properly adjusted our plan to deal with the realities of what they are facing there. They are continuing to perform with retirees and management. As I say, we factored all of that into our expectations for the year.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nSo, I mean, I still don't quite understand the 18% margin. Is that sort of a P&L drag, the fact that they can't get enough, or the timing?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nI wouldn't say it's a P&L drag. It's just a reality of the multiplicity of factors that are impacting us. 2024 is a pivotal year. We saw significant improvement in the supply chain during the course of the year that, frankly, allowed us to increase production in the latter half of the year. If you recall, we were delivering between 24 and 25 aircraft, and we delivered 39 in Q4. That makes us pretty optimistic that we can continue to increase production. But we are cautious about the ability of the supply chain to keep up. All indicators are that they're doing quite well. But this is one step at a time, and there's more risk. As I say, we're optimistic, but we've got a ways to go.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to George Shapiro at Shapiro Research.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Partner, Shapiro Research\n\nYes. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHi, George.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Partner, Shapiro Research\n\nHi, Phebe. Just following up a bit on Cai's question, I mean, the incremental margin was like 38% here in this Q4, which is pretty extraordinary. So, I mean, what changes to really knock that down to the point that Cai's comment?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHey, you guys are reverse-engineering incremental margin, and it's almost impossible to deal with in the complexity of this business. I would infer nothing from it. Look, let's talk about the underlying capabilities. Gulfstream has a lot of operating leverage. They've always been good since we acquired them at GD years ago; they have been strong operating performers with very good margin performance and gross margins coming out of their operations. That won't change. But the mix of business, the level of any given quarters, timing around supply chain and its impact on out-of-station work, and mix of service, Jet Aviation, all of those things are contributing.\nSo, there is nothing systemic other than those issues that you know, and they are temporary, and we will work through the supply chain issues. But there's nothing systemic that should concern you about where we stand on Gulfstream and its ability to increase margins, earnings, and revenue over time here.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Partner, Shapiro Research\n\nOne for you, Jason. The unbilled receivables were down like $450 million in the quarter. Is that just Ajax catching up?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nIt's a little bit Ajax, and it's a little bit of the ongoing payments on our other large international program at Combat Systems. Those are the two big pieces. Yes, George.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Robert Spingarn at Melius Research.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nPhebe, the Marine group implies about $340 million in sales growth. And in the past, you've talked about Columbia driving $400 to 500 million of growth per year. So, could an economic price adjustment for Virginia-class be a meaningful source of sales and operating income for Marine in 2024?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, EPA adjustments can always be a good source of income. Look, I think the way that we've always talked about Marine growth being somewhat lumpy, $3 to 500 million in any given year. But in the next two years, we expect between $600 million and $1 billion in per annum growth. So, the growth is there. It just comes in on a lumpier basis than one might want, but it is there.\nAnd so, with respect to Virginia and any EPA adjustments, we're continuing to work with the Navy. We had contemplated the impact of Columbia prioritization as had the Navy on Virginia, and that's just a work in progress as we work through all the particulars with the Navy. But we think we've given you a pretty good indicator of this year's revenue, and we'll adjust it accordingly if anything changes on the upside.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nSo, just to be clear, there's nothing in there for an adjustment yet?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nNo. I think it's premature to put numbers in before you've got an agreement with your customers.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nFair enough. Fair enough. Thank you.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nAudra, I think we have time for just one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take that question from Peter Arment at Baird.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Aerospace and Defense, Baird\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Hey, Phebe, maybe just to end on and just speak on Marine. You've given us a lot of details on what some of the pressures were. But we've seen throughout the industry, the Defense Production Act has been used to kind of improve some capacity at rocket motors and munitions. Is there an opportunity? I mean, I know the Navy's a really good partner and customer. Is there an opportunity to get some relief and free up some additional resources for you at the yards?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo, we have been pretty well resourced by the Navy for many, many years in anticipation of particularly the Columbia and Block V. So, I think from our perspective, where we really need some assistance and continued assistance from the Navy is stabilization of on-time delivery and quality coming out of the supply chain. So, I think that as we go through this year, I'm sure there'll be additional opportunities for us to work with the Navy and find some ability to relieve those pain points that remain in the supply chain.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Aerospace and Defense, Baird\n\nAppreciate the color. Thanks, Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHey, and listen, before we leave, I just wanted—this is, for many of you may know, this is Jason's last earnings call. And I wanted to thank him for his excellent years of service as a CFO. He will be missed, but his work will continue at Technologies. So, I'm sure all of you will join me in congratulating Jason on a superb CFO job well done over the years.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nOkay. Well, thank you all for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for Q4 Earnings Release and Highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

On the call today are Jayson Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer, and Bill Moss, Vice President and Controller. With the introductions complete, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. The first thing I'll note is that our Chairman and CEO, Phebe Novakovic, is under the weather today, so I'll be conducting today's call along with Bill. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.04 per diluted share on revenue of $10.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.06 billion, and net income of $836 million. Revenue was up $596 million, or 6%, against third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $41 million, or 3.7%. Net earnings were down $66 million, and earnings per share were down 6.7%. So the quarter-over-quarter results show significant growth in revenue, but a 100-basis-point contraction in operating margin. On the other hand, sequential results are quite good across the board. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by 4.1%, operating earnings by 9.9%, net earnings by 12.4%, and EPS by 12.6%.\nFrom a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.13 per share on higher revenue and better operating earnings than anticipated. Operating margin is about the same as expected. The beat came almost entirely from operations. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up 7.2%, operating earnings were down less than 1%, and diluted earnings per share were down 2.6%. We had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.32 billion, and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, which is 131% of net earnings. This follows very good cash performance in the first half. Quarter performance was good in the quarter in all segments, and particularly strong at Gulfstream and the marine segment. You'll hear more detail on cash and backlog, as well as some of the other financial particulars from Bill in just a minute.\nIn short, we enjoyed a strong quarter, particularly so in light of the supply chain and program mix headwinds that time will cure. So let me move right ahead with some color around the performance of the business segments. First, aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2.03 billion and operating earnings of $268 million, with a 13.2% operating margin. Revenue was down $315 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by fewer deliveries at Gulfstream due to supply chain constraints. Operating earnings were down $44 million on lower revenue and a 10 basis points contraction in margin. The sequential comparison is much better. Revenue was up $79 million, or 4%, and operating earnings were up $32 million, or 13.6%, on a 110 basis points improvement in margin. There were 27 deliveries in the quarter, three more than in the second quarter.\nTo provide some additional color here, Gulfstream has made 72 aircraft deliveries through the end of the quarter. We're on track to deliver between 40 and 45 currently in-service aircraft in the fourth quarter. All in, including G700s, we anticipate in excess of 60 deliveries in the quarter, assuming we're granted FAA certification before the end of the year. That said, as you can tell, there's a considerable amount of uncertainty as we get closer to certification. Moving to the demand environment, this was yet another positive quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.4 to 1, and Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.5 to 1. We continue to have vibrant sales activity going into the fourth quarter and expect strong orders. It would, however, be a stretch to get to 1 to 1 in the fourth quarter given our expectation of over 60 deliveries.\nA wildcard in the quarter will be the conflict in Israel and its impact on demand, if any. The period of significant increased aircraft demand began in mid-February of 2021, over two and a half years ago. In 2021, Gulfstream's book-to-bill was 1.7 to 1. In 2022, it was 1.5 to 1. Year-to-date 2023, it's 1.3 to 1. This includes first quarter 2023 when there was a three-week hiatus in orders as a result of the failure of several regional banks. In that quarter, we still managed a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill. All of this leads quite naturally to an astonishing build of the aerospace backlog. It grew from $11.6 billion at the end of 2020 to $20.1 billion at the end of third quarter 2023, an increase of over 70% in two and three-quarter years.\nThis all speaks to me of the underlying strength of the market for our products. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to move closer to its ultimate conclusion. We continue to plan for certification in fourth quarter of this year, largely dependent upon the availability of FAA resources and the credit the FAA may allow for company flying. We currently are spending most of our engineering time on final reports and data submission. Operationally, Gulfstream continues to make good progress under difficult circumstances. But as a result of the supply chain issues that we've previously discussed, we plan to deliver 10 to 12 fewer aircraft this year than the 145 we had originally forecast in the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we continue to expect more service revenue than initially predicted. Next, combat systems.\nCombat Systems had revenue of $2.22 billion, up a stunning 24.4% over the year-ago quarter, with growth at each of the business units, but particularly at OTS and European Land Systems. Earnings were $300 million, which is up 10.7%. Margins at 13.5% represent a 170 basis point reduction versus the year-ago quarter. So once again, we saw powerful revenue performance coupled with more modest operating margins, in large part attributable to mix and new program starts. Some of our revenue increase is a result of facilities contracts to increase our artillery production capacity taken at lower margins. As you'd expect, these contracts will result in additional production at accretive margins over time. On the subject of munitions, we're working very closely with our government customer and have accelerated production faster than planned. The large capacity expansion that we're putting in place today will further increase production.\nWe have a ways to go, but we're making progress. The increase in combat revenue also came from new international vehicle programs, the ramp-up of the M10 Booker, higher artillery program volume, and higher volume on Piranha and Eagle vehicles in Europe. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $300 million, or 15.6%, and earnings were up $49 million, or 19.5%, on a 50 basis points improvement in margin. Year-to-date, revenue was up $775 million, or 15.1%, and operating earnings were up $53 million, or 7.1%, over last year. So the numbers are quite impressive quarter over quarter, sequentially, and year-to-date. Combat systems experienced very good order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a 1 to 1 book-to-bill, a very strong performance given the increased revenue and evidencing strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. Year-to-date, the book-to-bill is 1.3 to 1, which fully supports the growth outlook.\nTurning to marine systems, once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine systems revenue of $3 billion was up $233 million, or 8.4%, against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering drove the growth. Operating earnings were $211 million, down $27 million versus the year-ago quarter, with a 160 basis point decrement in operating margin. The year-ago quarter had a number of favorable EAC adjustments, which did not repeat this quarter. Sequentially, both revenue and operating earnings were down somewhat. Importantly, year-to-date revenue was up $982 million, 12.2%. However, earnings were essentially flat on a 90 basis point contraction in operating margin. The real driver of the margin difficulty has been the late deliveries at Electric Boat from the supply chain, which causes out-of-station work and internal scheduling disruptions. Electric Boat has continued to improve its throughput, but not fast enough to offset the costs of late material.\nWe continue with the help of the Navy to work this issue. At Bath, while we're seeing signs of improved productivity, it has yet to manifest in the business's financial performance. All that said, we're looking for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time. Importantly, marine systems enjoyed a very good quarter from an orders perspective with a 2.3 to 1 book-to-bill. This is a very large, enduring backlog. And lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of $3.3 billion, which is up 8% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong first half of the year. That growth was spread pretty evenly between GDIT and mission systems. In fact, each business grew both year-over-year and sequentially.\nAt GDIT, we're seeing particular strength in the defense and federal civilian portfolios as our technology accelerator investments in capabilities like Zero Trust, artificial intelligence, digital engineering, and 5G are really resonating with customers and driving increased demand. At mission systems, the cyber and naval platform markets have been particularly strong. The production and delivery cadence on the hardware side appears to have stabilized, so we expect their results to be somewhat more predictable despite the lingering fragility in the supply chain that will continue to be the new normal. Based on the strength of the first three quarters, the group is on track to achieve our increased sales forecast of $12.7 billion for the year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $315 million, up 10.5%, yielding a margin of 9.5%. That's up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially.\nSo very solid performance on strong revenue growth in the quarter. This is the drumbeat we expect to see continue in the fourth quarter. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $12.7 billion. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1 to 1, keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. Prospects remain strong with a qualified funnel of over $125 billion in opportunities they're pursuing across the portfolio. Let me close with a review of the defense units in aggregate. As a whole, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, defense had revenue of $8.54 billion, up $911 million, or 11.9%, over the year-ago quarter. On the same basis, earnings of $826 million were up 32 million, or 4%. On a sequential basis, the pattern is similar. Revenue was up $340 million, or 4.1%, and earnings were up 57 million, or 7.4%.\nYear-to-date, against the same period last year, revenue of $24.7 billion was up 10.2%, and operating earnings were up $60 million, or 2.6%. In short, our defense businesses are experiencing significant growth in revenue and to a lesser degree in earnings. However, we need to continue to work with our supply chain in order to achieve appropriate operating leverage. So with that, let me turn it over to Bill.\n\nBill Moss\n\nVice President and Controller, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning. We had another very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall Book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 to 1 for the company. This was particularly impressive with the strong revenue growth in the quarter. Marine systems and aerospace led the way with Book-to-bill ratios of 2.3 and 1.4, respectively.\nFor the second quarter in a row, this led to record-level backlog of $95.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up 4.6% from last quarter and up 7.6% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter just shy of $133 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another strong story in the quarter with over $1.3 billion of operating cash flow. This brings us to $3.5 billion of operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.9 billion year-to-date, or 126% of net income through the first nine months. This conversion rate was achieved on the strength of the Gulfstream orders, additional scheduled progress payment on combat systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies.\nWe are well-positioned to achieve our target for the year of a cash conversion rate over 100% of net income. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $227 million in the quarter, or 2.1% of sales. For the first nine months, we're at 2% of sales. We're still targeting to be slightly below 2.5% of sales for the full year, so that implies an uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We paid $363 million in dividends and repurchased a little over a quarter million shares during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first nine months to $1.5 billion. We also repaid $500 million of debt that matured in August and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.3 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down nearly $1.4 billion from year-end.\nNet interest expense in the quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $265 million, down from $279 million for the same period in 2022. Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 15.6%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 16.2%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth. So no change to our outlook of 17% for the full year, which again implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Jason for some final remarks.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Bill. As far as year-end guidance is concerned, we're holding at $12.65 for the year.\nThere will be a number of puts and takes from what we published last quarter, but it should all come out about the same place. Nicole, that concludes our remarks, so I'll turn the call back to you.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, thank you. And as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star and then the number one on your telephone keypad. Pressing star one a second time will remove you from the queue. And we will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And we'll take our first question from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, Jason and Bill.\nJason, it sounds like there's just obviously a lot of moving parts for Q4 at Gulfstream. Is there a cutoff date if certification happens in December versus November about your ability to kind of push out those deliveries? And then any commentary on just I know you've had a long-term forecast of 170 deliveries for 2024, whether you still think that holds. Obviously, if certification slips, there'd be more potentially, but maybe just some commentary there. Thanks.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah, thanks, Peter. As it relates to certification, I think what we've said for some time now is that if we can achieve certification in the, call it, early to mid-December timeframe, then we've got a good shot at getting the planned deliveries of G700s out the door this year. Obviously, as that pushes further to the right, that puts that a little bit at risk.\nTo your point about 2024, probably not appropriate to get into specifics about next year until we go through our plan period, which we'll engage in coming up here in the next month or two. But I think the way to think about this is a lot of what we've been talking about this year between the supply chain challenges as well as the G700 cert timing is really timing issues. And to your point, to the extent some of the deliveries that we anticipated this year don't happen, that really just pushes into next year. So that naturally is an adder to the outlook for 2024. But what we can't do yet is declare victory on the supply chain issues and say that by early next year, they're going to be completely solved.\nSo a lot remains to be seen as to the timing of how that ultimately works itself out. And I think it's that that will determine the net impact of 2024. So I think a little bit more time is going to be needed to see between what pushes out of 2023 into 2024 and the timing of the supply chain fix, what the net impact is to that 2024 outlook. And I think we'll have a better sense of that when we come back to you with guidance in January.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nAppreciate the color. Thanks, Jason.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we will take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHey, Jason. So at the beginning of the year, you guys had forecasted marine and combat to be relatively flat.\nAt this point, we're looking at probably double-digit growth for both of those businesses this year. Does any of that, as we start thinking about how those businesses could look next year, does any of this represent any sort of pull forward that would potentially moderate the growth that we could see out of those two businesses next year?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So what I think as it relates to marine systems, David, nothing has really fundamentally changed from the narrative that we've talked about for some time, which is to expect roughly $400 million-$500 million on average per year, year-over-year growth in that business. Obviously, this year has turned out to be quite a bit different than we originally anticipated. And that's largely attributable to the increased throughput that we've seen at Electric Boat in particular as the hiring and retention dynamics have really improved faster than we thought.\nSo that's really driven a lot of the revenue acceleration into this year. That backlog is so large and so long-term, I don't really see that having a direct effect on next year or any given year. But obviously, again, we'll have to go through the specific planning period that we're about to engage in before we get too specific about next year. So we'll be back with more on that, but not a direct correlation in my mind from that marine systems increase in throughput. On combat systems, to your point, we had been expecting sort of flat to downish revenue before the threat environment really took a turn in the opposite direction. And as you've seen through the first part of the year, up 15% so far year-to-date, almost 25% in the quarter, that certainly was well beyond what our original expectations were.\nFrankly, we don't see that demand signal slowing down. When you think about the munitions side of the business, as well as the international demand we're seeing, along with the new program starts in the U.S., I don't necessarily see that as being a pull forward or something that creates a headwind into 2024. Again, not being specific about that outlook because we'll get into the planning period and get back to you in January.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nAs a follow-up, the IRS came out with an updated guidance on Section 174 R&D. What impact does that have on your cash flow outlook?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nReally, nothing other than what we've told you before. We've actually been pretty consistent on this throughout the drama on this issue over the years. We didn't originally anticipate the law to be changed. So our guidance was predicated on the law as it is.\nIt turned out not to be changed. Our expectation of what that would mean for us, ultimately, you can call it lucky or good, we expected the net impact from a cash perspective to be right on course with what we're seeing right now.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning, Jason and Bill. Morning. Maybe just start, Jason, again on Gulfstream. Last quarter, you called out sort of 19 as the expected 700 delivery number, depending upon cert timing this year. Is that still a number we should expect into the fourth quarter, assuming you get certification in time? And can you just comment on any potential risk around 280 production levels, considering some of the uncertainty in the Middle East?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah.\nSo as far as the G700 is concerned, 19 is the number that we have targeted and are still striving to get to. Again, as you note, that is predicated on timing of cert. What I can tell you in terms of a little bit of color behind that is we've got 15 of those 19 that are ready to go and are in good shape, and we're working toward the others. So again, predicated on when the cert comes, we should be in good shape to be somewhere in that range for deliveries this year. As it relates to the G280s, what I would tell you is the modest downtick that I talked about earlier this morning in terms of our overall 2024, excuse me, 2023 deliveries, that five or six aircraft reduction from our previous guidance in July, that is largely related to G280s.\nI would tell you that what we plan to deliver this year, we now have in hand at our Dallas facility for completion. So there's really not any incremental risk to 2023. We will have to see, obviously, how the events in Israel play out and what impact that may have in 2024, but a little premature to get into that at this point.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Jason.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we will take our next question from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, Rob.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nJason, on the supply chain, maybe I'm just reading too much into this. It sounds like it's actually got a bit worse than what you talked about last quarter. So let me see if you could elaborate on what you've been seeing, whether there are any specific pinch points that are causing you trouble.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nRob, I'm going to guess you're talking about supply chain and aerospace. And if so, I would tell you that actually we're seeing modest signs throughout the quarter that things are actually getting better. It's not, as you'd imagine, a straight line to the finish line on this issue. So there'll be some bumps in the road and some curves along the way. But things are starting to trend better. What we saw here was a specific issue in terms of, as I mentioned, G280s in terms of the reduced in-service aircraft production. But on the large cabin aircraft, we are starting to see things trend in the right direction. So I think it's a little bit maybe the other direction of what your intuition is pointing you to.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. Good to hear.\nJust as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could elaborate on where you stand on supply chain in, I think, mission systems had a few issues, and also in the labor situation at Marine, but that seems to have improved.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nSorry. I broke up there, Rob, at the end. You said mission system supply chain and then labor?\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nAt Marine.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nOh, labor at Marine. Okay. So on the mission system side, I feel very good about what they've done. The supply chain, to be completely candid with you, remains, and I think we expect to remain what I'd call fragile. Don't think that that's going to get back to what we saw pre-pandemic for the foreseeable future. But the fact is, the team at Mission Systems has fully incorporated that new reality into their outlook.\nSo I expect their future to be a lot more stable and predictable as they've incorporated the new normal, if you will, in supply chain on the electronic side for them. In terms of the labor side on marine systems, as I mentioned earlier, I think we've seen stabilization in both attraction and retention of labor in the shipyards at a faster rate than we anticipated. So that's an encouraging sign. That drives the throughput in the yard. Over time, as those new shipbuilders become more tenured, more experienced, more proficient, we would expect at that point that's one of the factors that will really drive over time the margin improvement in the shipyards. So it's an encouraging start for them. We've just got to see that play out because, as you know, shipbuilding is a long-term venture.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we will take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of A&D Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of A&D Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nJason, can you walk through some of the high-level puts and takes for aerospace incremental margins next year? And I guess maybe to ask another way, are the right things to focus on from our perspective? The G700 mix, less out-of-sequence work, the learning curve on G700, and then presumably R&D, either leveling off or coming down, or is there anything else here that we should be considering? Thank you.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nI'd say you nailed most of the high-level items there for next year. And again, the G700 is a big piece of it. Obviously, we've talked about how that'll come into service with favorable entry-level margins, accretive entry-level margins for the group. So that's a big driver.\nI think the other major one, and you alluded to it, really is the resolution and straightening out of the supply chain issues. One of the things Gulfstream has really worked toward here and planned toward, I think, very effectively, and we'll see it over time, is driving the efficiency of the operation with this new family of aircraft between the facilities that have been built, the commonality between the airplanes, the ability to service those airplanes efficiently. That is really what we are driving toward and one of the major underpinnings behind the long-term trajectory back to the mid-to-high teens margins for that group. Obviously, timing of when those things get straightened out in the supply chain will be important because that's really what's sort of inhibiting us getting to that point of efficiency. We will see a little bit of a modest downtick in R&D.\nI wouldn't call that a major factor, but you should expect to see that tick down a little as we finish up the 700 this year and get through the 800 next year, but again, have 800 and 400 to go. So we're not out of things yet from an R&D standpoint there. Those are the major puts and takes, I'd say. All in all, we would expect to see revenue, or excuse me, margin continuing on its trajectory, again, toward that mid-to-high teens rate. We'll see improvement here in the fourth quarter, and I expect to see good improvement in 2024.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of A&D Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Great. And then as a follow-up, are there any major company-funded growth CapEx projects still underway in 2024 and 2025, or is most of that complete this year?\nAnd if it does complete this year, does the nearly $1 billion of CapEx included in current Bloomberg Consensus for 2024 and 2025 make directional sense? Because that's basically still in line with 2023, I think. Thank you.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. The major internal CapEx projects are done this year. We've got a little bit of trailing costs and activity going on in the shipyards as we finish out that capacity expansion, particularly at Electric Boat, but that will wrap up next year. The investments we're making on the Army side from an artillery perspective, that's being funded by the customer. And so bottom line, we ought to see our CapEx level trend back toward 2%. We'll be below 2.5% this year, which is directionally in the right head of the right way. And we'll be back toward, if not at 2%, headed toward 2% next year.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, Jason and Bill. Good morning. Yeah. So maybe first on the president's $106 billion supplemental request, it includes $3.4 billion for the submarine industrial base. With this request out there now and with respect to AUKUS, can you talk more about what this means for GD? Does this change the timing at all?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nBottom line, Kristine, I think the short answer is no. Obviously, any additional support that can be provided in terms of that supplemental or other funding to shore up the industrial base is helpful. There's a lot of talk around AUKUS, and obviously, we're going to do everything we can to support our customer in that regard. But the fact is, this supply chain still remains very fragile.\nWe've got a lot of work to do to get this whole industry back to, from a submarine perspective, back to two per year. We got to get to that point on Virginia while delivering Columbia's, and I think we got some more work to do to get there. So any additional funding and support, whether it's through this supplemental or other Navy support, would be extremely helpful. But that's our focus today, is to get to that two per year plus Columbia, and then we'll look to AUKUS beyond that.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nFollowing up on your comments on the fragile supply chain, has there been changes in your contracting terms with the customer to reflect this? And how do we think about long-term margins?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nI think the main way this has been reflected in our contracting with the customer is to recognize the impacts that we've had, to price that in, and to accommodate what is the current state of affairs in our contracting. An example of that is the DDG multi-year that we just saw awarded in the quarter. We feel like that's been appropriately considered there, and we'll continue to consider the state that the industry is in as we go forward. I wouldn't point to necessarily any other macro or overarching contract structures or other terms that have changed. In terms of margins, we expect them to get better, frankly. My expectation is that this quarter would be the trough for the group. We expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see modest sequential incremental improvement over time in this group.\nThat said, this is a challenging task. Shipbuilding is a challenging endeavor, and so it's not going to be straightforward. But our expectation, to be completely straightforward, is to have gradual increasing margins in this group over time as we march back toward that 8%-9% plus margin range.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much. And good morning, everyone.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nGood morning, Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. Maybe just to follow up on that last topic, the Q3 margin in Marine, similar to Q1. In Q1, we know there were some charges on Virginia, I believe block four and block five. Were there significant negative EACs on Virginia in the third quarter that drove kind of the margin that we ended up seeing?\nAnd I guess kind of any—I know you talked about supply chain at Electric Boat, but any additional color about what assumptions have really changed there? And with the new assumptions, how that affects your ability to expand margins?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nSo in the quarter, Seth, nothing material in terms of EACs in the quarter. What you're seeing there, obviously, we are still experiencing pressure from delayed material coming out of the supply chain that's affecting Electric Boat's schedule, delivery, and man hour in the yard. But the other implication that you're seeing is having reduced the margin rates through the earlier EAC adjustments. We're now seeing the aggregate impact of that in the booking rates that we are recognizing on the programs today. So it's sort of the aggregate confluence of all those factors that are driving the margin rate that you see in the quarter.\nBut again, as we start to continue to improve the throughput and improve the efficiency in the yards, we do expect to see incremental improvement in the margin starting in fourth quarter. In terms of supply chain changes, I don't know that it's anything changing. I think it's as we go to contract, we have 20/20 hindsight or full visibility, if you will, into the current state of affairs. And so we're working through that with our customer, and they understand the situation we're in. So we're basically incorporating the current state of the supply chain as well as the implications of increasing cost of skilled labor, as you've seen with a lot of the labor negotiations going on out in the market.\nSo it's those types of factors that are being incorporated that we're putting into the new contracts and that we feel like will put us in a good position to perform from a margin perspective as we look ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Okay. Thanks. And then just for a clarification, when you talked about the overall company and despite some changes, the EPS outlook being unchanged, was that sort of—that was based on that new Gulfstream delivery outlook that you talked about with the 60+in Q4? If the G700 wasn't to be certified this year, I assume that that's kind of a different story. And kind of what's the last date that roughly that you could see that certification happen and still kind of deliver, I don't know, double-digit G700s?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So the EPS reaffirmed at $12.65 is based on the updated Gulfstream delivery number that I mentioned earlier.\nAs I said, that's mostly the reduced number from the July outlook; it is mostly associated with G280s, so not as significant an earnings impact to that. As you can imagine, some puts and takes, none of which are particularly material across the rest of the portfolio, including some upward pressure across the defense businesses from a revenue perspective, as you might imagine, improved customer service revenue at the aerospace group, and so on. Some below-the-line things like lower interest expense and share count, net-net kind of putting us in the same place. So that's sort of why the guidance stays where it is. In terms of the G700 outlook, I think the key issue is, and the question so many people have around why the uncertainty is, we don't have a date certain. This is the FAA's process. We need to let them go through that process.\nWe are supporting them in that process. They're going through flying now, and we're doing the necessary paperwork and reporting to support that. And so we have a path. We have an expectation to get there in early to mid-December, but there's not like a red line or a date certain on the calendar that we're looking at at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we will take our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nI wanted to go back to Marine because when you look at Electric Boat, I mean, your backlogs have built way up. As you mentioned, the Navy wants to be at two VCS deliveries per year. Can you describe what scenarios you can even look at here? I mean, my understanding is it's about 1.2 now. It's way off what clearly Congress wants, what the Navy wants.\nAre there scenarios that you think about in terms of how soon, in a good situation, we might get to that two per year? Or what would be a negative scenario? What's the range of outcomes here?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYou point out the landscape appropriately, Doug. I think the way I think about that is prior to COVID, if you look at the couple of quarters leading up to 2020, we were as a team, we were right on the threshold of getting to two per year on the Virginia-class program. So it is imminently doable in terms of the industrial base and the team that's working that program. Obviously, COVID set us on our heels as well as the generational changeover in shipbuilders in terms of retirements and new hires.\nI think the way to think about that now is there's a number of factors that are going to help us get back to that point. One is, again, the maturing and tenuring of that new workforce to get the efficiency in the workforce to get us back to where we were. The investments that the Navy is making in the industrial base, which are extremely helpful to stabilize that. And then other initiatives like what we call strategic sourcing, where we're trying to take bottlenecks out of the shipyards and move subsystem construction and capacity into other facilities and other yards around the country so that we can take some of the pressure off of the two main production and assembly yards. Those are the types of things that are going to drive us back toward two per year.\nI'd be remiss to try and give you a timeline on when it's going to be to get there. This is long-term, challenging stuff. But I think with us and our partner and the Navy all working in the same direction and in a very strong partnership, I feel optimistic about our path to get there.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nWell, and then as a follow-up, if you add one more factor into this, which is Columbia-class, obviously in a very different stage in the program, but also you've got an overlapping supply chain. How does progress on the Columbia-class right now look, and how does that affect your ability to push forward on this VCS ramp?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. Columbia-class, as you know, is the Navy and the DoD number one priority. So that's going to continue to be the case.\nI don't see that being a trade-off necessarily to get to two per year for Virginia. Right now, we're a little over 40% complete on the first boat, and we're right on schedule for the targeted completion of that first boat. We've still got, obviously, about four years to go before delivery, so a lot of the way to go, and a lot can happen between now and then. But all the resources that can be brought to bear are on that priority. I think the way to think about it is, because of its priority position, it is essentially a headwind to those other factors that I gave you about what we're trying to do on Virginia-class. And we got to be able to manage both of those within the yard, within the teaming arrangement, and with our customer.\nBut those are some of the puts and takes. Columbia will be the priority, and it's our job to make Virginia happen, notwithstanding that priority.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\ncai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes. Thank you very much and good quarter.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, Cai.\n\ncai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nSo, Jason, you said you're still looking for 12.7 in technologies. But when I look at all of your defense numbers, you really beat in revenues across the board. So maybe if you could kind of, if I look at where the model was before, it looks like we have a softer fourth quarter to get us home. But that doesn't seem realistic given the spectacular revenues you had here in the third quarter.\nSo maybe update us if you could on where you're looking for revenues in each of the defense sectors for the year, and should we feel a bigger step up next year?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nSo I think the way to think about the fourth quarter, Cai, is, as I alluded to earlier, there is obviously some upward pressure on the revenue on the defense side. Nothing to get too specific about. I don't know that it's particularly material with just a couple of months to go here in the year. One way to think about this is this year, let's talk group by group. In technologies, you may remember last year we had a significant surge in the fourth quarter because we had had a big backup on the supply chain side at mission systems through the third quarter, and a lot of that flowed through in the fourth quarter.\nReally a big hockey stick or upswing in fourth quarter. That's not the pattern this year. As I mentioned before, they've been on a more regular order and a more regular drumbeat. So we'll see a more steady-state revenue pattern for technologies in fourth quarter. In combat, likewise, it's historically for some time now been sort of the traditional seasonal pattern for combat to rise throughout the year and have its biggest quarter in fourth quarter. We saw that again last year. In this case, in 2023, it's a much more steady drumbeat. Again, steady demand, strong volume, but not the traditional sort of seasonal fourth quarter uptick in combat. In Marine, again, we've already seen tremendous volume, well in excess of our expectations.\nWe're up $1 billion almost through the first nine months, which is roughly what we expect for the year. And so, again, I'd say more stable quarter to quarter. So to summarize, we're seeing more stable volumes across all three of the defense segments from first quarter to fourth quarter, whereas in the past, they've risen from first to fourth. So a little bit of an aberration in the pattern. I do expect, again, not to get ahead of the planning process we're going through, but I expect each of the businesses to show growth going into next year. Can't get too much more specific about that at this point, but you should see growth in the defense business across all three of the segments going into 2024.\n\ncai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nVery helpful. And then maybe a quick comment on Israel-Hamas has created additional demand.\nWe have this $106 billion request from the president. Can you give us some general color in terms of areas where you think you could see incremental acceleration in demand?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThe Israel situation, obviously, is a terrible one, frankly, and one that's just sort of evolving as we speak. But I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of that, the biggest one to highlight and that really sticks out is probably on the artillery side. Obviously, that's been a big pressure point up to now with Ukraine, one that we've been doing everything we can to support our army customer. We've gone from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000 very quickly. We're working ahead of schedule to accelerate that production capacity up to 85,000, even as high as 100,000 rounds per month.\nI think the Israel situation is only going to put upward pressure on that demand. So that's the biggest standout that I can see.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics\n\nAbby, I think we have time for just one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nExcellent. Thank you. We will take our final question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey. Good morning.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning, Ron.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nMaybe just two. Right. On land systems, given truly the surge in demand relative to where everybody thought it would be, from a capacity point of view, from a labor point of view, how are you guys set up there to handle it all?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nI have to give a hand to the guys in the combat systems group in general and land systems specifically. You've really not heard us talk about supply chain bottlenecks, labor capacity, or other issues in that group.\nAnd that does not mean they have not faced them. They stand out amongst even a spectacular crowd in the way they've handled it. So I don't have any expectation that we'll see any issues as we look ahead, even as the demand for their product, both here, U.S. domestically, as well as internationally, continues to grow.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd then maybe just changing gears a bit. Nobody really asked a heck of a lot about GDIT.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you for that. Finally.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nLet's talk about that. It's a big piece of the company, right? You know a lot about it, right, in particular. So when we think about a path to double-digit margins, how do we get there? And then maybe from an operational point of view, why does not integrating mission and GDIT together kind of make sense? Because there's this bigger demand for software-driven solutions and software and hardware.\nYou're seeing this synergy coming out, particularly with the application of AI to legacy systems and so on and so forth.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So on the margin side, just to be clear, as I think about double-digit margin for the group, not specifically GDIT, it's the mix of the two of them together. I absolutely expect this group to be on the march back to low double-digit margin. It's where they've been historically. I think if anything I could articulate as a headwind to that, it's to the extent that the GDIT side grows faster than the Mission Systems side. That obviously creates a bit of a macro mix issue that could be a little bit of a headwind in terms of how long it takes us to get there. But frankly, I expect to see us get back into the double-digit margin range here in fourth quarter.\nAnd we'll see how quickly we can get there in the outlook as we look at 2024 and beyond. But I do expect them to get back on the trajectory toward low double-digit margin. In terms of integration, the way we see this is these are, while they're very symbiotic businesses and they are dealing with a market that's dealing with a convergence, to your point, in terms of their capabilities, we think that having them separate is appropriate because the investment thesis and the way you run an inherently people business versus an inherently technology development hardware and production business are fundamentally different and take different leadership, different priorities, and sort of different investment thesis. The good news is that by having them together in the same group and in a coordinated way, we are making investments and addressing the evolving technologies jointly as a group.\nAnd we are making sure we're being efficient at that and effective at that, not duplicative, not missing anything, and bringing the requisite skills, to your point, from end to end, whether it's the hardware side, the services, the software capabilities, solutions as a service, software solutions, and so on, together in joint capability. So I think we get the best of both worlds that way in terms of the way we manage and run the businesses, but also the way we can bring combined capability to the customer set.\n\nNicole Shelton\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Dynamics",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Rubel\n\nVP of General Dynamics and Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Q2 2023 earnings conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our longtime board member and Lead Director, Jim Crown. Jim has a record of distinguished service on the GD Board for over 35 years. Throughout that time, Jim provided guidance to more than five different management teams. We mourn his passing and our prayers are with his family.\nEarlier this morning we reported earnings of $2.70 per diluted share on revenue of $10.2 billion, operating earnings of $962 million, and net income of $744 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments. Importantly, we had a 12% revenue increase across the defense segments with a more modest 4.6% increase at Aerospace while revenue is up by $963 million or 10.5%. Operating earnings are down $16 million and net earnings are down $22 million against last year's second quarter. So we had significant revenue increase but lower operating margin against the year ago quarter. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.14 per share on significantly higher revenue and modestly lower operating margin than anticipated. By the sell-side, the earnings beat was exclusively operations driven. We enjoyed very nice sequential improvement.\nRevenue was up $271 million and operating earnings are up $24 million on identical operating margins on a year-to-date basis. Revenue of $20 billion is up $1.45 billion or 7.8% over last year's first half. Operating earnings of $1.9 billion are up less than 1% and net earnings are down $22 million, largely as a result of below-the-line items including a higher provision for income taxes. As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after capital expenditures in the quarter continued at a very good pace for the first half. Free cash flow is 123% of net income. Obviously, we are off to a very good start from a cash perspective. As is clear from the press release, we also had a powerful order quarter across the business, extending our already large backlog. Jason will provide full color around that item as well.\nIn summary, this is from a revenue perspective, a very strong quarter and a good first half. Supply chain issues and past Covid labor issues have impacted operating margins, but there is relief in sight. We expect improvement as we progress.\nAt this point, let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong order activity, growing backlog, and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the technologies group in the quarter.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 to 1 for the company. Order activity was strong across the board as each segment had a book-to-bill of one to one or greater in the quarter. This is quite impressive in light of the strong revenue growth. Combat Systems and Aerospace did particularly well with book-to-bills of 1.4x and 1.3x, respectively. This led to record-level backlog of $91.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up 1.7% from last quarter and up 4.3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $129 billion.\nTurning to our cash performance for the quarter, we generated $731 million of operating cash flow, which, following our strong first quarter performance, brings us to $2.2 billion for the first six months of the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $519 million for the quarter and over $1.8 billion year to date, yielding a cash conversion rate of 123% for the first half. This conversion rate reflects continued strong cash performance in aerospace and technologies and a particularly strong start for the year for the Combat Systems Group from payments received on our large international vehicle programs. The year to date results are consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.\nNow turning to capital deployment, capital expenditures were $212 million, or 2.1% of sales in the quarter, which brings us to 1.9% of sales for the first six months. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be higher in the second half of the year, but in line with our expectation to be just under 2.5% of sales for the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $360 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of stock for $288 million. That brings year to date repurchases to 1.8 million shares for $378 million. We also repaid $750 million of debt that matured in May and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down nearly $700 million from year end.\nAs a reminder, we have an additional $500 million maturing in Q3 that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million, compared to $95 million last year. That brings the interest expense for H1 to $180 million, down from $193 million for the same period in 2022. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $360 million. Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%, bringing the tax rate for H1 to 16.5%. There's no change to our outlook for the full year of approximately 17%, but of course that implies a rate in the mid-17% range for H2.\nTo shape that for you, we'd expect the rate to be somewhat lower in Q3 and higher in Q4 due to typical timing items.\nNow turning to operating performance in technologies, it was another solid quarter with revenue of $3.2 billion, which is up 7% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong start to the year we saw in the first quarter. In fact, each business grew year-over-year both in the quarter and the first half. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect, so we feel good about their prospects for the balance of the year. GDIT had another solid quarter. In fact, their highest second quarter revenue since before the pandemic as they continue to deliver on their steady year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings in the quarter were $283 million, yielding a margin of 8.8%.\nAs you know, margins are driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume and in this case were further impacted by the mix of new start programs that are driving the strong growth trajectory.\nBacklog grew during the quarter with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 to 1 on solid order activity that outpaced the strong revenue growth across the business. In fact, GDIT booked the highest first-half orders they've seen since mid-2019 and their pipeline remains robust with $20 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $81 billion in qualified opportunities identified.\nNow let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments and give an update on our guidance for 2023.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThanks, Jason. Now let me continue to review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide color as appropriate, and guidance for the full year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.95 billion and operating earnings of $236 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue is $86 million more than last year's second quarter on the strength of additional new aircraft deliveries coupled with higher Gulfstream service center volume partially offset by less volume in Jet Aviation's completion center. The 24 deliveries are modestly fewer than planned and are a result of supply chain issues. On the good news side of the equation, supply chain conditions are improving. We still have a significant backlog of late parts, but processes are in place to catch up. Deliveries are trending positive, and we have greater transparency.\nIn short, the suppliers are more predictable and are complying with catch up schedules. This will help both revenue and margins as we do less out of station work. Operating earnings of $236 million were 3% behind last year's second quarter as a result of a 60 basis points reduction in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was off largely as a result of the supply chain issues, and higher R&D expense. The shortage of parts continues to cost significant out of station work impacting efficiency. As mentioned earlier, we see improvement here and that should help as we go through the second half sequentially. Aerospace had a 3.2% increase in revenue and a 3.1% increase in operating earnings on identical operating margins.\nMoving to the demand environment, Aerospace had a very good quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3 to 1 in dollar terms and even higher for Gulfstream Aircraft alone. Vibrant sales activity and strong pipeline replenishment were evident in the quarter. The US, particularly large corporations, led the way with the Middle East, and Asia participating to a lesser degree.\nThe G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress. The aircraft design, manufacturing, and the overall program are very mature. However, we now target certification in Q4 and see no major obstacles in our path. To give you a little more insight, we will complete our FAA Type Inspection Authorization in September. This is the flying we are required to do pursuant to FAA requirement and plan. When we are finished, the FAA will fly some confirmatory flight tests to verify portions of our results. That will be followed by a brief period of paper submission followed by FAA review. As most of you know, we had planned to deliver a considerable number of G700s in Q3 and Q4. That has now slipped into Q4.\nWe now expect to deliver 27 aircraft in Q3 with a rapid increase in Q4 deliveries. In short, we are making good progress under difficult circumstances. However, we expect to deliver five to six fewer aircraft than the 145 we forecast at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we expect more service revenue than initially anticipated. I'll have more on this later in my remarks. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.92 billion, up a stunning 15.5% over the year ago quarter with growth at each of the business units. Earnings of $251 million are up 2.4%. Margins at 13% represent 170 basis points reduction over the year ago quarter. So we saw powerful revenue performance coupled with more modest operating margin in large part attributable to MICs.\nThe increase in revenue came from international vehicle programs at both land systems and European land systems. OTS has also enjoyed higher artillery program volume, including programs to expand production capacity for the US Government. These programs carry dilutive margins but will result in more production at accretive margins over time. On a sequential basis, revenue is up $168 million or 9.6%, and earnings are up $6 million or 2.4% on 100 basis point reduction in margin for the reasons described. Year to date, revenue is up $339 million or 10.1%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 5.1%. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in 1.4-to-1 book-to-bill, evidencing strong demand for munitions and domestic combat vehicles. International programs also contributed to the strong book-to-bill, so a very exciting first half for combat.\nTurning to marine systems once again. Our shipbuilding group is demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.1 billion is up $408 million, a robust 15.4% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth and, to a lesser degree, TAO growth. Operating earnings are $235 million, up $24 million over the year ago quarter, with a 30 basis points decrement in operating margin. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. On a sequential basis, revenue is up $67 million or 2.2%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 11.4% on a 60 basis points improvement in margin. For the first half, revenue is up $749 million or 14%, and earnings are up $24 million or 5.7%. So a good quarter and first half.\nSo let me move on to give you our updated forecast for the year. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won't repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to all of this, which will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, revenue will be down almost $200 million due to the five or six fewer aircraft deliveries, offset in part by stronger service activity. So look for revenue of $10.2 billion. We also expect margins to be down from a projected 14.6% to 14.1%. This implies operating earnings of $1.4 billion. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems will have revenue of $400 to 500 million higher than previously projected due to new program starts and an increased threat environment. So look for the total revenue of around $7.75 billion.\nMargins will be down 50 basis points from 14.7% to 14.2% on mix. All-in operating earnings will be up 25 million over the previous forecast.\nMarine Systems revenue should be up $900 million or $1 billion on acceleration of work throughout the yards. This is a leading indicator of improving efficiency. So we will have annual revenue around $11.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.6%. For the reasons I have previously described to you, operating earnings for the year should be up $20 million over the previous forecast. Technologies revenue will be $100 to 200 million, better than previous guidance. But operating margin will be 9.4%, 10 basis points lower than previously forecast. So for the group we expect annual revenue about $12.7 billion with operating earnings around $1.2 billion, steady with prior guidance. There is some opportunity here to capture 10 to 20 basis points of margin. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue higher than our initial guidance and an overall operating margin about 40 basis points lower.\nSo look for total revenue to be around $42.45 billion, about $1.2 billion up from previous guidance. Operating earnings should be down modestly from prior guidance, but below-the-line items and lower share count. We'll leave our EPS guidance the same.\nOne final note before I conclude my comments. Howard has informed the company that he intends to retire later this year. So this will be his last earnings call. We are grateful for the excellent work that Howard has done since joining our team. I hope many of you will join me in congratulating Howard on a job well done. Nicole Shelton, whom some of you know already, will be taking over the mantle with the third quarter call. That concludes my remarks and we will be happy to take your questions.\n\nHoward Rubel\n\nVP of General Dynamics and Investor Relations\n\nThank you for your kind words and friendship. It's been a pleasure and a great experience to have had the opportunity to represent General Dynamics to the investment community. These nearly six years, I have grown working side by side with many of the talented people of this tremendous enterprise. I look forward to working with Nicole over the next few months to ensure there are proper introductions and a seamless transition. There will be time ahead to say goodbye, but today I want to say thank you. Now let's turn to the question and answer period of this call. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. And again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much. Good morning and congratulations, Howard. Thanks for everything.\nJust on the new aerospace guidance, I guess maybe if you could walk through how you thought about the setup for that. And I appreciate that this is mainly a timing issue and that any airplanes that don't get delivered in 2023 can kind of move to 2024. But just kind of the way we get level set. With 27 deliveries in the third quarter, we're talking about something quite high to get to 140-ish for the year. And also, I mean with 27 deliveries, I assume we'll be looking at a margin in Q3 that's probably still in the 12s. And so also getting to 14.1 for the year.\nMaybe you can talk a little bit about the margin, the initial margin accretion from the new aircraft, and what that contribution will be to the total deliveries.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah, so I think you've, you've put your finger on a nub of an issue. So what we have given you with respect to aerospace is Gulfstream's plan. The guidance that we gave you reflects their plan. Our January guidance, just for context, contemplated a very high Q4 delivery rate. That rate increased with the certification delay on the 700. The 700 will be fully built and ready for delivery. Remember too, our new planes are all built in purpose-built facilities. We've expanded our wing line. In short, we facilitize for increased production, and finally the fact that we have planes, and you can see this from the increase in inventory, that are waiting parts. We now have a schedule, and all of that taken together allows us to, will give us the ability to deliver with respect to margin.\nWe've got a number of higher margin airplanes, as you would expect, delivering in the Q4. So that provides significant uplift. So we kind of explain how we intend to get the revenue through the deliveries. And the margin is really a question of mix of the higher deliveries of higher margin, greater deliveries of higher margin airplanes.\nGreat. Okay, thank you. And just to follow up real quick on this topic, you know, the 27 deliveries in Q3 would be down year on year. And so in terms of, you know, there's the issue of the G700 certification which we're all kind of, you know, looking at and it's hard to analyze. But just from the non, for the non G700 deliveries, is there any risk around what the plan was there and what Gulfstream expects to do?\nSo as I noted in my remarks, our supply chain is increasing its transparency, improving its processes, and we have reliable, increasingly reliable schedules. That said, they're likely. We anticipate more catch up in the fourth quarter, which will allow us to complete a number of those airplanes, but they're still impacting the third quarter deliveries.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nThanks very much. Good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nI can't believe Howard's retiring. He's so young.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThat's what we say.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nAnyway, I've got a couple of questions for you, Phebe. First of all, on the revised aerospace guidance, you mentioned that you've increased your expectations for services for the full year. I wonder if you could square this with what we've been seeing in bizjet flight hours year-to-date, which have been down year-on-year. And then secondly, a great Combat Systems order quarter. But how do you expect these orders to flow through to revenue growth over the next couple of years? Thank you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nOur flying hours are not down.\nBut I think, too, the way to think about our service business is we expect service to increase as the fleet of airplanes, new airplanes in the market, increases. So we expect steady growth in service. And we haven't seen any impact so far on any change in flying hours. And I said that's mostly other people's flying hours. With respect to combat, the world has become a less safe place. And that's really reflected in an increased demand both internationally and in the United States. So we expect.\nThis year to be considerably higher than last year. We'll give you clarity around 2024.\nIn January. But as you may recall, we had anticipated flat to down growth in this business segment. Clearly that trajectory has changed. We won't be able to quantify. We can't quantify it right now, but we'll give you more clarity on that.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of David Strauss from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThanks.\nGood morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nHi, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGood morning, Phebe. So back on the G700.\nWould you expect to make up the missed deliveries?\nThis year? Would you expect them to, you know, to make those up next year? So, does the, I think, what was 170 go higher in terms of what you're expecting for deliveries next year?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell, we'll get into next year, but the deliveries are lower, are five to six. Deliveries that won't deliver this year are not G700s. So it's other airplanes.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nOkay, got it.\nAnd then as a follow up, quick follow up, Combat Systems, you mentioned this during the prepared remarks. The lower margins in the quarter and then it looks like you're forecasting a bit of a snapback in the second half of the year, but still a fair amount lower than what you were initially forecasting. Can you just give a little more detail on the mix and how that's impacting things? Thanks.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYes. So mix in this instance is comprised of two elements. One, the capacity expansion, which I noted carries lower margin. And then it's really the transition from more mature programs to newer programs. And those margins will improve as we come down our learning curve.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nTerrific. Thanks so much. So, and Howard, let me say you've been terrific to work with and a great friend, and wish you all the best.\n\nHoward Rubel\n\nVP of General Dynamics and Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Cai.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nSo Phoebe.\nHow many 700s are you assuming deliver in Q4 and what kind of margin for error is there in terms of timing?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWe will deliver 19 G700s and we're not going to tell you. Margins will be accretive.\nNice try. When have we ever given you margins by airplane?\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nNo, no. I didn't mean, I meant, you know, how much time-wise cushion you have in the schedule if the certification slips.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYou mean the schedule for the G700 certification?\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes, I mean, is your best guess that you certify in the middle of November, in December? Middle of December, you know, which could impact the amount number of planes you get out.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nBut so what we've told you is our best estimate right now of the certification process. Clearly, if it comes very late in the year, we'll deliver airplanes, but we won't necessarily be able to deliver all of them. That'll bleed over into the best first quarter GD has ever had in its history.\nBut we're not anticipating that at the moment. So I don't have real good clarity, because we don't know yet with precision on when in the Q4. But our best estimate, what we're planning for right now, is that we will be able to have sufficient time to deliver these airplanes. Remember, they're built, the pilot training will start, and that will help significantly with deliveries.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. And with all of these deliveries in the Q4, maybe Jason, can you give us some color in terms of the cash flow profile? I mean, do we have just a momentous Q4 cash, and is there any upside to the 105%?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThe way I think you need to think about that, Kai, is when it comes to Gulfstream, we have a sequence of progress payments that occurs from the time of the initial order through delivery and entry into service. So, the vast majority of the cash receipts associated with an aircraft order, an aircraft delivery are in-house before the actual airplane is delivered. So, while there's obviously an implied set of progress payments, final delivery payments would occur at that point when those aircraft enter into service. It's not an outsized level of cash one way or the other.\nSo the bigger issue is you've got an ongoing sequence and series of progress payments associated with all of the orders in the order book and with a significant order volume that we've had over the past two, two and a half years, that is sort of a machine that's just churning those progress payments over time. As we continue to make progress on each of those airplane builds as well as the certification process.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning and congratulations on retirement, Howard. I'll miss you. In terms of the outlook for aerospace orders. Could you just comment, Phoebe, what you're seeing for the rest of the year? Obviously, the second quarter was probably helped a little bit because of the anomaly you mentioned in March around the banking crisis. And then also, if you can comment on churn in the backlog, I think your net book-to-bill was a couple hundred million lighter than your gross book-to-bill. So maybe just talk about any cancellations.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah, so the demand in the second quarter was at the same level as the demand in the first quarter. It felt very, very similar. As you quite rightly note, we had a three-week hiatus coincident with the mini banking crisis, but the demand levels have remained about the same. And as we entered Q3, we have a very strong pipeline.\nSo far activity is quite good. In Q3.\nWe had six defaults in the quarter.\nNothing that is notable to us. The backlog is holding up very, very well.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning. Congrats, Howard. Look forward to getting some postcards from far and distant places.\nJust sticking with Gulfstream for one last question. Hopefully, here on the pipeline and kind of what you see from a bottom-up perspective. Can you give us a little flavor from a geographic perspective and customer type? How's high net worth doing versus corporate? And are we beginning to see some green shoots in geographies outside the United States?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nYeah. So the United States was strong, has been strong, particularly with the Fortune 500s. I would say that high net worth is about the same, and the Middle East is pretty good, as is Asia. But it's really the Fortune 500 that are really driving the demand. These are long established customers as well as new Fortune 500 customers.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nOkay, great. And then Jason, over to you on technologies. It sounds like you've got a robust pipeline of opportunities in front of you. Can you talk a little bit about the mix of that? We had some margin degradation here in the quarter. I'm just kind of curious, as you look out at that pipeline, do you see anything that would suggest we're going to see a departure in any, you know, either higher or lower from a margin perspective as you bid on this work and bring it in?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nI think bottom line, the short answer to that is no. We don't see any fundamental change. As we've talked about, you're going to see some level of aggregate margin perturbation between the two businesses. You know, IT services side being somewhat lower obviously than the hardware side. I think in this quarter we saw it a little more pronounced because as we're seeing this turn for the group to a stronger growth level, a lot of that is driven by not only new starts, but it's actually replacement contracts or I should say recompetes that we've won. So you had in the prior year the trailing off of very mature level legacy contracts that were closing out at higher margin rates as compared to the entry level margin rates we're seeing now. So that's sort of the driver of the year over year delta that you're seeing.\nBut barring any major structural shift between the percentage contributions of the IT services versus defense hardware parts of the business, we continue to expect this to be a low double-digit margin business over time.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning and ditto Cai's remarks. Howard, you will be missed. It's been a pleasure working with you.\nSo quickly, a couple questions on technologies. What should we be looking for? I mean, sometimes the contracts there aren't as.\nObvious on the horizon. So Jason, what should we be looking out for in the second half of the year? Potential things you guys could win.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nYou know, Ron, it's always tough in this business to point to a singular event or contract that is going to drive the overall business. As you know, it's a wide portfolio of literally thousands of contracts. I think the thing I would tell you is when you look at.\nMission Systems, on the one hand, they are really seeing strong support in their, what I'd call, their Navy platform support businesses. Whether it's the strategic side or the mission computing side. They're also seeing really great support in their cyber portfolio. So those are two areas I would expect to see continued growth in particular out of that business. When you look at GDIT, they're seeing strength in all three of their customer segments, the defense, the intelligence community, and the FedCiv side. So really good across the board support in GDIT. And I think if I could point to any one thing in particular on that side of the portfolio. We've talked for the past few weeks, couple months about some selective technology investments they've been making to accelerate their growth. And we're seeing that really start to take hold.\nAnd of course we're talking about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, hybrid cloud, zero trust, and so on. And that's really starting to bear fruit. We've seen already several hundred million dollars' worth of award wins as well as organic growth on existing contracts that's resulting directly from those investments. They've got some $7 billion and change in post-submittal submissions that are awaiting award decisions. And they've got another 20-plus, I think, between $20 and $25 billion of opportunities in the pipeline that are directly tied to those targeted investments. So I think some really intelligent capital allocation over there at GDIT to try and drive that growth and we'd expect to see continue in the second half of the year and beyond.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, great. And then maybe one follow on for Phoebe. When we think about Aero, when things start to normalize, right? Supply chain kind of gets back to a normal cadence and all that, what should we be thinking about broadly as like a realistic margin target?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWe're thinking in the higher teens.\nWhen we get on a steady state with upside potential.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your line is open.\n\nLouie DiPalma\n\nEquity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nPhebe, Jason, and Howard, good morning.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nMorning.\n\nLouie DiPalma\n\nEquity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nHoward, thank you for your deep aerospace defense expertise in your current position and your former position on the sell side. Your high standards raise the level of those around you.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nWell said.\n\nLouie DiPalma\n\nEquity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nFor Jason. For the Army's CHS-6, $8 billion recompete that should be announced I think very soon. General Dynamics Mission Systems is teaming with GDIT. Do you feel these synergistic joint bids between it and Mission will become more common and a significant strategic advantage for you? And could it help return the overall technology segment to mid-single digit growth over the long term?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nAgain, bottom line answer. You kind of hit the nail on the head there. We absolutely expect the synergistic benefits of these two businesses working together to be to our benefit over the long run.\nThe predicate for all that is that what we've seen both in the customer demand environment, what they're requiring in terms of end-to-end solutions, including both software services and the hardware elements of what we provide, we're seeing the peer group migrate that way with some of their M&A activities that you've seen in the market. And so we believe that is the thesis that we'll see play out. You noted CHS-6. We're obviously participating in and anticipating that resolution to that competition. We've seen that program migrate over time from one that was traditionally a very much focused on high-end customized ruggedized hardened type defense hardware to one that is a combination of that type of capability as well as a more traditional sort of off-the-shelf, catalog type product.\nSo we believe that having the attributes of both GDIT and Mission Systems involved in that program would be the best suited to serve our customer there. That's just one good example of it. Absolutely we see that over time and, and as far as long-term growth rates, we'll have to see where this leads. Right now we continue to track low to mid single digit, but we'll see if we can't get some juice out of that over time. Great. Thanks everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Howard. Exactly what Louie said. Then thank you for being such a great colleague and a teacher to me and all those around you. So thank you, Phebe or Jason, or whoever on the defense business. When you look at your 2023 guidance, defense growth is up solidly, up 5% for the year versus the 9% growth you did in the first half. But this is not necessarily leading to operating leverage with margin contraction of 40 basis points and flat operating profit. So how do you think about the return to operating margin expansion either on a total company level or a segment basis? It seems like technologies is more temporary. Combat mix maybe continues for some time.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo.\nTechnologies and combat are simply a question of mix. I suspect combat will quickly return to its normal operating leverage. The Marine group has significant.\nSupply chain challenges that have impacted, for the Virginia-class in particular. That's gonna to take some time to resolve. We'll talk about that in a little bit more detail. So as I noted, we expect.\nSlow quarter-over-quarter margin growth in the Marine group, perhaps an occasional perturbation by quarter, but slow steady improvement over time.\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning, everybody, and congratulations, Howard.\nHey, Phebe. I just wanted to dig into Marine again a little deeper. The full-year guide implies a pretty significant deceleration in growth into the back half of the year. Two questions really. First, you know, as we go back six months, you were talking about a much more conservative outlook for the top line in Marine, and clearly maybe any comments on really what's changed? Because the first half has really been much stronger than expected. But then also as you think about the remainder of the year, what will drive the significant step down, and how much conservatism does the Marine outlook reflect in terms of the growth?\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nGrowth in the quarter was driven by increased volume on Columbia and on the oiler program, as well as additional throughput throughout each one of those yards, which is often a precursor to better margin performance. Finally, just revenue came in faster than we had anticipated, really across the board. That will drive our expectations with respect to the margin performance.\nWe have. Columbia is doing very well. We've got nice performance on the Oiler. We see some deck plate improvements at Bath, but that has yet to translate into.\nFinancial performance.\nElectric Boat needs to continue to get better to offset likely additional supply chain challenges as the Virginia supply chain begins to improve. With respect to that supply chain, we see improvements in some very nice improvement in some area. But that supply chain was hit hard by COVID, and I think a little bit of extra explanation there is helpful. COVID impacted that supply chain, VA supply chain in particular, in a couple of ways. Obviously the impact of COVID itself, the workforce disruption. Then we had the large demographic changeover, and finally Virginia was impacted by the Columbia prioritization. All of that made it difficult for that supply chain to begin to get back on cadence. They're getting better, but we got a while to go before they hit their two a year or more cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line: Peter Arment from Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Congrats, Howard. Hey, Phebe. Within combat, you know, munitions kind of is kind of viewed as a potential source of kind of upside volume. And thanks for all the color on the segment, but how should we be thinking about the munitions growth profile? I mean, it's about finished last year, about 27% of your mix. Do you expect that mix to continue to grow? And any comments on the supply chain there as my follow up? Just because I know there's been talk about challenges there. Thanks.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nThe supply chain in the combat group has been less of an issue. I suspect that.\nAt least for the foreseeable future, the munitions portion of the business will remain about the same. As we see uplift in all of our three businesses, we'll see OTS at about that same level. We've already increased munitions capacity, and working with the federal government, the army, and OSD in particular, we have a very detailed plan to further increase capacity, which will allow us then to increase production very rapidly and move to the left the munition availability to meet the United States' needs and frankly external needs as well.\nThanks, Levi.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nWe'll just take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question for today comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Shapiro Research\n\nGood morning, and congratulations, Howard. I didn't figure I'd outlast you, but we've known each other a lot of years, and it's been a pleasure.\n\nHoward Rubel\n\nVP of General Dynamics and Investor Relations\n\nGeorge, it's over 40 just. But who's counting?\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Shapiro Research\n\nThat's right.\n\nHoward Rubel\n\nVP of General Dynamics and Investor Relations\n\nGeorge.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Shapiro Research\n\nPhebe, on the defaults that you mentioned, can you just?\nMention what kind of customers they might have been? I assume you keep the down payments that might have been made on the aircraft that they ordered.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nChairman and CEO, General Dynamics\n\nSo I think, you know, we have very strong terms and conditions that you forfeit.\nSome of your value in the airplane when you cancel. I don't actually know the context of the default.\nNothing that was of note or interest, otherwise I'd know it.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Shapiro Research\n\nOkay. And Jason, the unbilled receivables was actually up like $100 million sequentially. So does that mean you didn't get any payments from the expected customers in the quarter? And how much would you expect the rest of the year to come in?\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nActually, George, we did receive additional payments on schedule, as per the plan that was set forth several years ago. And I'm actually happy to tell you that at this point, and maybe this terminates this line of dialogue for the foreseeable future, the arrears that you all may remember from many years ago on that Canadian International Program has now effectively been paid down. And we are down to what I would call a normal run rate of operating working capital on that program.\nSo I'm pleased to report that we've passed through that phase in terms of what we expect to receive for the balance of the year. There are some more progress payments to come in, but I don't have that quantified off the top of my head.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Shapiro Research\n\nI mean, you had kind of given what the specifics were on that in the queue.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nWe'll follow up on that.\n\nGeorge Shapiro\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Shapiro Research\n\nYep.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nEVP of Technologies and CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThat now ends the call.\nFor those that are interested in connecting later, we'll have follow-up questions. Please don't hesitate to call me. Thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. And as I said, if you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Rubel\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.\nOn the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nThank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.64 per diluted share on revenue of $9.9 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is up $489 million or 5.2% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $30 million and net earnings are flat against the year ago quarter. This increase in operating earnings was offset by a $31 million increase in the tax provision.\nRecall that the first quarter 2022 tax provision was only 14%. Nevertheless, earnings per share are up $0.03 as a result of the stronger operating earnings and a lower share count. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.5%, 20 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This reflected lower operating margins in Aerospace and Marine, which I will address in some detail later in these remarks. Revenue was $489 million better than first quarter '22. All of the defense units were up and Aerospace down slightly, less than 1% on fewer aircraft deliveries. We beat consensus by $0.05 per share. We have roughly $550 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and lower-than-anticipated margins, leading to operating earnings basically consistent with expectations. The earnings per share beat was largely attributable to below the line items.\nAs Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after CapEx was very strong. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in '22 and not at all typical for us in the first quarter. Obviously, we were off to a very good start from a cash perspective. This is an important respects, a strong quarter, a good foundation for the year, subject to some supply chain issues that I will try to eliminate as we discuss the business segments.\nAt this point, let me ask Jason to provide detail on our order activity, solid backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter.\n\nJason Aiken\n\nSVP, CFO, General Dynamics\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.9:1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group, which had a book-to-bill of 1.5x. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $89.8 billion, off 1.4% from the end of last year, but up 3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $128 billion.\nTurning to our cash performance for the quarter. It was another exceptional start to the year, with operating cash flow of $1.46 billion, representing 200% of net income. This very strong cash flow was heavily loaded in the last few weeks of the quarter. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a cash conversion rate of 178%. While we continue to enjoy strong cash performance in Aerospace & Technologies, the Combat Systems group, in particular, delivered outstanding free cash flow this quarter. As expected, the U.K. resumed payments on the AJAX program. This coupled with the ongoing progress payments on our other large international vehicle program drove the group's cash performance. This is consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.\nNow turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $161 million or 1.6% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $345 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 400,000 shares of stock for $90 million at just over $220 per share. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2 billion and a net debt position of $8.5 billion, down nearly $800 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter and we are in a position to pay that down with the cash on hand following the receipts at the end of the first quarter.\nOur net interest expense in the quarter was $91 million compared to $98 million last year. Benefiting from the debt repayment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, we had a 17% effective tax rate in the quarter, consistent with our full year guidance.\nNow turning to operating performance in Technologies. We're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was up 2.5% over the prior year, modestly ahead of our expectations for the start of the year. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect, which gives us confidence about their outlook for the balance of the year. And GDIT had their highest quarterly revenue and earnings in 4 years as they continue to deliver on their year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings of $299 million were consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%.\nAs we discussed in January, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume. Backlog grew during the quarter with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1 on strong order activity in IT services that included some important wins not yet factored into the backlog. This includes the Army's flight test school training support services contract valued at $1.7 billion. And Air Force IDIQ with a total potential value of $4.5 billion between 2 awardees for security support services, and a pair of IDIQ contracts with the EPA with a potential value of $380 million to support the agency's environmental and climate initiatives.\nIn fact, GDIT booked the highest orders they've seen since the second quarter of 2019. And their pipeline remains robust with $19 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $84 billion in qualified opportunities identified.\nNow let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments.\n\nPhebe Novakovic\n\nThanks, Jason. Now I may review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace held its own in a very difficult operating environment. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $229 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $11 million less than last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 4 fewer aircraft. The fewer aircraft deliveries were almost completely offset by higher ball stream services, debt aviation volume and special missions work at Gulfstream. The 21 deliveries in the quarter are 3 fewer than planned, two 280s did not deliver because of late engine deliveries. The other plan, a large cabin for an international customer didn't deliver because of simple bureaucratic registration delays in the owner's country.\nImportantly, this is the first quarter in which we have missed an airplane delivery as a result of supply chain issues. Up until now, we have managed to work around late to schedule parts delivery. Operating earnings of $229 million or $14 million behind last year's first quarter as a result of a 70 basis point degradation in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was under pressure as a result of fewer new airplane deliveries, a less attractive mix, severe supply chain issues, some modest cost increases from suppliers and the prebuild of G700. Let's take a look at some of these elements in greater detail.\nThe shortage of parts to schedule from the supply chain, especially from Honeywell has created significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient. We have a young, well trained and capable workforce. They have, however, never previously been exposed out of station work. They are doing well. I am pleased to report, but it had an impact. The other impact of latest scheduled parts deliveries, apart from cost growth is that we cannot increase our build rate until the supply of parts is more predictable. The good news is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We see the vast majority of this problem resolving early in the third quarter, but for 2 large suppliers who will take a little longer to resolve.\nAs most of you know, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. To do that, we must build them now and incur some period costs without the related revenue. This has impacted the first quarter and will impact the second quarter, but relief is in sight as deliveries commence. Aerospace had a decent quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 0.9:1 in dollar terms and 1:1 in units. The quarter was looking quite good until the 2 regional bank failures in early March. This created a pause in the market for about 3 weeks. I am pleased to report that normal activity has resumed. Strong sales activity and customer interest is evident in this quarter. The U.S. has been strong and the Middle East as well. China remains slow. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacture and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of the G700 for late summer this year.\nGulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is well underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.\nLooking forward to the next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircrafts with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarter deliveries, as we have previously indicated. In short, the Aerospace team did a good job under difficult circumstances.\nNext, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.76 billion, up 4.8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $245 million are up 7.9% and margins at 14% represent a 40 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. So we saw a strong operating performance coupled with a nice revenue uptick. At Land Systems, Increased revenue came from the MPF ramp-up, Stryker SHORAD and new international vehicle programs for Poland and Australia. At European Land Systems, we had higher Parana volume and OTS enjoyed higher artillery program volume. So we saw increased revenue performance at each of the businesses.\nHere's a little additional color on Combat Systems revenue results. Foreign exchange fluctuations negatively impacted Combats revenue in the quarter due to the strength of the dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, Combat Systems revenue growth would have been up 7.1% over the last year rather than the 4.8% we have just reported. We also experienced very strong order performance at Combat. Orders in the quarter are at their highest level in more than 8 years, evidencing the strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. There is clear upward pressure on our forecast for Combat Systems revenue and earnings in the year.\nTurning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. As an aside, let me repeat a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter of '19. The first quarter of '21 was up 10.6% over '20 and first quarter 2022 was up 6.8% over '21. Finally, this quarter revenue of almost $3 billion is up 12.9% over 2022. This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. This quarter's growth was led by Columbia class construction and engineering, DDG-51 construction and some T-AO volume. Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, exactly the same as a year ago, but with a 90 basis point decrement in operating margin. The primary driver of lower margins during the quarter was a charge on the Virginia program to reflect cost pressure within our supply chain and efficiency impacts at electric boat as a result of late material deliveries. This was partially offset by Colombia margin improvement.\nOther modest margin impacts included an earnings decline at Bath as a result of a onetime pickup in the year ago quarter and cost inflation reimbursement that does not carry profits. Overall, earnings are what we expected, but revenue was higher, resulting in lower margins. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. I would say, however, that our quarterly progression differs from prior years and that the second quarter will be our lowest quarter because of mix and volume across the business.\nNonetheless, we look forward to very strong third and fourth quarters. We will give you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom. This concludes my remarks with respect to what was a challenging but in many respects, rewarding quarter.\n\nHoward Rubel\n\nThanks, Phebe.

We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.\nWith my introduction complete, I turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Phebe Novakovic.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nCEO & Chairperson, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.58 per diluted share on revenue of $10.850 billion, operating earnings of $1.230 billion and net earnings of $992 million. Revenue is up $559 million or 5.4% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $41 million or 3.5%. Net earnings are up $40 million or 4.2% and earnings per share are up $0.19 to 5.6%.\nSo the quarter-over-quarter results compare very favorably and are in most respects, consistent with our forecast and sell-side consensus. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $876 million or 8.8%; operating earnings by $129 million or 11.7%; net earnings by $90 million or 10%; and EPS by $0.32, a 9.8% improvement. As promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest for the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings per share, operating margins, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $39.4 billion, up 2.4%; net earnings of $3.4 billion, up 4.1%; and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.19, up $0.54, a 5.5% increase. So overall, the year was also reasonably consistent with our forecast and modestly better than the sell side. It was a very solid year in a difficult environment.\nLet me ask Jason to provide detail on our overall order activity, very strong backlog and cash performance in the quarter and the year.\n\nJason W. Aiken\n\nExecutive VP of Technology & CFO, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nYes. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. order activity and backlog were once again a very strong story with a 1.2:1 book-to-bill ratio for the company for the fourth quarter and a 1.1x for the full year. Order activity in the Marine and Aerospace groups led the way. We finished the year with a total backlog at an all-time high of $91.1 billion and total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, of nearly $128 billion. I should note that foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued to be a headwind, reducing year-end backlog by nearly $600 million, with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems.\nTurning to our cash performance for the quarter and the year. It was another solid quarter with operating cash flow of $669 million, which brings us to $4.6 billion of operating cash flow for the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was nearly $3.5 billion, a cash conversion rate of 102%, slightly ahead of our target for the year of 100% of net income. As discussed on previous calls, Gulfstream enjoyed particularly strong cash performance throughout the year on the strength of its order activity and the Technologies Group once again delivered outstanding cash performance.\nThat said, when we talked with you in October, we discussed 3 potential constraints to cash in the fourth quarter. The pending outcome of congressional action on the tax treatment of R&D expenditures, the timing of resumption of cash collections on the Ajax program in the U.K. and an anticipated uptick in capital expenditures as we progress through our ongoing facility investments. As it turns out, the Congress did not act to remedy the requirement to capitalize R&D costs, we did not receive any payments from the U.K., though we now expect payments to resume this quarter, and our capital investments were in fact elevated, consistent with expectations.\nI'll discuss that in more detail a little later in the call. The net result was a lighter fourth quarter from a free cash flow perspective but slightly better than we had expected and rounds out a very strong year in terms of cash performance despite the headwinds I discussed. I should also point out that free cash flow per share has grown at a 22% compound annual growth rate from 2019 through 2022.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nCEO & Chairperson, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segment, paying modest attention to the quarter-over-quarter sequential and annual comparisons that are rather straightforward and set out in the press release.\nFirst, Aerospace. The story in aerospace has found in the sequential and year-over-year improvement as well as a continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, along with the overall strength of Gulfstream service business and the continuing improvement of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings of $337 million. This represents a 4.4% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings on a sequential basis.\nFor the full year, revenue of $8.57 billion is up $432 million from the prior year, even though we delivered only 1 more aircraft than we did in 2021. The increase in both revenue and earnings was driven by higher service revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Earnings were also helped by somewhat higher margins on delivered aircraft. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis aren't as attractive because 3 aircraft we plan to deliver in the fourth quarter slipped into the first quarter this year. Gulfstream had 38 deliveries in the quarter when we had planned to deliver 41.\nAs a result, Aerospace revenue and earnings are somewhat less than anticipated by the sell side for the quarter and for the year, but generally consistent with our forecast. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved consistently quarter-over-quarter throughout the year. Aerospace demand remained strong. The book-to-bill was 1.2x in the quarter and 1.4x at Gulfstream alone. Orders in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The Aerospace book-to-bill for the year was 1.5x.\nTo give you a little more color. Gulfstream received 430 new aircraft orders over the past 2 years, over 400 net orders after defaults and backlog adjustments as a result of the settlement of a case in arbitration. All said and done, Aerospace backlog is up 20% in 2022, and a staggering 68% over the past few years. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. At midyear 2022, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.6 billion and an operating margin of around 12.9%. We actually finished the year with a 13.2% operating margin. In short, we were spot on with respect to revenue and 30 basis points better on operating margin, which led to a $25 million more than forecast in operating earnings.\nWith respect to G700 development, we estimate it will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FFA resources. So far, the effort has been very collaborative and is proceeding according to plan with no surprises.\nIn summary, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and for the year. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2023 at Gulfstream and improved operating margin, but more about that as we get into guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet.\nNext, Combat Systems. After a relatively slow start to the year, Combat Systems finished with a powerful fourth quarter. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2022 proved the highest revenue and earnings for Combat Systems in over 10 years. Revenue in the quarter was $2.18 billion, and it's up 15.5% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $332 million are up 18.1% on a 30 basis point increase in operating margin. OTS alone captured more than 1/3 of its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. The revenue growth was largely driven by Mobile Protected Firepower, Abrams for Poland and the large international order in Canada. OTS enjoyed higher revenue across all lines of business, with particular strength in artillery rounds.\nNot surprising, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $391 million or 21.9%; and earnings are up $61 million or 22.5% on the strength of a 15.2% operating margin. From an orders perspective, Combat had a very good year in 2022 with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, driven by MPS, very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank as well as growing demand on the munition side of the business. By the way, Combat's annual performance is fairly consistent with the forecast we provided you earlier in the year. Revenue and operating earnings are up somewhat and operating margin is a little lower.\nIn short, this group had a wonderful quarter, continued its history of strong margin performance and had good order activity and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward.\nMarine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.970 billion is up 3.4% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was also up 7.2% sequentially and 4.9% for the full year. Operating earnings are up about 1% over the year ago of less than 0.5% sequentially and up 2.6% for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. A little perspective may be of assistance here. Marine Systems has grown revenue from $8 billion in 2017 to $11 billion in 2022, this is a 5.3% compound annual growth rate with an average increase of $600 million per year. Earnings have grown from $685 million in 2017 to $900 million in 2022, a 5.5% compound annual growth rate.\nIn addition, Marine had strong orders in the quarter, generating a 2.2x book-to-bill, including the receipt of a $5.1 billion contract modification to Colombia. Our forecast to you in July of last year anticipated revenue of about $10.8 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $896 million. We came in above that for revenue, a little lower on the predicted operating margin and right on the forecasted earnings.\nSo Jason is going to give you a little color on the Technologies Group, his new responsibility, provide a bit of perspective on balance sheet, other income and expense items, and I will close with our outlook for 2023.\n\nJason W. Aiken\n\nExecutive VP of Technology & CFO, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThe Technologies Group as a whole had a very strong finish to a solid year and a very challenging operating environment. Revenue in the quarter of $3.25 billion was up 9.3% over the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Operating earnings of $340 million were up about 2% over the fourth quarter of 2021; and sequentially were up an impressive 19%. The main driver of the fourth quarter performance was Mission Systems' ability to overcome some of the logjam in its supply chain and deliver some of the product that was held up at the end of the third quarter. While these issues have not been completely resolved, the fourth quarter performance gives us good reason for optimism that they're starting to see their way through this.\nFor the year, revenue of $12.5 billion was up just slightly from 2021. Breaking that down, GDIT once again grew in the low single digits, up 1.6% after 2.2% growth in 2021. Mission Systems was down 2% despite the strong end to the year. Earnings for the year of $1.23 billion were down 3.8% on a 40 basis point contraction in margin to 9.8% as a result of the mix shift between product and service revenue as GDIT reported its highest margin since the CSRA acquisition and its highest ever earnings, but Mission Systems was down for the reasons discussed.\nWith respect to backlog, the Technologies Group had a solid year, notwithstanding an ongoing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. GDIT received over $11 billion in awards during the year, almost 20% higher than 2021, representing more new work than any year since the CSRA acquisition. And Mission Systems finished the year with a 1.1x book-to-bill and a capture rate in excess of 80%, putting them in a good position to emerge from the supply chain headwinds they have been facing.\nWith that, I'll turn to some of the financial particulars before turning it back over to Phebe to give you our guidance for 2023. Starting with capital deployment in 2022, Capital expenditures, as I noted, were elevated in the fourth quarter at $494 million or 4.6% of sales. That brings us to $1.1 billion for the full year. At 2.8% of sales, full year capital expenditures are slightly higher than our original expectation due strictly to timing. We expect capital expenditures to start to step back down below 2.5% in 2023 and continuing to trend towards historic levels. We also paid $345 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.4 billion, and we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to over 5 million shares for the year for $1.2 billion at just under $226 per share.\nWith respect to our pension plans, we contributed $50 million in 2022, and we expect that to increase to approximately $200 million in 2023. This includes a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, which was made this month and fully fund the plan that had a funding gap of more than $500 million within the past 2 years. Concurrently, we shifted the investment mix to hedge the plan's $2 billion of liabilities, thus eliminating any funding risk associated with market volatility or discount rate fluctuations.\nHowever, as a result of the change in investment mix, our pension income will be lower in 2023. Following this derisking activity, we expect our corporate operating expense for 2023 to be approximately $140 million and our other income to be approximately $80 million, a combined reduction of roughly $125 million in nonoperating, noncash income from 2022. Speaking of pension income, the fourth quarter had higher-than-anticipated other income as we benefited from higher discount rates for measuring liabilities on our nonqualified pension plans, which are mark-to-market at the end of the year. We also repaid $1 billion of fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down approximately $600 million from last year.\nWe have $1.25 billion of debt maturing in 2023. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $364 million. That compares to $93 million and $424 million in the respective 2021 period. Pending our decisions with respect to the scheduled debt maturities, we expect interest expense in 2023 to remain essentially consistent with 2022. Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16%, consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings.\nThe sum total of these below-the-line items versus the comparable levels in 2022 is a net negative impact on 2023 diluted earnings per share of $0.63.\nAnd finally, with respect to our outlook for free cash flow, following a strong 2022, we expect cash conversion in 2023 to be better than 100%, roughly in the 105% range, assuming the resumption of Ajax receipts in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier.\nThat concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nCEO & Chairperson, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. So let me provide our operating forecast for 2023 with some color around our outlook for each of the business groups and then a company-wide roll-up.\nIn 2023, we expect Aerospace revenue to be around $10.4 billion up between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Margin is expected to be up 140 basis points to 14.6%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 145, up a little over 20%. This is all consistent with the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of 2021 and at the end of Q2.\nIn Combat systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be down slightly in 2023, following a modest decline in 2022 with a return to low single-digit growth later in our planning horizon. Since then, the threat environment has clearly changed. Continuing the better-than-expected performance in 2022, we expect the group to hold steady again in '23 with revenue of $7.3 billion and operating margin once again towards the high end of their reliable 14% to 15% range at 14.7%. The improved outlook is a result of strong order activity we saw in 2022, including the MPF Award and growing international demand, particularly the tank order in Poland, which came in sooner than had been anticipated. We're seeing demand signals resulting from the war in Ukraine, but we've only just begun to see that manifest in our backlog at this point.\nTo the extent those demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue in the latter part of the year, particularly in our armaments and munition business. As I noted earlier, Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey, averaging $600 million a year. Our outlook of $400 million to $500 million per year over time remains unchanged. However, the supply chain constraints of the Virginia program will drive some annual variability this year. As a result, the group's revenue for 2023 will remain essentially flat at $10.9 billion as well their operating margin rate at 8.1%. We anticipate a return to growth in 2024 and 2025 of around $600 million a year. We expect revenue in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.6 billion in the Technologies Group.\nTo give you a little color behind this outlook, GDIT will continue to grow at a low single-digit pace consistent with the past 2 years. Mission Systems, however, will be challenged from a revenue perspective, particularly in the first half of the year as they work through the lingering supply chain issues they've been dealing with for the past 18 months. As a result, their revenue will be down slightly compared with 2022. The resulting shift in the group's revenue mix, with stronger service activity but lower hardware volume was yield in operating margin in the 9.5% range, sustaining their industry-leading performance, albeit slightly lower than 2022.\nSo for 2023, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $41.2 billion to $41.3 billion of revenue, an increase of almost 5%. We anticipate operating margin of 10.9%, up 20 basis points from 2022. This all rolls up to a forecast range of $12.60 to $12.65 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect a pattern similar to what we've seen in recent years. With sequential increases in revenue and operating margins throughout the year. As always, this forecast is purely from operations. It assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady to avoid dilution from option exercises. Beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effective deployment of capital.\nLet me close with an observation. Our forecast comes from our operating plan. It is conservative as it must be in this environment of unpredictable financing of the government. However, the threat environment suggests increases in defense spending. In short, I see more opportunity than risk in our forecast.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Howard, please go ahead.\n\nHoward Alan Rubel\n\nVP of IR, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call.\nAny forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.\nWith that completed, I turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nCEO & Chairperson, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us.\nEarlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share on revenue of $10 billion, operating earnings of $1.1 billion, and net earnings of $902 million. Revenue is up $407 million or 4.3% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $18 million or 1.7%. Net earnings are up 4.9%, and earnings per share are up 6.2%. So the quarter-over-quarter results compare favorably.\nThe sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by 8.6%, operating earnings by 12.3%, net earnings by 17.8% and EPS by 18.5%. We beat consensus by $0.11 per share on somewhat higher revenue than anticipated by the sell side. Operating margin is about as anticipated. Most of the beat came from various other items, including a lower tax rate than anticipated by the sell side. On a year-to-date basis, net earnings are up $93 million or 4% and earnings per share are up $0.45, a strong 5.5%.\nWe also had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective. Net cash flow provided by operating activities is $1.28 billion. Free cash flow was $1.03 billion, 114% of net income. This follows a very strong cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter across all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream. You will hear more detail on cash and backlog from Jason a little later.\nIn summary, we enjoyed a strong quarter, particularly so in light of supply chain, foreign exchange and inflation headwinds.\nSo let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2.35 billion and operating earnings of $312 million, with a 13.3% operating margin. Revenue is $281 million more than a year ago quarter, up 13.6%. Operating earnings of $50 million more, up 19.1% on higher revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in margins.\nThe sequential improvement is even better. Revenue is up $480 million or 25.7%, and operating earnings are up $74 million or 31.1%. To be fair, the prior quarter's revenue and earnings were somewhat lower as a result of the inability to deliver for aircraft due to the airworthiness directive, which was fully resolved in the third quarter.\nFrom an order perspective, this was yet another good quarter, reflecting continuing strong demand. The Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.15:1. Gulfstream aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 and 1.9:1 year-to-date. To put the point in perspective, since the end of the third quarter of 2021, Aerospace total backlog has grown $4.362 billion, to reach a very robust $19.1 billion.\nDespite apparent macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to experience a strong level of interest, good activity and a replenishing pipeline. Certainly, demand in the quarter was not as superheated as prior quarters, but still the book-to-bill was very good against a significant increase in deliveries. Only time will tell about the macroeconomic impact, but we continue to see strong interest in Gulfstream aircraft and services.\nFrom a product perspective, the G500 and G600 have now seen the FAA removed the wind-related airworthiness directive right on the schedule we had previously forecast. Almost the entire fleet had received the installation of the upgraded software by the end of the quarter. We have delivered 188 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter. The G500, G600 together led the quarter in orders follow closely by G650. This is a very successful program with real market momentum.\nWith respect to G700 development, the control law software validation is scheduled to begin FAA-type inspection authorization during the first week of November. We estimate we will certify this upcoming summer, but much depends on available FAA resources. Gulfstream had 35 deliveries in the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we'll deliver 40 to 41 aircraft in the fourth quarter.\nI haven't said much about Jet Aviation, but suffice it to say, it performed well in the quarter with improving margins in its MRO activities. In short, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and should have an even stronger fourth quarter.\nNext, Combat. Combat Systems had very similar results on a quarter over year ago quarter basis, but with strong improvement sequentially. The Combat Systems revenue of $1.79 billion is up 2.5% from the year ago quarter. Earnings are down 1.8% on a 60 basis point reduction in operating margin. Nevertheless, the operating margin in the quarter is an impressive 15.2%.\nOn a sequential basis, Combat Systems revenue is up $122 million or 7.3%, while operating earnings are up a very significant 10.6% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin. Demand across the segment provided a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 with a large order for Abrams main battle tanks for Poland, orders for $370 million for munitions and ordnance, and an order for 39 LAVs from the Canadian government. We also received our first order related to the Ukraine at our munitions business. All of this increases the Combat Systems total backlog to $13.8 billion.\nIn summary, this was an impressive new business quarter with strong operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group.\nNext, Marine. Revenue of $2.8 billion is up $132 million, 5% over the year ago quarter. This quarter's revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly between Electric Boat and NASSCO. Revenue is also up $118 million or 4.5% sequentially. Year-to-date revenue is up $415 million or 5.4%. Revenue in this group has been up for the last 20 quarters on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This is very impressive continued consistent growth.\nOperating earnings are $238 million in the quarter, up $9 million or 3.9% on operating margins of 8.6%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are $27 million or an impressive 12.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. At Electric Boat, the Columbia first ship remains on cost and on contract schedule. The ship is more than 25% complete. NASSCO had a particularly good quarter with improved [T-AO] revenue and better margins across the board.\nFrom an orders perspective, Electric Boat received a large maintenance and modernization order for the USS Hartford. NASSCO received orders for an additional ESB and 2 T-AO Oilers. As a result, book-to-bill was 1.1:1, leading to a $400 million increase in backlog. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work. Our programs are also well supported in the FY '23 budget.\nIn summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. And as I've said before, the real opportunity given the steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time.\nMoving to Technologies. This segment has revenue of $3.71 billion in the quarter, down $49 million from the year ago quarter or 1.6%. The revenue decrease was fairly evenly split in dollar terms between Mission Systems and IT. Mission Systems suffered from nagging supply chain disruptions and the failure of some government customers to obligate funds for authorized and appropriated products. In the case of IT services, it was largely timing and program mix.\nOperating earnings of $285 million are down $42 million or 12.8% on a 120 basis point reduction in operating margin, exclusively attributed to Mission Systems and largely related to the issues impacting revenue. Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparative periods with a book-to-bill of 1:1 in good order prospects on the horizon. The pipeline remains very active at both businesses. GDIT enjoyed another solid operating quarter with healthy earnings and particularly strong cash in part due to good results in the federal civilian division.\nWhile we continue to see procurement delays, GDIT's year-to-date wins exceeded full year 2021 awards in dollar terms. These wins highlight the nice momentum in the business as GDIT begins to realize the benefits from targeted investments in the technical differentiation of its offerings. And this, despite the more than $3.5 billion tied up in prolonged protest and nearly $17 billion pending adjudication at the end of the third quarter.\nOn the people front, GDIT remains focused on attracting and retaining the very best technology talent. The culture this business has created, one of empowerment, accountability and inclusivity, is a clear differentiator and a fiercely competitive talent market.\nMission Systems experienced a series of challenges in the third quarter, additional supply chain disruptions, inflation, labor availability and select intel programs and customer contracting delays. Many Mission Systems customers have a serious shortage of contracting officers that have hampered their ability to execute on programs of record. In addition, quite understandably, customer focus has been redirected in some areas to meet the more urgent demands of the Ukraine.\nThe business has offset some of the bottom line impact by productivity improvements and cost-cutting initiatives. They will make every effort to catch up in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, we anticipate these fact of life realities to continue for a while. I'll have more to say on that subject in a moment.\nThat concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter for the entire company. So as we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be largely in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call. As I just referenced, we expect Technologies to fall short of our previous estimates, but we expect Aerospace to run somewhat ahead of our previous forecast. All up, they should offset each other. In all other respects, our guidance remains the same. We stand by our previous EPS guidance.\nI'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks.\n\nJason W. Aiken\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. Starting with our cash performance. It was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream orders and particularly strong cash performance from our Technologies segment. This brings us to $3.9 billion of operating cash flow through the first 9 months of the year, which also includes the ongoing collections on our large international combat vehicle contract according to the contract restructure that occurred back in 2020.\nIncluding capital expenditures, our free cash flow was just over $1 billion for the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 137% through the first 9 months. The continued strong performance positions us very well to achieve our target for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income.\nWith respect to the status of the tax treatment of research and development expenses, I think everyone can sense that despite the broad-based bipartisan support for immediate expensing of these investments, the window of opportunity for action in 2022 is quickly closing. As we've said all throughout the year, if the Congress acts to defer or reverse the capitalization requirement, we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income.\nLooking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $255 million in the quarter or 2.6% of sales. That's up from last year, consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first 9 months, we're at 2.2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target, so obviously an implied uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter.\nWe also paid $345 million in dividends during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first 9 months to just over $2.1 billion. The net result at the end of the third quarter was a cash balance of $2.5 billion and a net debt position just under $9 billion, down over $1.5 billion from this time last year.\nNet interest expense in the quarter was $86 million, down from $99 million in the third quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $279 million, down from $331 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter.\nThe tax rate in the quarter was 14.3%, bringing the rate for the first 9 months to 15.1%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year, which, of course, implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter. One more comment on the tax front. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August, included a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. We don't expect either of these provisions to have a material impact on our financial results.\nOrder activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As mentioned earlier, Aerospace continued to have a strong order activity with a 1.2x book-to-bill in the quarter and 1.6x over the trailing 12 months.\nOn the defense side, the combined book-to-bill was 1.1x, with each of the segments achieving a book-to-bill of at least 1x. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.8 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $125.8 billion. The increase in backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $275 million in the quarter and $650 million year-to-date, with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems.\nIncidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combats revenue by $55 million in the quarter and $123 million in the first 9 months of the year due to the surging dollar versus the euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, the Combat Systems group's revenue would have been up by 5.6% in the quarter and down only 3.9% for the first 9 months.\nThat concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A.",

My name is Brika, and I will be your event specialist today. (Operator Instructions)\nI now have the pleasure of handing the call over to our host, Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. So Howard, please go ahead.\n\nHoward Alan Rubel\n\nVP of IR, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.\nWe will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.\nWith that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.\n\nJason W. Aiken\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Before we get started, I want to let you all know that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic, isn't able to join us this morning. She recently came down with COVID, but not to worry, she's on the mend and doing well, but she's asked me to cover today's call.\nWith me is Bill Moss, our Vice President and Corporate Controller, who will cover some of the financial particulars that I would normally address. So with that, let's get into the results.\nEarlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.75 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $978 million, earnings before taxes of $923 million and net income of $766 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings were up $19 million. Earnings before taxes were up $42 million, and net earnings were up $29 million. Earnings per share were up $0.14, a 5.4% increase. To be a little more granular, we enjoyed revenue increases at Aerospace and Marine Systems, offset by declines at Combat Systems and technologies. We also had margin improvement in 3 of the 4 segments, which led to higher operating earnings and earnings before taxes against the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.03 per share on somewhat lower revenue, but somewhat higher operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. This led to the modest earnings beat.\nOn a year-to-date basis, revenue for all practical purposes, was even with last year's first half. Similarly, operating earnings were essentially flat, but earnings before taxes were up $46 million, net earnings were up $51 million, and EPS was up $0.25, almost 5%. In the quarter, free cash flow of $435 million was 57% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 86% of net income. This was pretty good in light of the powerful first quarter cash. To that point, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.3 billion was 151% of net earnings. In summary, we had a solid quarter from an earnings perspective, and the year-to-date results give us a solid start to the year.\nSo let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Bill add color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash, and then I'll provide updated guidance. I'll try to keep my remarks brief to leave ample opportunity for questions.\nFirst, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.9 billion, operating earnings of $238 million and a 12.7% operating margin. Revenue was $245 million more than the year ago quarter or 15.1%, largely as a result of higher service center sales at Gulfstream and higher service volume, particularly FBOs at Jet Aviation. Operating earnings are up $43 million or 22.1% on a 70 basis point improvement in margins. So increased sales volume, coupled with improved margins, leads to very good operating leverage.\nWe captured improved revenue on only 22 deliveries. We didn't deliver 4 G500 and 600s that were scheduled to deliver in the quarter. They've been deferred at customer request to the third quarter, awaiting removal of the FAA wind directive. However, 9 G500s and 600s, in fact, were delivered to customers in the quarter. So we delivered 9 of the 13 that were planned in the quarter.\nFrom an order perspective, we did very well once again. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 2:1. Gulfstream aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 2.7:1, even stronger if expressed in unit terms. As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February 2021 and continued on to the second quarter of this year. The pipeline and sales activity remained strong as we enter this quarter. The Farnborough Air Show was a good one for us.\nFrom a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continue to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis, and quality is superb. We're making good progress in the flight test of the software update for landing and high winds and expect removal of the FAA directive in mid-September. You may recall that last quarter, we advised you of a risk of a 3- to 6-month delay for certification of the G700 to second quarter 2023 as a result of the time-consuming work on model-based software validation. As a result of the flight sciences engineering resources we needed to redeploy onto the work related to the G500 and 600 FAA limitation on landings and high wind conditions, the risk to the G700 schedule has become a reality. As we've previously advised, this will not adversely impact our financial plan for 2022 and 2023. We feel confident that the G800 will follow the G700 by about 6 months. Looking forward, we've planned 123 deliveries for the year, and we fully expect to do just that.\nTurning to Defense, Combat Systems had revenue of $1.7 billion, down 12.3% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was impacted by AJAX at both Land Systems and ELS, bomb bodies at OTS and some program mix. Operating earnings of $245 million were off against last year's quarter by 7.9%, with a 70 basis point improvement in margins. Operating margin was a strong 14.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was very similar to the first quarter, but operating earnings were up 7.9% or $18 million on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, Combat Systems revenue was down 10.2%, and operating earnings were down only 7.5% on a 40 basis point improvement in margins.\nIn June, Land Systems was awarded the Mobile Protected Firepower contract, the first all-new combat vehicle for the army in decades. The initial award for LRIP 1 was $410 million for 25 vehicles. The program of record for LRIP is $1.1 billion for 95 vehicles through 2026. The entire program requirement is 500 vehicles for more than $5 billion. The program filled a critical gap in the Army's infantry brigade combat force, and we expect to move out swiftly on the program.\nThe quarter was very good for Combat Systems from an orders perspective with a 1.4:1 book-to-bill, leading to an increase in total backlog and estimated potential contract value. Demand for our products, particularly our combat vehicles, remained strong with Europe leading the way. International order opportunities for Abrams are particularly strong. This was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group in a constrained revenue environment.\nAt Marine Systems, revenue of $2.65 billion was up $115 million over the year ago quarter. It was flat sequentially but up year-to-date. In the quarter, growth was led by Columbia, TAO and repair work volume. For the first half, revenue was up $283 million or 5.6%. This is very impressive continued growth. Operating earnings were $211 million in the quarter, essentially flat with the year ago quarter as a result of a 30 basis point reduction in margin. The margin compression was the result of the impact on Electric Boat of additional scheduled delays in the Virginia program from the supply chain as it struggles with recovering from COVID.\nEB is working closely with the Navy and suppliers, including embedding operating and engineering personnel on-site to restore the necessary Virginia program cadence. Nonetheless, Electric Boat's performance remained strong, and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule. Total backlog of almost $42 billion remains robust and is by far the largest of our operating groups.\nAnd lastly, Technologies. The segment had revenue of $3 billion in the quarter, down $158 million from the year ago quarter or 5%. 2/3 of the decline was attributed to Mission Systems, largely related to their continuing struggle with a shortage of chips which continues to plague their ability to deliver certain products. On the other hand, operating earnings of $304 million were down only $4 million or 1.3% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin to 10.1%. EBITDA margin was an impressive 14.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Operating performance at GDIT was particularly strong, 140 basis points better than the year ago quarter. These are industry-leading margin figures.\nTechnologies had a good order activity in the quarter with book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon. Mission Systems had nice orders for many of their product offerings, especially those impacted by the chip shortage. The IT pipeline remains healthy in most of our federal IT lines of business as the government continues to modernize and upgrade its mission support systems. GDIT has the opportunity to submit $35 billion in opportunities this year, including $17 billion in the third quarter, most of which represents new work.\nThat concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter and first half. I'll now turn the call over to Bill for further remarks, and then I'll provide our updated guidance.\n\nWilliam A. Moss\n\nVP & Controller, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning. Starting with cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $650 million, which following our strong first quarter performance brings us to over $2.6 billion for the first 6 months of the year. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international combat vehicle contract, which continues to receive payments as scheduled according to the contract restructure that occurred in 2020.\nIncluding capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 151% year-to-date. The strong performance so far reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. And of course, as a reminder, that outlook assumes current law with respect to the tax treatment of research and development expenditures. If the Congress acts to defer or reverse the current capitalization requirement, we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income.\nLooking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $224 million in the quarter or 2.4% of sales. That's up from last year, consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first 6 months, we're closer to 2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target. We also paid $349 million in dividends and spent approximately $800 million on the repurchase of 3.6 million shares. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 4.9 million shares for just shy of $1.1 billion.\nThe net result at the end of the second quarter was a cash balance of $2.2 billion and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down more than $2 billion from this time last year. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $95 million, down from $109 million in the second quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $193 million, down from $232 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter.\nThe tax rate in the quarter was 17%, bringing the rate for the first half to 15.6%, so no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But of course, that implies a rate in the mid-16% range for the second half of the year to arrive at that outcome. To shape that for you, we expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth.\nOrder activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the second quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Jason mentioned, order activity in Aerospace led the way with a 2x book-to-bill, which is the fifth consecutive quarter the book-to-bill for the group has been 1.6x or higher. As a result, Aerospace backlog is up over $5 billion in the past year, an increase of almost 40%. During the quarter, we finalized negotiations on the restructure of the last of our arrangements with a fractional aircraft operator, which resulted in a roughly $300 million reduction in the Aerospace backlog and a $900 million reduction in aircraft options. This action essentially clears our backlog of any exposure to fractional customers and has no impact on our production and revenue forecast for 2022 and beyond.\nOn the Defense side, Combat Systems and Technologies also had solid quarters with a 1.4x and a 1x book-to-bill, respectively. The increase in the Combat Systems backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of over $200 million in the quarter and $300 million year-to-date. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combat's revenue by $65 million in the first half of the year as the euro fell to near parity with the dollar. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $126 billion.\nThat concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Jason to give you an update on our guidance for 2022 and wrap-up remarks.\n\nJason W. Aiken\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThanks, Bill. Let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won't repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to this that will be posted on our website, which should be helpful.\nIn Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.9%, which is 10 basis points higher than we previously forecast. This will result in additional operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can deliver out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems should be on the low end of our revenue range with an improvement of up to 50 basis points of operating margin, so total revenue of around $7.1 billion and operating margin around 15%. There's no change to Marine Systems revenue, but 30 basis points lower margin, so annual revenue of $10.8 billion with an operating margin around 8.3% for the reasons I have previously described to you. Technologies revenue will be in the middle of the forecast revenue range at the same operating margin driven by GDIT with 3.5% year-over-year growth.\nSo for the group, we expect annual revenue of around $12.9 billion with an operating margin around 10%. So on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue at the higher end of our initial guidance and an overall operating margin around 10.8%, which is unchanged. This rolls up to EPS at the high end of our previous guidance range. In short, we expect only modest deviation from our initial guidance.\nThat concludes my remarks, and we'll be pleased to take your questions.\n\nHoward Alan Rubel\n\nVP of IR, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Jason. (Operator Instructions) Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?",

My name is Alex, and I'll be coordinating the call today. (Operator Instructions). I will now hand over to your host, Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations for General Dynamics. Over to you, Howard.\n\nHoward Alan Rubel\n\nVP of IR, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook.

With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nCEO & Chairperson, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $908 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is flat against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are down $30 million, but net earnings are up $22 million in line which distorts the truly strong performance of the operating units. The improvement in net earnings was aided by less interest expense and a lower provision for income taxes against the year ago quarter. Earnings per diluted share are up $0.13 or 5.2% year-over-year.\nThe operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, 30 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was as anticipated in our earlier guidance to you, but also shaped by the aforementioned expense at the corporate other line. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.10 per share. We have roughly $400 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $20 million more in operating earnings. We also beat our own expectations, particularly so in aerospace, about which I will have more to say shortly.\nAs we indicated in our press release, cash from operating activities is just shy of $2 billion and about 270% of net income. After capital expenditures, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, 250% of net income. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here.\nThis is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. This is, in important respects, a very strong quarter, a good foundation for the year.\nSo let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around the spectacular cash performance, backlog, taxes, deployment of cash and the makeup of the corporate other line then we'll answer your questions.\nFirst, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed another strong quarter. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $243 million with a 12.8% operating margin. Revenue was $16 million ahead of last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 3 fewer aircraft. Revenue was almost $180 million higher than anticipated by the sell side. The difference is almost entirely growth at Gulfstream Services and Jet Aviation.\nOperating earnings of $243 million or $23 million ahead of last year's first quarter, a 10.5% increase and well ahead of sell-side expectations. The 12.8% operating margin is 110 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. Here, the gross margin on delivered aircraft was slightly better, particularly the 500, but fully offset by increased R&D spending. The improvement comes from higher service revenue, coupled with significantly better margin on net revenue.\nOn the Gulfstream side of the service business, it was the result of an extremely attractive business mix. For Jet Aviation, it was strong performance at the FBOs in the United States. Aerospace also had another very strong quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. Gulfstream aircraft orders alone had a book-to-bill of 2.1:1. The order activity at Gulfstream was strong across the board, but driven by orders for the 650.\nStrong sales activity and customer interest continues so far this quarter as well. The U.S. market remains robust with some slight improvement in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. China remains slow. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has stopped activity in Eastern Europe and slowed activity in Western Europe. All of this, however, is trumped by the strength of the U.S. market.\nI should add that flight activity is increasing in Western Europe, including flights to the U.S. This is a good leading indicator of an improving market in Western Europe.\nOn the new product front, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a steady basis and quality is superb. As of the end of the quarter, Gulfstream has over 160 of these aircraft in service, will support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat.\nTurning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter in '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. In first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia class construction and repair volume.\nWe also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards.\nOperating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups.\nFinally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and a stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years.\nOperating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially. Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result.\nTotal backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for Technologies was 1.1:1, led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of this quarter's awards represented new business.\nThe G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. We have 5 flight test aircraft that have completed over 2,800 flight hours. We also have conducted over 25,000 hours of laboratory simulated flying. All structural testing is complete and all structural requirements have been met. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature.\nThe new Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 designed specifically to match the G700 aerodynamic to optimize speed, range, emission and fuel burn will be certified in the next few months. The engine is performing well and exceeding key performance parameters. Our final step toward entry into service is to complete certification flying with the FAA. This is typically the most predictable part of our test program.\nAll of this has been achieved during a pandemic and a certification process made increasingly rigorous due to industry events unrelated to Gulfstream. In that connection, this flight test process has a first-time requirement that was not part of our original flight test plan or any prior development effort. It is a model-based developmental software validation, a line-by-line examination of the plane software. The level of effort is considerable, completing 100% of the software validation is the impediment to finishing performance testing by the FAA and G800 first flight. I can assure you that the validation work to date has proceeded well and presented no surprises. It is just resource and time intensive. This leads me to some comments on the timing of certification.\nWe continue to target certification of the G700 for the fourth quarter of this year, but the ultimate timing is dependent on the FAA. It seems prudent for us at this time to recognize the risk of a 3- to 6-month slip in the process and to plan for it accordingly. If such a slip were to occur, we have offset any impact to our 2022 financial plan with an increase of deliveries of current production aircraft. This would also not adversely impact 2023. It also remains our view that the G800 certification will follow the G700 by 6 to 9 months.\nGulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.\nLooking forward to next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircraft with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarters as we have previously indicated. So far, supply chain issues have been in the news in this category. However, we expect an increasing number of issues in this regard later in the year and believe we are on a path to work through them successfully. In short, off to a very good start at Aerospace.\nNext, Combat. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.68 billion, down 8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $227 million are down 7%. The numbers are reasonably consistent with our outlook and sell-side expectations. Margins at 13.6% are a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter, so strong operating performance.\nStryker and Abrams have considerable support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat.\nTurning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. And first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia-class construction and repair volume. We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards.\nOperating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups.\nFinally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and the stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years. Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially.\nTechnologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for technology is 1.1:1 led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of the quarter's awards represented new business.\nSo good order activity in the quarter and good order prospects on the horizon. GDIT alone submitted over $5 billion in the quarter, bringing the number of submitted proposals in the decision or protest queue to $29 billion. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. We will, however, provide you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom.\nThis concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks and then we'll take your questions.\n\nJason W. Aiken\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is the unusually high corporate operating expense of $71 million in the quarter, which is up from $32 million in the year ago quarter.\nGiven our full year expectation of around $110 million in corporate expense this year, you might have expected a first quarter number similar to last year. However, this year was impacted by a change to some of the terms of our equity compensation plan, which resulted in the acceleration of the expense associated with those awards. This was a onetime noncash item, and you should expect a lower corporate expense in the remaining quarters to result in our full year outlook of $110 million.\nIf you consider the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, excluding this corporate expense anomaly, the segment margins improved from 10.3% a year ago to 10.4% this quarter.\nTurning to our cash performance. We had the strongest first quarter we've seen in some time. Following several years of negative free cash flow in the first quarter, this quarter was a marked improvement due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international vehicle program at Combat Systems.\nFor the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $2 billion for a conversion rate of 270% of net income. Including capital expenditures of $141 million, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion or a conversion rate of 250%. So the quarter was well ahead of our expectations, some of which was favorable timing in our operating working capital, but the performance certainly reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income.\nLooking at capital deployment, I mentioned capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter or 1.5% of sales, which is consistent with last year. We're still planning for CapEx to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. We also paid $330 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend nearly 6% to $1.26 per share. And we spent over $290 million on the repurchase of $1.3 million of our shares at an average price of almost $225 per share.\nAfter all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion and a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down $2.8 billion from this time last year and about $1.3 billion below the year-end position.\nNet interest expense in the quarter was $98 million, down from $123 million in the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in 2022 is due to the $1.5 billion reduction in debt last year. We have another $1 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we'll have more to say about our plans related to those notes as we get closer to their maturity in November.\nThe tax rate in the quarter at 14% benefited from the timing of equity compensation activity and associated deductions, consistent with our expectations. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But, of course, that implies a higher rate for the balance of the year to arrive at that outcome.\nOrder activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill, which is also the book-to-bill for the group over the last 12 months. As a result, aerospace backlog has increased by almost 50% in the past year.\nTechnologies and Combat Systems also had solid quarters with a 1.1x and a 1x book-to-bill, respectively. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.2 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129 billion.\nFinally, a quick note on our expectations for EPS progression for the balance of the year. We expect the second quarter to be roughly $0.10 above the first quarter with more significant steps up in the second half of the year.\nHoward, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.\n\nHoward Alan Rubel\n\nVP of IR, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Alan Rubel\n\nVP of IR, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call.\nAny forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page on our website, investorrelations.gd.com.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nCEO & Chairperson, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion, net earnings of $952 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.39. This is, in most respects, consistent with our previous guidance and sell-side consensus. The results in comparison with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. I'll go through some of that detail quite briefly as I give you my thoughts on the business segments.\nAs we indicated it would be, the final quarter is our strongest quarter of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings, operating margin, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the prior quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement.\nOn a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue is up $724 million, operating earnings are up $106 million and earnings per share are up $0.32. So all in all, a solid quarter with good operating performance.\nFor the full year, we had revenue of $38.5 billion, up 1.4% from 2020; net earnings of $3.26 billion, up 2.8%; and earnings per fully diluted share of $11.55, modestly better than consensus and up $0.55 over 2020. We ended the year with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value of $127.5 billion. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in Aerospace backlog to $16.3 billion. I'll have more to say about that when we get to the business segment comments.\nThe total company book-to-bill was 1:1 for the quarter and the year, led by the powerful order performance of Gulfstream. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year is very strong. The conversion rates for the quarter is 136% of net income and 104% for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject and backlog in his remarks.\nNow let me turn to reviewing the quarter and paying some attention to quarter-over-quarter and sequential comparisons as well as the full year in the context of each group and provide color as appropriate.\nSo first, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.6 billion is up 5.1% over the year-ago quarter on the delivery of 39 aircraft, 35 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectation by 1 aircraft, which has slipped into 2022. For the full year, revenue of $8.14 billion is up modestly from the prior year, even though we delivered 119 aircraft, 8 fewer aircraft than we did in 2020. The increase was driven by higher service revenue at Gulfstream and a nice increase in revenue at Jet Aviation.\nFourth quarter Aerospace earnings of $354 million are down $47 million from a year-ago quarter even though revenue was $125 million higher, resulting in a 270 basis point reduction in operating margin. The major source of the variance is a $50 million increase in net R&D costs driven by the certification on the G700 and G800 and accelerated work on the G400. The year-ago quarter was also helped by a significant launch assistant payment that was an offset to gross R&D. Nevertheless, Aerospace operating earnings and margins are better than anticipated by consensus, the same can be said for the full year result.\nI should also point out that Aerospace margins improved throughout the year, and that was true with respect to both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. At midyear last year, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.2 billion, operating margin around 12.4% with earnings of $1.01 billion. We finished the year with revenue of $8.14 billion, operating earnings of $1.03 billion and a 12.7% operating margin. In sum, we were slightly better on earnings and margin, but very close to our forecast on revenue.\nFar and away, the most important story in the quarter for Aerospace and frankly, for the company was the extraordinary order activity at Gulfstream. Last quarter, I told you that orders in the third quarter boarded on the spectacular. This quarter, they were significantly better.\nOrder activity in the quarter was beyond anything we had seen since 2008 with the introduction of the G650. Demand had turned very good in mid-February and continued through the second and third quarters, was red hot on fourth quarter. Let me give you the particulars.\nThe Aerospace group in dollar-denominated orders had a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. Gulfstream alone was 1.8: 1. In unit terms, it was over 2x. Remember that these multiples are off of an increased denominator with 39 deliveries. This translates into very significant backlog growth. Aerospace added $1.6 billion to backlog in the quarter and $4.7 billion for the year.\nAs we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains robust and sales activity is brisk. The buildup in backlog and the pace of current demand leaves us with a rich problem, but a problem nonetheless. How do we satisfy the demand manifest in our current backlog supplemented by continuing brisk activity having previously turned down production? Can the supply chain support us? Are we ready?\nWell, the answer is we will increase production in 2022, but not to where it needs to be. Remember also that some of our increased production in '22 will be in building G700 and G800s that will not deliver in '22, a prebuild, if you will. As it turns out, the long pull in the 10 is manufacturing wings, which we do ourselves. You may recall that we previously vertically integrated wing supply because the (inaudible) in the supply chain.\nSo what do we need to do? We need to expand our new modern wing facility and acquire another set of tools and fixtures. All of this is underway and will be in place to satisfy our needs for '23 and beyond.\nThis leads to the question of what are the implications of this for 2022 guidance. I'll address '22 guidance a little later. Further, given the robust and enduring backlog at Gulfstream, we also feel comfortable with giving you a look at what is anticipated for '23 and '24 as well.\nFinally, on the new product development front, all 5 G700 flight test aircraft are flying and have over 2,200 flight test hours. We have completed over 65% of all required testing.\nNext, Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $1.89 billion is off 3.7% from the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $281 million are off $28 million on a 90 basis point decrease in operating margin. Let me point out, however, that a 14.9% margin in the quarter is highly respectable. For the full year, revenue of $7.35 billion is up $128 million, a 1.8% increase after strong growth in 2019 and moderate growth in 2020. Operating earnings for the year of $1.07 billion are up $26 million, a 2.5% increase.\nBy the way, this performance is in line with the guidance we provided earlier in the year. As we look forward for the next few years, we believe that Combat volume will soften somewhat in the increasingly constrained budget environment faced by the U.S. Army. While our platform programs remain critical to the Army War fight, we may see some contraction, in part offset by international growth in Abrams and wheel combat vehicles. We will continue to drive margins as we always have.\nRemember that Combat Systems has had very good margins and much more constrained revenue environments. In short, this group has had a positive revenue growth for several years now, continued its history of strong margin performance, has good order activity and has a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward.\nNext, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems' growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was up less than 1% over the year-ago quarter. However, revenue is up 8.8% sequentially and 5.5% for the full year. Similarly, operating earnings are down somewhat in the quarter, but up sequentially and for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group.\nIn our initial guidance to you, we anticipated revenue of about $10.3 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $855 million. We came in above that for both revenue and earnings and spot on the predicted operating margin.\nOur shipyards have continued to perform well, overcoming most of the challenges that COVID lay in our past. First, continuing to operate without ceasing throughout COVID and more recently, managing labor shortages, part shortages, supply chain disruptions and increasing commodity prices. Importantly, on the latter point, our long-term shipbuilding contracts provide protection from material escalation.\nI'm happy to report that we are working very well with the Bath unions and workforce. And together, we have worked to put the past behind us and concentrate on improving schedule and performance. As a result, that has begun to see improvement on both scores. In response to significant increased demand from our Navy customer that you'll see in these results, we continue to invest in each of our yards, particularly at EB to prepare for Virginia Block V and the Columbia ballistic missile submarine. Suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customer as they increase the size of the fleet and deliver value to our shareholders as we work through this very large backlog.\nFinally, the Technologies group, which consists of GDIT and Mission Systems. Just to remind you, this is the group in the Defense segment that had, had the most impact from COVID-19, with the most remote participation from employees and the most difficulty accessing customer locations whose employees also have been working remotely. It is also where we have the most impact from the short supply of chips and other key components of Mission Systems.\nWith that said, let's turn to the results and commentary on the group and the specific businesses. For the quarter, Technologies had revenue of $2.98 billion, off 7.9% from the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings, however, of $334 million are off only 5.1% on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. The operating margin of 11.2% is the strongest since the formation of this group. Revenue for the full year at $12.46 billion is off 1.5%, but earnings are up $64 million or 5.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. All considered, the group performance showed good strengths and earnings are in line with guidance from us.\nRevenue came in at $543 million below our guidance, driven by Mission System challenges that we have discussed last quarter, offset in part by a 2.2% growth at GDIT. Margins at both companies were very good, enabling us to meet our earnings forecast. So very good operating leverage in a very challenging environment.\nThe group enjoyed a nice order quarter with significant wins and a book-to-bill of 1:1, a little bit stronger at GDIT and a little bit lower at Mission Systems. Mission Systems did a very good job overcoming many of their supply chain challenges and working hard to satisfy the pent-up demand that was driven by a significant backup of work orders in some customer sites and by supply chain shortages.\nTurning to IT. Our Fed and civilian division had a particularly strong year in '21 and helped drive a 60 basis point improvement in margin over 2020. And as has been the case since the acquisition, GDIT's cash performance was outstanding, well in excess of 100% of their imputed net income. GDIT's backlog at the end of 2021 was $8.7 billion, 4% higher than year-end 2020. Book-to-bill was 1.1:1 on sales growth of 2.2%. This is notable in light of the dollar value of GDIT wins and snared and protests that went from about $800 million at the end of 2020 to a whopping $6 billion at the end of '21. While we expect these protests will resolve in our favor, protest resolution timing is outside our control.\nAs we look into '22 we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities to pursue as customers focus on digital modernization and over $32 billion of bids, largely all new work, awaiting customer decisions. So all in all, we expect a good year for the business.\nLet me turn the call over now to Jason Aiken, our CFO, for additional commentary and then return with our guidance for next year. Jason?\n\nJason W. Aiken\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThank you, Phebe, and good morning.\nThe first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter or 136% of net income, with strong cash performance across all 4 segments. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $3.4 billion, a cash conversion rate of 104%. That was nicely ahead of our anticipated 95% to 100% of net income and again, reflective of solid performance across the company, but in particular, the strong order activity at Gulfstream.\nThat strong performance enabled us to continue our balanced and robust capital deployment activities. To that point, capital expenditures were $385 million in the quarter or 3.7% of sales. That's up more than 10% from the prior year and brings us to $887 million for the full year. Of course, Marine Systems continues to drive the elevated CapEx with facilities investments in support of the unprecedented growth the group is experiencing now and for the next decade plus.\nThe full year total for capital investments at 2.3% of sales is slightly below our original expectation of 2.5%. That's due strictly to the timing of the phasing of those projects. While our investments to support the Navy Submarine Programs have peaked, we expect capital expenditures to remain somewhat elevated at about 2.5% of sales in 2022, slightly higher than 2021 before returning, as we forecast for some time, to our more typical 2% range in 2023 and beyond.\nWe also paid $332 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.3 billion. And we repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to just over 10 million shares for the year for $1.8 billion at just under $179 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $135 million in 2021, and we expect that to decrease to approximately $40 million in 2022 as a result of the ARPA funding release.\nAs we've discussed for some time, we expect to continue to generate cash in the 100-plus percent conversion range in 2022 and beyond. Our outlook assumes the unfavorable impact of the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures for tax purposes beginning in 2022 as called for under current law. There's proposed legislation to delay the effective date of this requirement, but we'll have to wait and see if it's approved by Congress and signed into law. Assuming there is a deferral of the R&D capitalization provision, we would expect our free cash flow to be in the 110% conversion range.\nWe ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no commercial paper outstanding, leaving us with a net debt position of $9.9 billion, down approximately $300 million from last year and the first time we've ended the year with net debt below $10 billion since 2018. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $93 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $424 million. That compares to $120 million and $477 million in the respective 2020 periods.\nThe year-over-year reduction in interest expense is due to the retirement of $1.5 billion of long-term debt back in May. Our next scheduled debt maturity is $1 billion in the fourth quarter of this year. And based on the declining net debt balance, we expect interest expense to drop to approximately $380 million in 2022.\nTurning to income taxes. We had a 15.9% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for the full year, consistent with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect the full year effective tax rate to remain around 16%. The rate for 2022 is not impacted by the R&D matter I discussed earlier because that legislation impacts cash taxes, not the effective tax rate. The 2022 rate also assumes there's no other enacted legislation impacting corporate tax rates.\nFrom a quarterly phasing perspective, we expect the first quarter rate to be lower due to the timing of certain tax items, so the rate for the remainder of the year will naturally be higher given the full year forecast.\nOrder activity and backlog were once again a strong story with a 1:1 ratio for the company in the fourth quarter and for the full year. As Phebe mentioned, order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill in the quarter and 1.6x for the full year. As a result, the group's backlog was up 40% in the past year.\nTechnologies recorded a book-to-bill of 1:1 and within that group, GDIT was 1.1x. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts of over $127 billion.\nThat concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2022 and wrap-up remarks.\n\nPhebe N. Novakovic\n\nCEO & Chairperson, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. And with that, I'll turn to our expectations for 2022.\nSo let me provide our operating forecast for '22 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace, we expect 2022 revenue to be around $8.4 billion, up around 4% over 2021, with about 123 deliveries, up from 119 last year. Operating margin will be around 12.8%.\nSo a little color here about what is driving this forecast. While anticipated deliveries are up only 4 units from '21, production of completed aircraft is considerably more than in 2021. Last year, we produced fewer than 119 aircraft that were delivered. We delivered a number of test aircraft that were either produced and completed in prior periods as well as a few demonstrators all up about 11 aircraft. In 2022 production, we are building some G700s and G800 test articles that will not deliver this year. Finally, our ability to ramp up further in '22 is limited by the wing supply issue I described earlier, which will be remedied for '23.\nThis leads me to a quick look at '23 and '24. In 2023, we expect to deliver 148 airplanes, 25 more than in 2022 and have revenue of approximately $2 billion more than '22, with margin improvement around 200 basis points. In '24, we expect to deliver around 170 airplanes, up another 22 driving another $1.6 billion of revenue over '23 and another 100 basis points of margin growth. So all up, over that 2-year near-term time frame, we expect to see $3.6 billion of revenue growth over '22 and 300 basis points of higher operating margins.\nMind you, none of this is supported by heroic assumptions about continuing demand. We assume a book-to-bill of around 1:1 during the period, a notable reduction from this year's demand. If demand is greater, it will impact favorably '24 and '25. In short, we fully expect Aerospace to be a significant growth engine for both revenue and earnings in 2023 and 2024.\nIn Combat Systems, we expect revenue in the range of $7.15 billion to $7.25 billion, a modest reduction against '21 million. We expect operating margin to be about the same at 14.5%. Growth should resume later in our planned period as developmental programs move into production and several anticipated international orders should be received.\nThe Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.8 billion, a $300 million increase over '21. Operating margin in '22 is anticipated to improve to around 8.6%. The long-term driver of growth here is submarine work which will expand as the supply chain improves its efficiency and delivers modules to the grant and waterfront in a more timely fashion. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to increase margins in the period.\nWe expect revenue in Technologies in the range of $12.8 billion to $13 billion. This is a growth of around 2.5% to 4.5%. We expect operating margins around 10%. So for 2022, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $39.2 billion to $39.45 billion of revenue and an operating margin of 10.8%. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12 to $12.15 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years, with Q1 about $2.45 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter.\nLet me emphasize that this forecast is purely from operations that assumes a 16% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance has come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital.\n\nHoward Alan Rubel\n\nVP of IR, General Dynamics Corporation\n\nThanks, Phebe.

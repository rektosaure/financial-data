Welcome to the Eversource Energy Q3 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Rima Hyder, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nRima Hyder\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today on the third quarter 2025 earnings call. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted this morning on our website. You can see on Slide 1 some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward looking. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ and our explanation of non-GAAP measures and how they reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release, the slides we posted and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller.\nI will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today.\nStarting on Slide 4. Over the past 10 months, our team's relentless focus on executing on our key strategic initiatives has driven strong results and consistent performance. We are well on our way to delivering against these initiatives and ending the year on a strong note. Our strong results have also greatly improved our standing among our peers. On a year-to-date basis, our share price has been a top performer among the EEI peer group. Today, I'll walk you through how we're capitalizing on our unique market position fueling sustainable growth and strengthening the balance sheet to power our future outlook.\nMoving to Slide 5. In the last few months, we have gained more clarity on the Connecticut regulatory environment and the impact for our ongoing and future regulatory proceedings at PURA. Additionally, each day of construction that passes yields progress on the derisking of Revolution Wind. We're seeing a constructive shift in Connecticut's regulatory landscape. Last month, Governor Lamont appointed 4 new commissioners at PURA, filling out the 5-member requirement under Connecticut law. With this new commission on the way, there is now a genuine opportunity to collaborate with all parties on regulatory initiatives and to achieve more balanced regulatory outcomes. This will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers in this state and to do so with a strong focus on safety, reliability and affordability. Critical needs exist for state and regional infrastructure investments to maintain a strong, reliable and resilient grid that can accommodate new sources of generation to meet the increasing levels of projected electric demand, a transparent and predictable regulatory process is going to benefit all stakeholders, including our customers, and we are looking forward to getting back to work on Connecticut's energy goals.\nFor our ongoing Yankee rate case, we submitted a motion to adopt an alternative resolution with PURA. This was in response to PURA's request for parties to reach a consensus based resolution to reestablish trust in balance in the regulatory process and avoid further legal appeals. Our proposal includes important customer affordability provisions that we believe are supportive of all stakeholders affordability goals. We expect to see a final decision from PURA today. We remain on schedule to receive a final decision for the sale of Aquarion Water on November 19 and we continue to expect to close the transaction by the end of this year. As you may be aware, we filed a comprehensive offer of compromise to address concerns raised by the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel. The commitments that were outlined in the offer of compromise provide additional assurances that the transaction will serve the interest of Connecticut and the customers served by Aquarion Water.\nMoving on to an update on offshore wind. We have substantially completed construction of the onshore substation for Revolution Wind project. We expect to provide back feed [indiscernible] to the offshore facilities by the end of November, which will support testing and commissioning of those facilities. In parallel, we will complete the final testing and commissioning of the remaining onshore equipment. Overall, as Orsted has stated, Revolution Wind is substantially complete and work has continued since the [ stop ] [indiscernible] lifted in September. We recognized an increase to our liability to GIP in the third quarter, which was largely offset by tax benefits. We continue to support the project's owners in their completion of this important generation resource for New England.\nAs I said at the start of the call, our execution has delivered positive results and we have made great headway on our many key strategic initiatives this year. We have continued to deliver on our operational metrics with top decile reliability performance among our peers. We have significantly improved our FFO to debt ratio through constructive regulatory outcomes and managed our balance sheet to support solid credit ratings. And we know we are not done yet. We have continued to invest in transmission and distribution infrastructure across our service territories. We are on track to invest nearly $5 billion this year. We have installed over 40,000 AMI meters in Massachusetts and completed the communication network deployment in the Western portion of our service territory. These achievements are just a few that underscore the strength of our execution engine and the depth of our operational rigor.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, we have many growth opportunities ahead of us. Our service area is truly the crown jewel of the country. This area is home to cutting-edge biotech and research in the best universities and health care in the world. As these industries expand, they turn to us for a reliable, resilient grid, making us an indispensable partner in their success. We're seeing robust load growth, driven primarily by electrification of transportation and heating, decarbonization initiatives from both the public and private sectors and economic expansion across manufacturing and commercial sectors. These factors help to ensure that our growth is broad-based, durable and aligned with state sustainability goals. Year-to-date, we have seen weather-normalized load growth of 2%. In this summer, we experienced a peak of [ over ] 12 gigawatts, the highest record since 2013 as load growth in our service territory has started outpacing the impacts of distributed generation such as rooftop solar.\nThe evolving electric demand landscape presents a need for numerous transmission projects such as upgrades linking onshore and offshore wind to load centers into connections, improving regional reliability and addressing congestion as the generation mix for our region evolves. Some of the projects we are pursuing to get ahead of this continued load growth include the Cambridge underground substation, which will be the largest in the nation in 1 of 14 substations currently on the drafting table that we expect to build in Massachusetts alone to support future growth. Being opportunistic about land acquisitions in our service territory to support this growth, such as the Mystic Land acquisition we did last year with more in the pipeline, responding to requests for proposals from ISO New England to address longer-term transmission solutions, such as the most recent 1 to bring power from Northern Maine to Southern New England. These opportunities, some being outside of our 5-year forecast period could add billions of dollars to our future investment plans. Each project that we are considering not only supports our growth trajectory, but also deepens our value proposition as a great innovator.\nWe also recognize that as demand increases, affordability must remain top of mind. We are working closely with our regulators to offer our customers various options to address affordability as shown on Slide 7. We collaborate with large and small customers to design rate structures that incent efficiency. For example, earlier this year, we worked constructively with our regulators in Massachusetts to offer a 10% discount to our gas customers during the winter peak months and recover that in the summer months to smooth the impact of high bills. Similarly, starting this month, we are offering a seasonal heat pump rate in Massachusetts. Eversource electric customers who use a heat pump to heat their homes can take advantage of a seasonal heat pump rate, which is a reduced rate during the winter months. We are expanding energy efficiency programs to provide incentives for residential and low income customers who choose to adopt energy-efficient technologies. These programs, coupled with AMI give customers greater transparency and control over their energy pocketbook. Our nation-leading energy efficiency programs have already generated $1.4 billion in savings for our customers.\nWe have also implemented low-income discount rates for our most vulnerable customers, and we are recognized for our leadership in advocacy for state utility partnerships in [indiscernible] programs. We are excited about new energy supply coming into our region, which should alleviate supply cost pressure on customer bills. Over the next 12 months, Eversource is directly supporting new generation coming into the region totaling over 2,500 megawatts. We aim to deliver reliable, sustainable energy while keeping costs manageable and partnering with customers to ensure affordability through cost-effective investments, efficient operations and equitable rate design.\nBefore I hand the call over to John, I want to thank our 10,000-plus employees for their dedication, our regulators for their collaborative spirit, and our shareholders for their trust. We're executing against a clear strategy serving extraordinary customer base and working to build the grid for tomorrow, responsibly and sustainably. I look forward to your questions in sharing more details on our path forward.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John Moreira.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review third quarter earnings results, provide a regulatory update and discuss our recent financings and progress on credit metrics.\nI'll start with our third quarter results on Slide 9. As announced last month, during the third quarter, we recognized a net after-tax nonrecurring charge of $75 million or $0.20 per share related to our offshore wind liability. This charge increased our estimated liability for future payments to GIP by approximately $285 million, which was offset by $210 million of tax benefits. These tax benefits were the result of a change to previously estimated tax attributes primarily associated with Revolution Wind.\nOur GAAP earnings for the third quarter of this year were $0.99 per share, including the impact of this recent offshore wind net charge. GAAP EPS for the third quarter of last year was a loss of $0.33 per share, reflecting the impact of the sale transaction of South Fork and Revolution. Excluding the after-tax losses from offshore wind in both years, non-GAAP recurring earnings for the third quarter of 2025 were $1.19 per share compared with $1.13 of non-GAAP recurring earnings per share last year.\nNow looking at the quarter results by segment, starting with transmission. Higher electric transmission earnings of $0.01 per share were due to increased revenues from continued investment in the transmission system. Next, we have higher electric distribution earnings of $0.03 per share that reflect distribution rate increases in New Hampshire and Massachusetts provided for cost recovery for infrastructure investments in our distribution system. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher interest, depreciation, property taxes and O&M. The improved results of $0.04 per share at Eversource's Natural Gas segment were due primarily to base distribution rate increases in both Massachusetts utilities and from capital tracking mechanisms to provide timely cost recovery of investments in our Natural Gas businesses. These revenue increases were partially offset by higher interest, depreciation and property tax expenses. Water distribution earnings were lower by $0.02 per share for the quarter as compared with prior year, primarily due to higher O&M and depreciation expense.\nEversource parent earnings results were flat for the quarter, excluding the net impact from offshore wind that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, all of these segment results reflect the impact of share dilution. Overall, we are very pleased with the solid performance for the third quarter and our recurring earnings are in line with our expectations.\nMoving to some key regulatory items as shown on Slide 10. As Joe mentioned, we recently filed an alternative resolution proposal in the Yankee rate case. If adopted by PURA without modifications, the alternative resolution would waive our statutory right to appeal the final decision resulting in a fair and balanced outcome. The alternative resolution is an improvement over the draft decision, increasing revenues by approximately $104 million as compared with the PURA's draft decision of $55 million. The alternative resolution would also provide customer relief this winter to a greater extent than the draft decision by accelerating the refund of an existing regulatory liability.\nAlso, as Joe mentioned, on the Aquarion [ on sale ], PURA has maintained its final decision date of November 19 and pending that decision, we continue to expect to close the transaction by year-end. In Massachusetts, we received the approval of our NSTAR Gas PBR adjustment, and we also filed a motion for reconsideration on the NSTAR Gas rate base reset.\nNext, let me reaffirm our 5-year capital plan of $24.2 billion, as shown on Slide 11, which reflects our 5-year utility infrastructure investments by segment through 2029. As a reminder, this plan only includes projects for which we have a clear line of sight from a regulatory perspective. Through September, we have executed on $3.3 billion of our $4.7 billion infrastructure investment plan. We are very pleased with this progress, and we are on track to meet our planned target for the year. We continue to see additional capital investment opportunities in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion within the 5-year forecast period. We plan to update our next 5-year capital plan in our fourth quarter earnings call.\nTurning to Slide 12. We remain highly focused on improving our cash flow position and strengthening our balance sheet condition. As I have stated before, we expect our FFO to debt ratio for 2025 to be approximately 100 basis points above the rating agency thresholds by year-end. In fact, our Moody's FFO to debt ratio was 12.7% as of the second quarter of this year and reflects an improvement of over 300 basis points from December of 2024. We expect this ratio to be over 13% as of the third quarter.\nAs we have shared with you last quarter and as shown on Slide 13, we have executed on substantially all the items necessary to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet. As a result, our operating cash flows have continued to improve, increasing over $1.7 billion year-over-year through the third quarter.\nMoving on to our financing activity on Slide 14. While earlier this year we did not anticipate issuing long-term debt at the parent company during 2025, however, we did see the need to capitalize on favorable credit spreads, proactively prefunding an early 2026 maturity and strengthening our liquidity position. Given where our short-term debt balances were forecasted to be and in order to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity, we issued $600 million of parent company debt. On the equity side, to date, we have issued $465 million of equity under the ATM program. We expect that this level will take care of our equity needs for the near term. We also continue to pursue recovery of our deferred storm costs. As of the third quarter, 98% of our deferred storm costs are either under review or already in rates. And as a reminder, our previous cash flow improvement forecast did not assume securitization as the cost recovery mechanism for the Connecticut deferred storm costs.\nNext, I will turn to 2025 earnings guidance as shown on Slide 15. As announced in October, we are now in 2025 recurring earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.72 to $4.80 per share to a higher midpoint and reaffirming our longer-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% off of the 2024 non-GAAP EPS base. We remain confident in our EPS growth trajectory driven by disciplined execution of our strategic plan, targeted customer-focused investments in transmission and distribution are backed by constructive regulatory frameworks that enable timely cost recovery for our operations. Continued progress on storm cost recovery combined with strict O&M discipline strengthens our financial foundation and positions Eversource to deliver consistent long-term value to customers and shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call back to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

Welcome to the Eversource Energy Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker, Rima Hyder, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRima Hyder\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, FactSet Research Systems, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today on the second quarter 2025 earnings call for Eversource. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted this morning on our website. As you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections.

Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller. I will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us today. Starting on Slide 4. We have made great progress halfway through the year, executing our key strategic priorities while maintaining our commitment to being a pure-play pipes and wires, a regulated utility. As anticipated, electric demand continues to rise, both in the near term and throughout our 10-year forecast horizon. We recognize this growth trajectory early on and worked closely with key stakeholders to position ourselves to effectively meet the challenge.\nIn several regions, demand is expected to outpace existing infrastructure capacity, underscoring the critical need for strategic upgrades and new development. The accelerating electrification of transportation and heating sectors, driven by decarbonization efforts is further fueling this upward trend. Notably, low growth through the first half of 2025 has exceeded 2%, nearly double the rate observed during the same period last year, reinforcing our expectations in validating the investments we've made to capitalize on this momentum. A clear indication of this is the 10% increase in our 5-year infrastructure investment plan that we announced in February.\nOur balance sheet is strengthening and our FFO to debt ratio continues to improve as a result of constructive regulatory outcomes as well as our execution on cash flow enhancements that we laid out last year, such as exiting the offshore wind business and the planned divestiture of our water business.\nTurning to our quarterly accomplishments on Slide 5. Once again, this quarter, we saw solid earnings growth from our transmission and distribution businesses versus last year's results. Earnings for the second quarter were $0.96 a share, in line with our expectations. We are reaffirming our 2025 EPS guidance range of $4.67 per share to $4.82 per share as well as our long-term EPS growth projection of 5% to 7% through 2029.\nIn addition to our solid financial results, we had other significant accomplishments across the company. During this hot summer, we continue to maintain our top decile reliability performance even during record-breaking heat waves. I'd like to briefly acknowledge the severe weather event that impacted parts of Connecticut, Southeastern Massachusetts and Cape Cod during the July 4th holiday weekend. This storm had damaging winds well above 70 miles per hour.\nThese dangerous conditions post significant operational challenges, but our team responded swiftly to ensure safety and service continuity. I would like to thank all our employees, including crews, operations and customer services teams who worked around the clock to restore power to our customers.\nThis is also a testament to our continued investment in grid modernization, which has significantly enhanced system resilience, enabling faster and more efficient storm restoration efforts that minimize customer outages and support long-term reliability. We issued our annual sustainability report, which is available on our website. The report highlights some of our most innovative sustainability in governance achievements, including our network geothermal pilot project, our Cape Cod Card Solutions transmission project and our efforts to develop the future energy workforce.\nShifting focus to the regulatory front. Let me begin with an update on Connecticut. The Connecticut legislative session ended in early June. The general assembly passed Senate Bill 4, SB4, on a bipartisan basis. SB4 is a comprehensive energy reform bill with the stated intention of making electric bills more affordable and the utility regulation process more transparent. The bill was signed into law by Governor at the end of the month. SB4 allows for securitization of storm costs incurred by Eversource from 2018 to 2025, which is important for customer bill predictability as well as strengthening our balance sheet. The new law also clarifies the requirements of the public utility regulatory authority, including requiring that all 5 commissioners sit on all rate request proceedings moving forward.\nAdditionally, the law allows the state to use bonds to cover the cost of some public benefit programs, which are also currently recovered through a separate charge on our customers' bills. This is expected to modestly reduce their overall bill impact. We appreciate that leaders on both sides of the aisle in the general assembly are committed to ensuring a transparent and constructive process for utilities in Connecticut to deliver safe and reliable service.\nStaying with Connecticut, the Aquarion divestiture process continues to progress well. We are well into the regulatory approval proceedings in all three states, and we expect to close the seal by the end of the year. We also received a decision from the Connecticut Supreme Court on Aquarion's appeal from its 2023 rate case results. We are encouraged by the court's findings on the applicability of the legal standards for rate making, including the application of prudency standards as well as utility companies being entitled to carrying charges on deferred costs. This court ruling was an important development for future investments and cost recovery. Our focus in this legal challenge has always been to get clarity from the court on the applicability of prudent standards in order to support and defend capital investments in the future. Having the rules of the road clarified by the court is critical in this regard. It is of greater value than the evidentiary disputes on Aquarion's 2023 rate case.\nMoving on, we received a constructive decision on the rate case for a public service company of New Hampshire. We are pleased with the commission's collaborative approach on this rate case proceeding. This decision which was in line with our expectations, largely supports our investments in grid monetization, system reliability and necessary energy infrastructure needed to continue delivering safe, affordable and sustainable electricity to our New Hampshire customers. John will cover the details of this recent decision.\nWe're pleased to announce that during the second quarter, we finalized contracts that maintain positive constructive relationships with several of our key unions, representing electric and natural gas employees in Massachusetts. It's important to Eversource that we maintain these relationships with our union partners.\nTurning to Slide 6. As we invest in modernizing our infrastructure and supporting the energy transition of the future, we are equally focused on keeping costs manageable for the families and businesses we serve. Affordability is not just a goal, it's a cornerstone principle in every investment we make.\nThrough innovative solutions and strategic grid enhancements, we're enabling the integration of renewable energy resources and preparing for the increase in electric demand expected in our region. Our advanced metering infrastructure rollout in Massachusetts, is progressing very well, and we reached a major milestone in July. The AMI communication network, which started deployment earlier this year in Western Massachusetts is substantially complete. This was a critical foundational step prior to the meter installation. We have also started the construction of the communication network in Eastern Massachusetts.\nI am pleased to report that following a successful system launch last week, we have begun the installation of the first AMI meters in Western Massachusetts. The transition to AMI meters, for all Eversource, Massachusetts electric customers is expected to take approximately 3 years to complete. We are very excited to bring AMI to Massachusetts. This initiative aims to bring transparency, efficiency and reliability to energy distribution, while empowering customers to make informed decisions about their energy consumption. Even more exciting, is our key project, the Cambridge Underground substation, the first of its kind in the United States. Construction is moving ahead well since breaking ground earlier this year. Boston Properties, our partner on this project, is now advancing toward the final depth of approximately 105 feet. We are pleased that we can meet the growing needs that enable clean energy resources for Cambridge, a global center of innovation.\nThe Eversource team behind our innovative Outer Cape battery energy storage was recognized for their work on the project by the Energy Systems Integration Group. This group is an independent not-for-profit organization that galvanizes the expertise of the technical community to support grid transformation in energy systems integration. Our system was recognized for its state of the eye nature and the seamless implementation of the first of its kind systems to improve reliability for customers. Since full commissioning in December of 2022, this system has been dispatched on several occasions, avoiding sustained outages for thousands of customers during storms and other unexpected events.\nTurning to a brief update on Revolution Wind on Slide 7. You may recall that in early May, Orsted announced that the project was approximately 75% complete. We expect Orsted to update the overall project status soon. The onshore substation construction, which Eversource overseas is progressing well. We expect the onshore substation construction to be substantially complete this month. The testing and commissioning process is underway, which will allow the substation to provide back feed power to the offshore facilities in early 2026. This construction progress significantly reduces the critical path risk for Eversource.\nBefore we conclude today's call, I want to thank all of you, our employees, partners and investors for your continued trust and support. This quarter's results reflect our team's unwavering commitment to operational excellence, customer service and long-term value creation. This quarter wasn't just about performance, it was about our over 10,000 employees working together every day to keep the lights on and provide superior customer service. For line workers restoring power in the dock to our engineers design the grid of tomorrow, to customers and shareholders who trust us every day, we're proud to serve over 4 million customers across three states.\nAs we look ahead, we remain focused on delivering safe, reliable and sustainable energy while navigating an evolving regulatory and economic landscape. I will now turn the call over to John Moreira to discuss our financial results.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review second quarter earnings results, provide a regulatory update and discuss our balance sheet and credit metrics progress.\nI'll start with our second quarter results on Slide 9. GAAP and recurring earnings results for the second quarter were $0.96 per share compared with GAAP and recurring earnings of $0.95 per share last year. Higher utility earnings were largely offset by a decrease in impairment and other earnings.\nLooking at the quarter results, starting with transmission, higher electric transmission earnings of $0.02 per share were due to increased revenues from continued investments in the transmission system and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of share dilution. Next, we have higher electric distribution earnings of $0.02 per share that benefited from distribution rate increases in New Hampshire and Massachusetts providing cost recovery of infrastructure investments in our distribution system. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher property taxes, interest, depreciation and the impact from share dilution.\nThe improved results of $0.02 per share at Eversource's Natural Gas segment were due primarily to base distribution rate increases at both Massachusetts utilities, to also provide timely recovery of investment in our natural gas segment. These revenue increases were partially offset by higher O&M, interest, depreciation, property tax expenses and the impact from share dilution. Water distribution earnings improved $0.02 per share year-over-year as a result of higher revenues and lower interest expense.\nEversource parent losses increased $0.07 per share for the quarter. Lower results were as expected, primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from the absence of capitalized interest after the sale of our offshore wind business. Overall, our second quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, and we are pleased with this solid performance.\nMoving to our key regulatory items beginning with New Hampshire on Slide 10. On July 25, we received the order on the PSNH rate proceeding. We have proposed an increase of $103 million, which was amended from the original proposal of $182 million, primarily to exclude deferred storm costs, which will be considered by the commission in another docket. The audit approved a permanent rate increase of $100 million based on an ROE of 9.5% and a 50-50% capital structure. This increase includes the previously approved temporary rate increase of $61 million.\nThe PUC also approved a new performance-based rate mechanism with a 4-year term that includes annual inflation adjustments and 142 basis points This rate order is effective as of today. We will continue to evaluate all of the components of the rate order to determine next steps. While not all components of our rate proposal were adopted, we are encouraged by this constructive rate outcome that was in line with our expectations.\nMoving to Slide 11. In Massachusetts, on November 1, new rates are expected to go into effect for NSTAR Gas under the annual PBR adjustment and a potential rate base rolling which are elements of our approved 10-year PBR plan for NSTAR Gas. In addition, EGMA will have a rate increase of approximately $62 million, also effective on November 1, reflecting the second phase of the 2024 rate base rolling.\nMoving to Connecticut, we have completed the discovery phase of the hearings of our Yankee Gas rate proceeding and have provided strong support for our system infrastructure investments and cost structure. We expect a final decision in this rate proceeding in October for rates to be effective November 1. As a reminder, this filing seeks to recover an adjusted revenue efficiency of approximately $190 million, reflecting the recovery of critical investments and cost increase since the previous rate review back in 2018.\nWe also received a draft decision in the Connecticut PBR docket in July. While we appreciate PURA's work on advancing this important regulatory construct, we continue to have concerns with certain core components of this framework and are working with PURA and other stakeholders to ensure that we have alignment with the PBR structure that we can support.\nNext, let me reaffirm our 5-year capital plan of $24.2 billion, as shown on Slide 12, which reflects our 5-year utility infrastructure investments by segment. This plan reflects a 10% increase over the last 5-year plan. And as we've discussed previously, it only includes projects for which we have a clear line of sight from a regulatory perspective.\nThrough June of 2025, we have executed on $2.2 billion of our $4.7 billion infrastructure investment plan. We are very pleased with this progress and we are on track to meet our planned target for the year. We continue to see additional capital investment opportunities in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion within this 5-year forecast period.\nTurning to Slide 13. We remain highly focused on improving our cash flow position and strengthening our balance sheet condition. Our plan to enhance our cash flows is balanced by our equity needs of $1.2 billion, the majority of which is expected to be issued towards the back half of our 5-year forecast period.\nAs I have stated before, we expect our FFO to debt ratios for 2025 to be approximately 100 basis points above the rating agency thresholds. In fact, our Moody's FFO to debt ratio as of the first quarter of this year of 11.5% reflects an improvement of over 200 basis points from December 31, 2024. In early September, we met with all three rating agencies and received positive feedback on our execution of cash flow enhancements. Moody's recently reaffirmed its ratings for both Eversource Energy and NSTAR Electric, which we were very pleased to see. Unfortunately, Moody's also announced a downgrade for Connecticut Light & Power to Baa1 from A3. Moody's cited the Connecticut regulatory environment as their reason for the downgrade.\nAs we shared with you last quarter and as shown on Slide 14, we have executed on substantially all the items necessary to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet condition. As a result, our operating cash flows have continued to improve, increasing over $1 billion year-over-year through the first half of this year.\nWe also see further opportunity for customer build stabilization and balance sheet enhancement through Senate Bill 4 in Connecticut, by establishing a legal foundation for securitization of storm costs. This would certainly benefit our cash flow position and our balance sheet improvement efforts. As a reminder, our forecast did not assume securitization as the cost recovery for the Connecticut deferred storm costs.\nStaying with Connecticut. We recently supplemented our storm cost recovery filing, with an additional $171 million of storm costs for the period of February 2023 through December of 2023. This brings the total balance of deferred storm costs currently with PURA for prudency review to $980 million. We continue to believe that all of the storm restoration costs we filed were prudently incurred and should be recovered from customers. It's important to note that we now have approximately 85% of the $2 billion of deferred storm cost balance being recovered in rates or in the prudency review process across all three states.\nMoving to Slide 15, I would like to share a progress update on debt maturities at the parent level and also cover our at-the-market equity issuance program. Our plan to retire $600 million of maturing payment debt during 2025 is progressing as planned, and we are prepared to manage the final maturity this month with existing resources, as shown on the slide. We anticipate no new long-term debt issuances this year at the parent company.\nDuring the second quarter, we issued approximately $200 million of equity under the ATM program. We will closely manage further issuances and in the second half of the year as we monitor the status of the Aquarion transaction and our short-term commercial paper balances.\nNext, I will turn to 2025 earnings guidance as shown on Slide 16. With the first half of the year in the record books, we are reaffirming our 2025 recurring earnings per share in the range of $4.67 to $4.82, and our longer-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% off of 2024 EPS base. We remain confident in our EPS growth outlook, underpinned by the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Our customer-focused investments in electric transmission and distribution that are supported by constructive regulatory mechanisms, ensuring timely cost recovery for the majority of our businesses. At the same time, ongoing progress on storm cost recovery and O&M cost discipline are expected to provide a solid foundation, positioning Eversource to provide consistent long-term value to our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call back to Rima to begin our Q&A session.\n\nRima Hyder\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, FactSet Research Systems, Inc.\n\nMichelle, we're ready to begin our Q&A session."

Welcome to the Eversource Energy First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Rima Hyder, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRima Hyder\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today on the first quarter 2025 earnings call. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted this morning on our website. As you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.\nAdditional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ and our explanation of non-GAAP measures and how they reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release, the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller.\nI will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Rima. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. I am pleased to share our results and discuss the progress we have made towards our key initiatives in the first quarter of this year. This quarter, we saw strong growth across our transmission and distribution businesses versus last year, and we are pleased to reaffirm our 2025 EPS guidance as well as our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2029.\nAs shown on Slide 4, as a pure-play pipes and wires regulated utility, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our strengths in transmission and distribution investment opportunities. Our regulated status provides stability and predictability, allowing us to focus on long-term growth and sustainability that will continue to deliver on customer expectations. Over the 5-year forecast period, we are projecting rate base growth at 8% with numerous additional opportunities outside of this forecasted period.\nAs shown here, the composition of our rate base is strategically shifting toward higher distribution spend in Massachusetts, primarily to meet the state's electrification goals set in the electric sector modernization plan and conversely, the reduction of capital investment in Connecticut. We are excited to partner with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on its decarbonization strategy and to make necessary investments to meet these goals and enhance reliability. We have strong investment opportunities beyond our 5-year forecast period. We were pleased to see that ISO New England recently issued a new RFP to solicit longer-term proposals from transmission in connection with their 2050 transmission study. We are examining numerous opportunities, and we look forward to working with ISO New England on this unique opportunity to address the region's energy transition and maintain system reliability.\nAnother area of growth for us is the acquisition of the Mystic site in Everett. With its strategic location, flexibility and existing infrastructure, this facility stands out as one of the most promising multiuse interconnection points for a wide range of energy resources in New England, representing a unique opportunity to support the region's energy goals, spur economic development and create jobs. These future transmission and distribution opportunities give us confidence for growth for years to come as well as ensuring that our customers receive safe and reliable service.\nAt the heart of our operation is our commitment to customer innovation and affordability. We continue to invest in advanced technologies and innovative solutions that enhance the reliability and efficiency of our transmission and distribution networks. Our focus on affordability ensures that we deliver value to our customers while maintaining reasonable rates. We have launched several initiatives aimed at improving customer experience and reducing costs in the long term.\nAs shown on Slide 5, in Massachusetts, our AMI project remains on track with significant progress made on standing up integrating and testing the necessary systems. We began deployment on AMI communication network in Western Massachusetts at the start of this year and is now 40% complete. We expect to complete the AMI network before the first smart meter is deployed in July. We are excited about this technology and how it will empower customers to make data-driven decisions about their energy usage and provide customers with more control than ever before. Additionally, with feedback from our customers, through our robust voice of the customer program, we have implemented many user experience enhancements, including redesigning and streamlining the digital customer experience for managing their account needs.\nMore importantly, we added greater functionality and created a new redesigned account overview page on our website, making it easier for our customers to compare their bills and better understand their usage. Helping our customers understand their bill, educating them on energy-related topics and making it seamless for customers to interact with Eversource is a key objective for us. On the regulatory front, we continue to make progress across 3 states.\nEarlier this year, there was a call to action in Massachusetts from our customers, communities and state policymakers to address affordability, stabilize rates and provide transparency on energy bills. This was in response to high gas bills following the rate adjustments and increased demand due to a very cold winter. In collaboration with state leaders, we developed a plan to reduce winter rates for our gas customers by approximately 10% to smooth bill impacts during high usage periods, which went into effect beginning March 1.\nWe have also organized many events to work with and educate customers and communities we serve about the various options they have to manage their bills, including energy efficiency programs. We recognize there's more to do to address transparency and affordability, and we are actively working with the administration, legislators, communities and regulators on long-term solutions to smooth rate shocks and address affordability.\nIn Connecticut, PURA Commissioners Marissa Gillett and David Arconti have been confirmed by the state legislature, and we look forward to working with them to ensure customers continue to receive the safe, reliable electric, gas and water delivery services that they have become accustomed to over the years. In New Hampshire, we look forward to working with the new administration and partnering with them on meeting their energy goals. We continue to execute on many fronts to strengthen our balance sheet one of our key strategic initiatives was to divest Aquarion Water, which is anticipated to close by the end of the year. Last month, we filed for regulatory approval in all 3 states. The Aquarion proceeds, along with our regulatory recoveries will enable us to improve our FFO to debt ratio from 2024 levels.\nTurning to a brief update on offshore Wind and Revolution Wind project. We are pleased to report that the construction of the onshore substation, which Eversource continues to oversee is progressing very well. The onshore substation is the critical path to the project going into service. We continue to monitor the project's overall construction progress closely. Currently, given the latest construction updates and cost estimates we have been provided, we have concluded that we do not need to change the contingent liability that we recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\nIn summary, our first quarter results reflect unwavering commitment to customer innovation, affordability, financial strength and sustainability. We are focused on our 2025 key priorities, as shown on Slide 6, in the first quarter results clearly demonstrate our successful execution of these goals, showcasing our commitment to sustained growth and strategic vision as a pure-play pipes and wires regulated utility. We are confident in our ability to continue driving value for our customers and shareholders as we move forward. Our prudent and long-standing approach to financial and operational management ensures that we can continue to invest in critical infrastructure and innovation while delivering consistent returns to our shareholders.\nThank you for joining us today. I will now turn the call over to John Moreira to discuss our financial results.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review first quarter earnings results, provide a regulatory update and also discuss our balance sheet progress and credit metrics. I'll start with our first quarter results on Slide 8. GAAP and recurring earnings results for the first quarter were $1.50 per share compared with GAAP and recurring earnings of $1.49 per share last year. Higher utility earnings were largely offset by a decrease in parent and other earnings.\nStarting with transmission, higher electric transmission earnings [indiscernible] per share, reliability and load growth, partially offset by the impact of share dilution. Higher electric distribution earnings of $0.03 per share benefited from grid modernization and system improvement rate mechanisms. Additionally, base distribution rate increases in New Hampshire and Massachusetts provide a timely recovery of investments. Partially offsetting these revenue adjustments were higher property taxes, interest, depreciation and share dilution.\nThe improved results of $0.06 per share at Eversource's Natural Gas segment were due primarily to higher revenues from continued investments to replace aging infrastructure resulting in base distribution rate increases at our Massachusetts Gas businesses, including the EGMA rate base roll-in that became effective November 1, 2024, in accordance with the 2021 settlement agreement. Offsetting these higher natural gas revenues were higher O&M, interest, depreciation, property taxes and the impact from share dilution.\nWater earnings were comparable year-over-year as the first quarter is typically a very low usage period. Eversource parent losses increased $0.12 per share in 2025. Lower results were as expected, primarily due to higher interest expense and the impact from the absence of capitalized interest associated with our former offshore wind investment. Overall, our first quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, and we are pleased to start 2025 with such a solid performance.\nMoving to our key regulatory items as highlighted on Slide 9. Starting with New Hampshire, where we currently have a pending rate proceeding. Hearings in this proceeding are scheduled to start next week. In addition to recovery of previous system investments and deferred storm costs, we have proposed implementing a 4-year performance-based ratemaking plan, including a capital support mechanism that would adjust rates annually. We anticipate a final decision in July for rates to become effective August 1.\nIn Massachusetts, on November 1, 2025, new rates will be effective for NSTAR Gas under the annual PBR adjustment and a rate base roll-in. In addition, rates reflected the second phase of the 2024 rate base roll-in for EGMA of approximately $62 million.\nMoving to Connecticut. We are pleased to report that the average CL&P residential customer will see a 6% reduction on May 1 due to the implementation of the annual rate adjustment mechanism. We appreciate the progress made by PURA from the proposed decision to the final decision to provide customers with this benefit. Also in Connecticut, we have an ongoing Yankee Gas rate case, where we seek to recover a revenue deficiency of $209 million, reflecting critical investments and cost increases since our previous rate review in 2018. Hearings are scheduled for June, with a final decision scheduled at the end of October for rates effective November 1 of this year.\nNext, let me reaffirm our 5-year capital plan of $24.2 billion, as shown on Slide 10, which reflects our 5-year utility infrastructure investments by segment. This plan is a 10% increase over the last 5-year plan. As a reminder, this forecast includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. The plan includes nearly $7 billion of transmission infrastructure investments over the next 5 years, greatly enabled by efforts in Massachusetts last year, including the state's clean energy bill that reformed siting and permitting of energy facilities as well as the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities approval of the Electric Sector Modernization Plan, or ESMP. It also includes the Greater Cambridge Energy project that commenced construction earlier this year. As a reminder, this project consists of a 35,000 square foot underground substation at a projected capital cost of $1.8 billion with nearly 80% of this investment to be recovered through our transmission tariff.\nTurning to electric distribution. The capital forecast reflects over $10 billion of planned utility infrastructure investments with investments related to Massachusetts operations making up 60% of this capital plan. This includes $850 million for the AMI program in Massachusetts that Joe discussed. We have already realized significant benefits for our customers from the new billing system implemented to support AMI and we look forward to providing customers with additional benefits as we begin meter installation later this year. In addition to our base capital investment forecast, we continue to see opportunities that could provide additional investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion within the forecast period. And as Joe mentioned, we have other growth opportunities that could materialize towards the back end of our forecast period and beyond.\nLet me now turn to the subject of potential tariffs and how they could impact our O&M and capital investment plan. First, we see minimal, if any, impact on our operation and maintenance expense. Secondly, we could potentially see cost increases resulting from the tariffs impacting our capital investment plan, but we expect them to be manageable. While tariffs are disruptive to our supply chain, we have been managing through supply chain disruption for the past 5 years, especially through the pandemic years. The work we have done to expand and diversify our supply chain prior to the tariffs has positioned us well to mitigate this potential tariff risk. Through this strategic planning, we have almost no direct exposure to China where the tariff impact is slated to be the highest.\nOverall, we believe the potential cost increase to our capital projects will be approximately 3% to 6%. Should these potential tariffs put pressure on inflation, keep in mind that in Massachusetts, where we currently have performance-based rates that include an inflationary adjustment, which would allow us to recover a portion of this inflation impact. In addition, we have proposed PBR rate mechanisms in the PSNH and Yankee rate filings.\nTurning to Slide 11. To efficiently finance our customer-focused investments, we have taken a number of steps to enhance our cash flow position and improve our balance sheet profile. Our plan to enhance our cash flows is well balanced alongside our equity needs of $1.2 billion, the majority of which we expect to issue towards the back half of our 5-year forecast period. This plan also supports our FFO to debt ratio target, which we expect to improve significantly over 2024 actual results and certainly above the rating agency downgrade thresholds.\nWe continue to expect our FFO to debt targets for 2025 to be well above 100 basis points over the rating agency thresholds. As you can see on the slide, we have provided you with the rating agency thresholds at both S&P and Moody's as well as the actual 2024 results. As we shared with you last quarter and as shown on Slide 12, we have executed on all of the items necessary to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet.\nNext, I will turn to 2025 earnings guidance on Slide 13. With the first quarter in the books, we are reaffirming our 2025 recurring earnings per share in the range of $4.67 to $4.82 and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% off of the 2024 base. Our EPS growth profile will continue to strengthen as we execute on the strategic plan with customer-focused transmission and distribution infrastructure investments recovered through constructive rate mechanisms. In addition, the progress with the recovery of deferred storm costs throughout the system and continued O&M cost discipline provide a solid foundation for Eversource to return value to our investors for years to come.\nI will now turn the call over to Rima to begin the Q&A session.\n\nRima Hyder\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, John. Marvin, we are ready for question and answers now. Thank you."

Welcome to the Eversource Energy Q4 and Year-end 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Rima Hyder, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRima Hyder\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today on the fourth quarter and year-end 2024 earnings call for Eversource Energy. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted this morning on our website. As you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward looking. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections.

Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller.\nI will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. It is my great pleasure to report on another year of success in growth at Eversource. Our fiscal year 2024 closed with strong results in 3 main areas of focus. First, providing top-tier electric gas and water service to our valued customers; second, delivering steady and stable financial results with earnings per share up 5.3% year-over-year, exceeding the midpoint of our revised guidance. and third, strengthening our balance sheet, all reflecting our commitment and dedication to delivering exceptional value to our customers and shareholders.\nStarting with Slide 4. Let me take you through some of our 2024 accomplishments. Throughout the year, we've faced numerous challenges, but our unwavering focus on customers remains at the forefront of everything we do. Customer trust and satisfaction are paramount to us, and we have implemented several initiatives to enhance their experience and ensure we meet their needs. From hardening infrastructure to withstand severe weather conditions to introducing innovative customer service solutions, we've made significant progress in strengthening our relationship with our customers and key stakeholders.\nStrengthening our balance sheet was a top priority for us in 2024 and will remain a key focus area for us in 2025. We made progress toward improving our FFO to debt ratio through constructive rate outcomes, successfully issuing $1 billion of equity through our ATM program, exiting the offshore wind business and as you recently saw, entering into an agreement to sell Aquarion Water at an attractive multiple of 1.7x rate base.\nWe were thrilled to announce the sale of this truly exceptional business. Its unique value and strategic importance made it a key asset in our portfolio. Under Eversource's ownership, we built on Aquarion's long-standing track record of superior customer service, reliability and operational success, adding nearly 30,000 customers across 6 acquisitions. But this isn't just any transaction. It's a milestone that marks an exciting new chapter in our growth journey. We are pleased that the Aquarion organization will find a good home with the Aquarion Water Authority, a newly created authority alongside the RWA.\nProceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt, allowing us to reinvest capital into our regulated utilities, enhancing reliability for customers while further strengthening our company's financial position. This sale also reinforces our commitment to our core electric and natural gas operations.\nAnother one of our proud accomplishments for the sixth year in a row was that Newsweek recognized Eversource as one of America's most responsible companies. This recognition highlights our excellence in environmental, social and corporate governance areas. Also, time named Eversource to its annual list of the world's best companies. We were distinguished particularly for our commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, consideration of workforce diversity and transparent disclosure through the global reporting initiative standards.\nAs shown on Slide 5, a few of our accomplishments in 2024 targeted at advancing energy diversification are all in Massachusetts. These include implementing AMI and receiving approval for Electric Sector Modernization Plan, or ESMP, and constructing a geothermal pilot. We also completed the acquisition of the Mystic site in Everett, Massachusetts. With its strategic location, flexibility and existing infrastructure, this facility stands out as one of the most promising multiuse interconnection points for large-scale energy resources in New England, representing a unique opportunity to support the region's energy goals, spur economic development and create jobs. Purchasing this site will allow us to transform it into a premier energy interconnection hub that enhances reliability and energy supply diversity for the entire New England region.\nAnother great example of our successful collaboration in Massachusetts is the greater Cambridge Energy project that recently broke ground in Kendall Square, marking the start of an innovative $1.8 billion energy initiative. This project which is mostly a transmission investment led by Eversource includes the construction of the first fully underground electrical substation in the United States. This 35,000 square foot substation will be located over 100 feet underground beneath a newly designed public park. The project is a collaboration between Eversource Boston Properties the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority in the city of Cambridge. It's an exciting development for the community in a significant step towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.\nIn Southeastern Connecticut, working together with the 6 New England states, we were pleased to qualify for federal funding for a clean energy hub. The Huntsbuok offshore wind hub will support New England's clean energy transition while improving grid reliability across the region. With all this innovation and investment to meet state energy goals, customer affordability is always top of mind for us. We are working alongside policymakers to develop and implement strategies to mitigate customer electric grills.\nBy leveraging advancements in technology, enhancing energy efficiency programs and advocating for fair regulations, these partnerships aim to reduce the financial burden on consumers while ensuring a reliable and diverse energy supply. And by enabling more supply to come into New England, our customers will benefit from lower rates over time.\nTurning to our financial performance on Slide 6. We have continued to grow our earnings in dividend over the last 3 years on an average of 6%. We ended 2024 with over 5% growth, and we have recently increased our first quarter 2025 dividend by 5.2% on an annualized basis. John will discuss in greater detail our new 5-year capital investment plan in a few minutes. This new plan increases our investment over the next 5 years by nearly 10%, with the majority of that increase aimed at transmission investments to address aging infrastructure needs. We have tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us, both in replacing this aging infrastructure to make our system more resilient as well as building new substations and other infrastructure needs under the ESMP to address increasing load demand.\nMoving to our operational results on Slide 7. We've not only achieved our financial goals, but also have made good strides in reliability to enhance our operational performance for customers. Our electric reliability metrics once again achieved top decile performance among industry peers. More importantly, our safety metrics for the year exceeded not only the industry average, but also improved over last year's by 6%. These results reflect the Eversource brand to provide reliable and extraordinary service to our customers.\nFor example, in Connecticut, 12 years ago, the average time between interruptions was 12 months, now it's nearly 2 years. This success is a testament to the investments Eversource has made in the past, along with the hard work and dedication of our entire team, and I couldn't be prouder of what we've accomplished together. Investing in our infrastructure from improved reliability has been a decade-long process and has paid huge dividends for our customers. When there is a degradation in our investment levels, we know that reliability will likely be adversely impacted. With a stable regulatory environment, we can maintain and even increase infrastructure investments.\nTurning to Slide 8. As we look ahead to 2025, we remain committed to maintaining our momentum and continuing to prioritize our strong focus on customers in every decision we make. Additionally, we are also laser-focused on enhancing our ability to finance utility operations by achieving earnings growth during this period. John will cover our 2025 guidance and he will discuss how we build upon this year to gain momentum in raising our earnings growth rate within the 5% to 7% range over the long term.\nWe will continue to engage with our regulators across our footprint to drive regulatory relationships that are mutually productive for customers, policymakers and our investors, which starts with the ability to achieve top performance and reasonable rates for our customers. In particular, we've undertaken extensive efforts to improve our regulatory paradigm in Connecticut, seeking to identify areas for education, collaboration and consensus while seeking transparency in the regulatory environment.\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm our commitment to driving consistent growth in earnings and dividends, investing in sustainable energy future, maintaining a solid financial position and continuing our strong customer focus. Our continued effort to expand our diverse energy initiatives has positioned us as a leader in the energy transition landscape. Through strategic planning and key reliability investments, such as the ESMP and the innovative projects such as the geothermal pilot in the underground substation in Cambridge, we are delivering long-term value. to our stakeholders in contributing to our stronger and more resilient tomorrow for our customers.\nI want to extend my sincere thanks to our dedicated team of over 10,000 employees in our union partners for their unwavering support. By fostering a culture of excellence and innovation, we will ensure that we remain a trusted and reliable partner for the 4 million-plus customers we serve. Together, we are powering a sustainable and more prosperous future.\nI will now turn the call over to John to discuss our full year financial results, financial guidance and capital investment plan and also provide an update on regulatory matters. Thank you.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss the details of the Aquarion sale, review 2024 earnings results along with a regulatory update, share our updated 5-year capital investment plan and provide our 2025 EPS guidance, the 5-year financing plan and our long-term earnings growth expectation.\nLet me start on Slide 10 with a discussion of the details of the pending sale of Aquarion. As Joe mentioned, we are very pleased to have signed an agreement to sell this valuable asset. As we stated in the press release at the end of January, the aggregate enterprise value of the sale is approximately $2.4 billion. This includes approximately $1.6 billion in cash and approximately $800 million of net debt that we will extinguish at the closing. The aggregate value represents a multiple of 1.7x 2024 rate base and is approximately 35x expected 2025 earnings. This strong valuation will enable us to reduce parent company debt and thereby further strengthen the balance sheet. We expect to file change of control applications in all 3 states within the next 30 to 45 days and anticipate a closing in late 2025.\nNow I'll review the 2024 results as shown on Slide 11. Our GAAP results for 2024 earnings of $2.27 per share compared with a GAAP loss of $1.26 per share in 2023. Results for 2024 include an aggregate net after-tax loss of $2.30 per share related to closing the sales of our offshore wind investment recognized in the third quarter as well as the expected loss on the pending sale of Aquarion. As a reminder, results for 2023 included an aggregate after-tax loss of $5.60 per share that primarily related to losses on offshore wind investments. Excluding those after-tax losses, our non-GAAP earnings were $4.57 per share in 2024 as compared to $4.34 per share in 2023, a year-over-year growth rate of 5.3%. As a reminder, our revised earnings guidance for 2024 was in the range of $4.52 to $4.60 per share.\nBreaking down the 2024 full year earnings by segments, electric transmission earned $2.03 per share in 2024 as compared with earnings of $1.84 per share in 2023. The improved results were driven by continued investments in our electric transmission system to address service reliability. Our electric distribution earnings were $1.77 per share in '24 as compared with earnings of $1.74 per share in 2023. The higher results were due primarily to increased revenues from base distribution rate increases for Eversources, Massachusetts and New Hampshire Electric businesses partially offset by higher O&M interest expense, depreciation and property taxes.\nThe natural Gas Distribution business segment earned $0.81 per share in 2024 as compared to $0.64 per share in 2023. Improved results were due to higher base distribution rate increases at Eversource's Massachusetts natural gas businesses and continued investments in our gas system to replace aging infrastructure partially offset by higher depreciation, interest and property tax expenses. Excluding the loss on the pending sale of Aquarion of $0.83 per share, the water distribution segment earned $0.12 per share in 2024 compared with a $0.09 per share last year. The increase in earnings was due primarily to lower depreciation expense as a result of final rate case decision, partially offset by lower authorized revenues.\nEversource parent and other company GAAP losses were $1.63 per share in 2024 as compared to GAAP losses of $5.57 per share in 2023. Non-GAAP losses were $0.16 per share in '24 as compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.03 per share in 2023. Lower non-GAAP results for the year were due to higher interest expense and the absence of a prior year net benefit from the sale of Eversource's interest in a clean energy fund, which was partially offset by lower effective tax rate. That wraps up 2024, a very transformative year for us despite the headwinds we faced. We delivered another year of earnings growth and innovative solutions for our customers.\nMoving on to the regulatory front. We had another very busy year with positive results. Our key 2024 regulatory items are highlighted on Slide 12. Starting with Massachusetts, we received approval of our first rate base reset request for EGMA, implementing a revenue increase of $77 million effective November 1, 2024, with an additional $62 million of revenue increase that will be effective later this year. As a reminder, this adjustment was a key component of our 2020 settlement agreement when we acquired EGMA. We will have a second rate base roll in, in 2027. Also effective November 1, 2024, was the approval of $12.7 million increase in revenues for NSTAR Gas under the annual PBR adjustment mechanism. Again, in Massachusetts under the annual PBR plan, we received approval of $56 million revenue increase for NSTAR Electric effective January 1, 2025.\nTurning to New Hampshire. We continue to work through the rate review filing made last summer, where we requested an increase in distribution rates of $182 million effective August 1, 2025. As part of this proceeding, the new Hampshire PUC approved a settlement agreement for an interim rate increase of $61 million, effective August 1, 2024. The permanent rate request of $182 million includes the $61 million of temporary rate increase. Also included in this request is recovery of $247 million of deferred storm costs over a 5-year period. A decision on the New Hampshire rate case is expected in July for rates to be effective August 1, 2025. As a reminder, the final rate decision will also provide a reconciling adjustment back to August 1, 2024.\nIn Connecticut, the Yankee Gas rate review application to recover a revenue deficiency of $209 million, reflecting critical investments and cost increases since our previous rate review in 2018 continues to move along. We are in the discovery phase of the proceeding with a scheduled call for hearings in May and a final decision expected in October.\nNext, let me discuss our updated 5-year capital plan. As you can see on Slide 13, our new plan reflects a $1.9 billion increase in utility infrastructure investments for the years 2025 through 2028, the period that overlaps with our prior plan. Please note that throughout this presentation, due to the pending sale of Aquarion, we have excluded those investments from our capital plan. The $1.9 billion increase is primarily driven by higher electric transmission and higher electric distribution investments in Massachusetts reflecting greater visibility into work needed to serve our customers over the next 4 years.\nTurning to our updated 5-year capital plan that runs from 2025 through 2029 as shown on Slide 14, which reflects our 5-year utility infrastructure investments by segment. As a reminder, this plan includes only those projects that we have a clear line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective. Over this 5-year period that runs from 2025 through 2029, we expect to invest approximately $24.2 billion in our regulated electric and natural gas businesses. These investments will allow us to continue to provide customers with safe, and reliable service, meet ongoing load growth and achieved progress on our state's clean energy objectives.\nExcluding Aquarion from both time frames, the 2025 through 2029 plan is an increase of $2.1 billion or a 10% increase from our previous 5-year plan of $22.1 billion. From a segment standpoint, starting with transmission, the plan includes nearly $7 billion of transmission infrastructure investments over the next 5 years. These investments include replacement of agent infrastructure to harden the system and to increase resiliency during extreme weather events as well as innovative substation and other infrastructure projects undertaken for reliability and electrification purposes and interconnection projects, adding diversified energy resources to the grid.\nThis 5-year transmission plan is greatly enabled by efforts in Massachusetts last year, including the state's clean energy bill which reformed siting and permitting of energy facilities as well as the Department of Public Utilities approval of the electric sector Modernization Plan, or ESMP.\nOur transmission capital plan now includes engineering and development for future ESMP substations as well as significant ESMP substation investments toward end of the 5-year forecasted period. In fact, the ESMP gives us more visibility for transmission capital allowing us to raise the back end of our transmission capital forecast. We expect this trend to continue beyond the forecast period.\nTurning to electric distribution, our updated capital forecast now reflects over $10 billion of planned utility infrastructure investments with a continued focus on system resiliency and top tier electric reliability for our customers. Our planned electric distribution investments include $850 million for AMI program in Massachusetts. This technology will enable near real-time communications and includes an operating system and application environment for distributed intelligence at the meter. These enhancements will allow customers to increasingly participate in the transformation of energy usage.\nOn the natural gas side, the plan reflects nearly $6 billion of investments centered around reliability and safety. This plan is highlighted by the bare steel and cast iron pipe replacement programs in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Across the natural gas system, we'll continue to thoughtfully engage with our states to ensure investments enable an affordable transition to a clean energy future.\nRounding out our capital plan, our investments in technology and facilities forecasted at $1.2 billion, including AI and cybersecurity investments and tools to enable our employees to work more efficiently to serve customers. We are excited about the regulated opportunities this plan brings to Eversource and the positive impact it can have for our customers. We do see opportunities that could provide additional investment in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion within this forecast period. These opportunities include Connecticut AMI, solar generation, increased usage of EVs and LNG facility upgrades.\nAs we have in the past, we will update our plan as these opportunities materialize. The resulting impact to rate base growth from the updated capital plan is shown on Slide 15. The customer-focused core business investments included in the capital plan results in an 8% growth in rate base from 2023 through 2029.\nNext, I will turn to our 2025 earnings guidance on Slide 16. We are projecting an earnings per share in the range of $4.67 to $4.82 for 2025. Positive drivers this year include transmission investment for system resiliency and to address increased electric demand, gas and electric distribution rate increases, rate case outcomes in New Hampshire and Connecticut and a strong focus on reducing O&M expenses from 2024 level. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investment. Higher interest costs impact of share dilution and higher effective tax rate.\nAs Joe stated, we continue to be laser focused on improving our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 17, we executed on all our cash flow enhancing commitments for 2024 and 2025. As a result, we expect to see a significant improvement in our cash flows from operations of nearly 50% in 2025 as compared to 2024 primarily driven by timely recovery of regulatory deferrals and distribution rate increases that I previously discussed.\nWith the recent announcement of our sale of Aquarion, the $1 billion of equity that we issued in 2024, along with the projection of minimal cash tax payments through 2028 and a higher level of storm cost recoveries, our forecasted equity needs for 2025 through 2029 are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. This $1.2 billion includes the remaining $300 million left on our previous equity issuance plan or said differently, incremental equity needs of $900 million from our previous equity guidance. This equity forecast is driven by the growth in our updated capital plan, given our solid execution on our cash flow enhancement commitments, including the expected proceeds from the Aquarion sale later this year, we expect to issue the majority of this $1.2 billion of equity towards the back half of our 5-year forecast period.\nThis financing plan supports our FFO to debt ratio target well above the Moody's downgrade threshold of 13% during the forecast period. Additionally, this financing plan assumes no incremental holding company debt issuances in 2025 and assumes paying off $600 million of maturities in 2025 with internally generated cash and the expected proceeds from the acquiring on sales.\nTurning to Slide 18. We are projecting the 5-year long-term earnings per share growth rate to be in the range of 5% to 7% based off of 2024 non-GAAP recurring EPS of $4.57 per share. Given the headwinds in 2025, we expect the results to be a bit muted. However, our EPS growth profile will continue to strengthen as we execute on our strategic plan, which includes growth in transmission and distribution infrastructure investments that we are able to [indiscernible] through constructive rate mechanisms as well as significant progress with the recovery of deferred storm costs throughout the system and continued O&M cost discipline.\nBefore we get to your questions, I'll turn the call back over to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, John. I am immensely proud of our team's dedication and commitment to excellence, which has yielded a strong performance this past year. As we look ahead, we remain focused on our strategic priorities, enhancing operational efficiency, investing in regulated opportunities in delivering value to our shareholders and customers.\nI'll now turn it back over to Rima to begin the question-and-answer session.\n\nRima Hyder\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Joe. Lisa, we're ready now for the Q&A session."

Welcome to the Eversource Energy Q2 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Jacquita. I will be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Matthew Fallon with Eversource Energy Director for Investor Relations. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatthew P. Fallon\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. I am Matt Fallon, Eversource Energy's Director for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted yesterday on our website. As you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking. .\nThese statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.\nAdditional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ and our explanation of non-GAAP measures and how they reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our News Release, the slides that we posted last night and in our most recent 10-Q.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller.\nI will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Let me begin with an update on offshore wind. I am very pleased to report that we have closed the sale of Sunrise Wind project to Orsted and that we anticipate closing the sale of our South Fork and Revolution Wind projects to global infrastructure partners in the third quarter.\nClosing these deals delivers on our commitment to exit the offshore wind business and focus our resources on being a pure-play regulated utility with tremendous low-risk regulated growth opportunities to enable the clean energy transition for customers.\nTurning to Slide 3. We continue to be a leader on delivering energy solutions for our customers with our focus on resiliency investments to address aging infrastructure and minimize customer outages on blue sky days and during storm events.\nWe are also very busy preparing for the future of electrification to achieve our region's greenhouse gas reduction goals. Moving to Slide 4. Shown here are our state's near-term and long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals. To achieve these goals, we are planning investments to our grid to meet the demand growth from electrification of transportation and residential and commercial heating sectors.\nThis effort requires us to upgrade and expand the electric system to handle the new demands that we will face, including more EV charging, more customers turning to heat pumps to warm and cool their homes and expanded capacity needs to accommodate additional renewable energy resources.\nIn addition, we must make our systems smarter and stronger to withstand mother nature in the forces of climate change, which are resulting in more frequent and intense storms. We are continuing to invest in our electric system with smart technologies to help the grid automatically adjust to disturbances on the system and empower customers with more information to control their energy use.\nThese increasing demands on the electric system make it critical for us to work together with our regulators to obtain timely cost recovery and maintain a solid financial position for the company. A strong financial position enables Eversource to plan for and meet these increasing demands, while continuing to provide high levels of safe reliable service to our customers.\nTurning to Slide 5. Our nearly $6 billion in transmission investments over the next 5 years is the largest program in our company's history and is key to achieving our collective greenhouse gas reduction goals. Based on system needs our transmission investment program is moving from overhead line rebuilds in smaller reliability projects to much needed new substations to meet electrification demands in work toward a carbon-free future.\nIn our 5-year plan, these new substations and substation upgrades will equal approximately $1 billion of investment and over $600 million of transmission projects are planned to enable clean energy resources. Our 5-year transmission investment program also includes over $3 billion for investments to replace aging infrastructure.\nWe are also evaluating additional infrastructure requirements that could materialize during this forecast, and we expect incremental projects will be needed as we move forward. As we plan ahead, there are many areas of focus such as advancing the electric sector modernization plan in Massachusetts, increasing import capacity into Boston and enabling offshore wind and other renewables to advance regional decarbonization efforts that will drive transmission infrastructure investment for years to come.\nTo give you an example of the magnitude of the incremental transmission investments we are seeing over the next 10 years, we are planning for over a dozen new substations in Eastern Massachusetts alone to meet demand. Compared to just 4 new substations constructed in that service area in the past decade.\nMoving to electric distribution on Slide 6. We are preparing for substantial growth in distribution investment. In Massachusetts, our current electric distribution investment plan is nearly double the previous 5-year plan. As we move forward to prepare for significant electric demand growth in Massachusetts, to meet the state's clean energy goals. We are constantly evaluating solutions that will provide the right balance in outcomes for our customers.\nIn order to determine our distribution system investment needs in Massachusetts, we have carefully evaluated the factors that drive the needs in each specific area allowing us to plan efficiently and cost effectively for future system needs.\nTurning to Slide 7. We are very pleased with our progress of our Massachusetts AMI program, which we and other stakeholders know is critical for enabling a clean energy future. As part of the Massachusetts AMI program, we recently completed successful implementation of a new customer billing and information system, replacing a nearly 40-year-old system. This new customer system will provide a critical foundation for our AMI deployment. We are currently working on system design, building and testing of our media management and communication applications, which we expect to conclude this summer.\nNetwork construction is anticipated to start early next year with smart meter installation beginning in the third quarter next year. Our Massachusetts AMI program will deliver numerous day 1 benefits to customers, including improved grid management to enhance reliability and customer access to monitor electric consumption and control energy use. Further customer benefits include greater visibility on outages to enhance storm restoration response and dynamic rate design to enable customers to adjust electric use and lower their bills.\nAlthough we're very excited about the future transition to electrification, we are deeply committed to keeping the customer journey front and center. Affordability in fair and balanced rate design, along with the focus on environmental justice communities is top of mind for Eversource. A good example of Eversource's exploration of creative solutions to enable an equitable transition to clean energy is our first-of-its-kind network geothermal pilot and framing in Massachusetts, which came online in June.\nWe look forward to continuing our productive partnership with the state of Massachusetts as we deploy innovative technologies and pursue our carbon emission reduction goals. Turning to Connecticut. I want to thank the Lamont administration for its collaboration with utilities to provide regulatory clarity to continue the electric vehicle charging program.\nThe solution that PURA is now preparing to put in place benefits our Connecticut customers while ensuring timely and adequate recovery of program costs. As I have said before, it is critical to ensure that our customers receive safe, reliable and affordable service in a balanced regulatory environment is the best way to get there. Also, you may have heard that Governor Lamont has nominated David as the new Pure Commissioner to take the place of Vice Chairman, Makowski, who is retiring this coming January.\nWe are encouraged that David is a nominee with keen interest in energy policy and valuable experience as a former member of the Connecticut General Assembly. We are hopeful that this is a step forward in bringing Connecticut closer to its state policy goals with recognition that investment is needed to support these goals.\nTouching on New Hampshire, we continue to see positive momentum on the collaborative approach to plan for long-term energy needs with the signing of House Bill 1431 by Governor Sununu in July. This still requires utilities to file integrated distribution plans with the Public Utilities Commission every 5 years, a 10-year forecast of electric demand and an assessment of the distribution infrastructure needed to meet projected energy demands.\nMoving to Eversource's focus on our company's specific emission goals and employee development. I want to highlight the release of our 2023 Sustainability Report in our diversity, equity and inclusion report, as shown on Slide 8. Eversource has been a leader in these areas for many years, and it's a part of our DNA.\nIn this year's sustainability report, we've submitted our specific greenhouse gas reduction targets to the science-based target initiative. We also highlight the progress made towards reaching our goals of carbon neutrality from our operations by 2030 with over 30% reduction in emissions from the 2018 baseline year.\nWe are excited about the future. Eversource is uniquely positioned to leverage its skills, expertise and scale to build utility infrastructure. That will enhance system resiliency and transition to a clean energy future for our customers.\nWe have a long runway of low-risk regulated investment opportunities and earnings growth potential, focused on delivering long-term value to our customers and our investors. Thank you for your interest in Eversource. I will now turn the call over to John Moreira to walk you through our financial results and progress made towards strengthening our balance sheet.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our second quarter earnings results, provide a regulatory update and review our financing activity. As shown on Slide 9, our GAAP and recurring earnings for the second quarter were $0.95 per share as compared with GAAP earnings of $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2023 and recurring earnings of $1 per share in the second quarter of last year.\nYou will recall in the second quarter of 2023, we recorded the first of 2 impairment charges associated with our offshore wind investment of $331 million or $0.95 per share. We also had other nonrecurring charges of $6.2 million or $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Both items are included in our GAAP earnings results for 2023.\nBreaking down the second quarter earnings results by segment, starting with electric transmission, which earned $0.54 per share compared with earnings of $0.46 per share in 2023. Electric transmission earnings increased due to rate base growth. Our electric distribution earnings were $0.42 per share for the quarter compared with earnings of $0.47 per share in 2023.\nThe earnings decrease was due primarily to higher O&M expense, driven by higher storm restoration costs and the absence of a favorable prior year regulatory adjustment in New Hampshire, partially offset by higher revenues driven by Instar Electric's base distribution rate increase effective January 1 of this year.\nElectric distribution earnings are expected to be higher in the second half of the year, driven by capital cost recovery and New Hampshire's $61 million interim rate increase effective August 1. Our natural gas distribution business earned $0.08 per share for the quarter compared with $0.03 per share last year. The earnings increase was due primarily to higher revenues from Gas November 1, 2023 rate increase and lower O&M partially offset by higher depreciation, interest and property tax expenses.\nThe Water Distribution segment contributed $0.02 per share for the quarter compared with $0.03 per share last year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to higher O&M and interest costs. Eversource parent and other companies lost $0.11 per share in the quarter compared with recurring earnings of $0.01 per share last year.\nThe main driver of this decrease was higher interest expense. Overall, our second quarter earnings results were in line with our expectations, and we are reaffirming our 2024 EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.67 as well as our longer-term 5% to 7% EPS growth rate.\nTurning to our regulatory update on Slide 10, starting with Massachusetts. As you may recall, we filed our electric sector modernization plan with the DPU in January, which is a road map to address growth from electrification needs. We expect a decision on our plan later this month.\nAs a reminder, our electric sector modernization plan calls for $600 million of distribution capital investments for interconnection of clean energy resources and resiliency initiatives through 2028. This $600 million is incremental to our $23.1 billion 5-year capital forecast we announced back in February.\nNext, I'm pleased to report that in early June, the DPU approved 4 additional capital investment projects to enable the interconnection of large-scale distributed generation resources on our system. Combined with the first project approved in December of 2022, these projects represent approximately $1 billion of total capital investment with $600 million of distribution investment and approximately $400 million of transmission investment.\nThis $1 billion of investment is included in our 5-year capital plan. In May, as per our settlement agreement related to the acquisition of EGMA, we filed our first rate base reset for rates to be effective November 1, 2024. This filing reconciles our rate base, which has increased from $770 million to approximately $1.7 billion as of the end of 2023. This rate base reset is subject to a cap on the revenue change. With the application of this revenue cap, the proposed revenue increases are $78.7 million this year and $67.5 million effective November 1, 2025.\nClosing out the Massachusetts regulatory items, we were pleased to receive final approval from the Massachusetts Energy Facility Siting Board for the Cambridge substation project. This is a $1.6 billion investment, of which $1 billion of investment is included in our 5-year capital plan.\nAnd the remaining balance in 2029 and 2030. This project consists of a new underground substation that will address the growing electricity needs of the city of Cambridge and the surrounding area. Turning to New Hampshire. PSNH filed a rate case in early June to recover more than $765 million of investment since our last rate case in 2019.\nThe filing requests a rate range of $182 million in base distribution rates. That will take effect in 2 steps. The first rate adjustment will go into rates today, reflecting an increase of $61 million, with the remainder to go into effect on August 1 of next year.\nInterim rates will provide enhanced cash flows to the company until we receive a final rate decision next year. The filing proposes to recover investments made to improve reliability and includes recovery of increased costs associated with storm response and vegetation management due to the more frequent and more intense storm events.\nOn blu sky days, the company's reliability investments in New Hampshire have certainly paid off for our customers. For example, banks in large part to investments in distribution automation technology, the percentage of New Hampshire customers restored in nonstorm events in less than 5 minutes has improved from 30% in 2018 to over 50% in 2023.\nIn addition, the company has rigorously controlled O&M costs since our last rate case. We have also proposed to implement a 4-year performance-based ratemaking plan, including our capital support mechanism that would adjust rates annually to be approved by the commission.\nThis mechanism enhances cash flow supports resiliency investments, replacement of aging infrastructure and investments for the integration of customer distributed generation while maintaining the additional transparency that comes with PBR. We anticipate a final decision in this case in 2025. In Connecticut, discovery is underway on the storm cost prudency review for $634 million. We are also preparing to file for storm prudency review later this year for storm restoration costs related to events in 2022 and early 2023.\nAs Joe mentioned, we received a decision from PURA allowing us to continue supporting the electric vehicle tranching program for customers under a constructive cost recovery framework that will enhance our cash flow position. I'll now provide an update on of the items shown on Slide 11 that will enhance our FFO to debt ratio from 2023 to 2025.\nFirst, the 2024 annual rate adjustment in Connecticut became effective July 1 of this year, recovering approximately $900 million of several costs, including public benefits related costs. The July 1st rate adjustment is recovering under collections from 2023 and has reset rates to a level matching recurred cost that we expect in 2024.\nPublic benefit costs include the cost of energy supply contracts with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants and uncollectible hardship costs. Second, with the closing of our sale of Sunrise Wind to Austin, we received net proceeds of $152 million that will be used to pay down debt. Third, the closing of our sale of Revolution and South Fork Wind to Global Infrastructure Partners, we anticipate receiving gross proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion, subject to adjustments for capital expenditures.\nThese proceeds will also be used to pay down debt. As a reminder, there is no impact to our financing plan from these capital expenditure adjustments. In addition, the filings for distribution rate increases at PSNH and at EGMA will provide additional cash flow enhancement.\nAnd lastly, regarding our equity issuances, we have raised approximately $250 million of equity through our ATM program and issued approximately 819,000 treasury shares in the first half of this year. We continue to anticipate equity means of up to $1.3 billion over the next several years, as shown on Slide 12.\nWe are making progress on our effort to sell Aquarion Water Company. I'm happy to report that we have recently launched the initial phase of this process. All of the above actions give us a clear road map for improvement of our FFO to debt ratio in 2024 and give us confidence in achieving our 14% to 15% FFO to debt target at S&P in 2025.\nIn summary, as you can see on Slide 13, we have a proven track record of earnings and dividend growth, and we are confident that our robust $23.1 billion 5-year capital forecast and our forecasted financing plan will enable us to drive our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate through 2028 based off of our 2023 recurring EPS of $4.34.\nI'll now turn the call back to Matt for Q&A.\n\nMatthew P. Fallon\n\nThank you, Jequita. We are now ready for Q&A."

My name is Elissa, and I will be your moderator. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to pass the call to our host, Matt Fallon, Eversource Energy's Director for Investor Relations. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I am Matt Fallon, Eversource Energy's Director for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted yesterday on our website.\nAs you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections.\nWe undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ and our explanation of non-GAAP measures and how they reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release, the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller.\nI will now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Matt, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. Let me begin with an update on the sale of our offshore wind business. I am pleased to report that we are on track to close the sale of the 3 projects over the coming months. We are progressing well on the approvals necessary to close these transactions, as shown on Slide 3. We have filed all regulatory approvals with the New York Public Service Commission and FERC for the sale of [ self-op ] Wind and Revolution Wind to global infrastructure partners. and we recently executed the purchase and sale agreement for Sunrise Wind with Orsted.\nFor Sunrise Wind, we have also filed applications for regulatory approvals, the New York Public Service Commission and FERC. We anticipate these approvals will take about 90 days. On the construction front, I can't tell you how excited and proud I was of my Eversource colleagues as I stood alongside New York Governor [ Hocol ] to flip the switch to energize South Fork wind in March. We will certainly capitalize on lessons learned from South Fork, a first of its kind project here in the United States. The same construction processes will be used for the Revolution Wind project where onshore and offshore construction is underway.\nNow that our offshore wind risk is largely behind us, we are very excited about the future of Eversource delivering safe and reliable electric, natural gas and water service to our 4.4 million customers.\nTurning to Slide 4. Eversource is moving forward as a pure play regulated pipes and wires utility business, doing what we do best, delivering clean energy safely and reliably to our customers every day. When we are doing what we do best, our customers are the direct beneficiaries. A good example of this came in early April when a late winter storm caused significant damage across the Northeast.\nThrough our investments in technology, including smart switches and other reliability innovations, we were able to restore 85,000 customers in New Hampshire within 5 minutes, greatly reducing the impact of the storm to many customers in that area. This amazing response received numerous accolades from customers and personal acknowledgment from Governor Sununu. We take tremendous pride in our emergency response organization in our ability to stand up our emergency response teams for timely restoration.\nEversource teams from all 3 states responded to the storm damage in New Hampshire, minimizing customer outage time. Our resiliency investments help to minimize customer outage impacts. Our preparation enables us to hit the ground running in front of potential severe weather events in our emergency response plan, supports scalable and efficient restoration for those customers who are impacted. And we work tirelessly to communicate that timely recovery of storm costs is critical to support these efforts.\nTurning to the Clean Energy future. As you can see on Slide 5, the states we serve have very aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals. Both the transportation sector in residential and commercial heating sectors, are the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Although the region has acted by reducing carbon emissions from power generation, we have a long way to go on heating and transportation to achieve the state's targets by 2050.\nTo meet these targets, we project that average household electric demand will double in the summer and more than triple in the winter. That's why it's critical that we all work collaboratively and get started today on making achievement of these targets a reality.\nMoving to Slide 6. Achievement of Massachusetts decarbonization goals are being addressed in part through the Electric Sector Modernization Plans, or ESMP. This is the most comprehensive clean energy plan in the nation with planning processes and requirements that will provide the pathway for the state to achieve its clean energy objectives. The Eversource ESMP is a product of our system planning process, incorporating the state's assumptions for projected demand growth from electric vehicles in electric heating.\nTo develop our ESMP, we have analyzed expected electric growth down to the circuit level, to identify grid investments needed over the next 5 years and beyond. These infrastructure investments will convert our distribution grid into the platform for the clean energy transition. It will increase electrification capacity by 180% and will allow for the adoption of 2.5 million electric vehicles, 1 million heat pumps and 5.8 gigawatts of solar generation, thereby making Massachusetts, a leader in delivering Clean Energy to its homes and businesses.\nIn New Hampshire, we are focused on a number of regulatory initiatives and are evaluating ways to advance Clean Energy initiatives such as large-scale utility-owned solar development. For example, New Hampshire state legislators are working on a bill that would institute structural reforms to New Hampshire's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Committee or the SEC. Reducing the size of the SEC from 9 members to 5 and eliminating unnecessary process to improve efficiency and to lead to more consistent outcomes. In turn, this will lead to an accelerated citing and permitting process for these clean energy initiatives.\nTurning to Connecticut. State policy leaders have a vision of solar expansion, electric vehicle adoption and future renewable purchase power agreements as part of its Clean Energy transition. We are a strong supporter of these efforts to enable the Clean Energy future for our customers, and we certainly are looking to partner with the state collaboratively and productively to achieve this important vision for our customers. While we continue to work diligently to support state policy leaders on thoughtful and reasonable policies aimed at increased adoption of Clean Energy technologies and the reduction of carbon emissions. We have serious concerns with the lack of alignment between state policy and regulatory decisions, implementing that policy.\nAs it stands, regulatory policies in Connecticut discourage investment and utility innovation as well as our participation in a wide range of Clean Energy initiatives that rely on our balance sheet, in our capital resources. Upfront program funding by the utilities does not work where cost recovery is continually deferred and delayed into the future on certain terms. Without recognition that our funding sources rely on a secure and predictable cost recovery path, we cannot move forward to put additional capital resources on the table.\nWe are encouraged by PURA's decision last month to provide timely reimbursement of deferred public policy costs through the company's electric annual rate adjustment mechanism. Decisions that adhere to war in legislative policy are critical to assure a constructive regulatory environment in Connecticut and to make the vision of a Clean Energy future a reality for our customers.\nLooking forward to the future, we remain committed to our extensive outreach plan across Connecticut, furthering our efforts to engage collaboratively and productively with Connecticut's leadership.\nLastly, I want to thank my Eversource colleagues for their unwavering commitment and dedication to our customers. I have the utmost confidence in our team to deliver safe and reliable energy service to our customers with daily progress toward a clean energy future.\nI will now turn the call over to John Moreira to walk through our financial results.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our first quarter financial results, give you a regulatory update and cover drivers for our cash flow enhancement.\nI'll start with the first quarter results on Slide 7. Our GAAP and recurring earnings for the quarter were $1.49 per share compared with GAAP and recurring earnings of $1.41 per share last year. Breaking down the first quarter earnings results of the $1.49 per share in 2 segments, our electric transmission earned $0.50 per share compared with earnings of $0.45 share in 2023.\nImproved results were driven by our continued investments in our transmission system to address capacity growth for customers and connect clean energy resources to the region. Our electric distribution earnings were $0.48 per share compared with earnings of $0.47 per share in 2023. Higher revenues primarily due to a base distribution rate increase at NSTAR Electric were partially offset by higher operating expense, higher interest expense and increased property taxes and depreciation.\nOur natural gas distribution business earned $0.54 per share compared with $0.49 per share in 2023. Natural Gas distribution earnings increased due to higher revenues from capital cost recovery mechanisms, a base rate increase at NSTAR Gas and lower operating expenses. Our water distribution segment contributed $0.01 per share compared with flat earnings in 2023.\nEversource parent and other company earnings were a loss of $0.04 per share compared to breakeven results in 2023. The lower results were due primarily to higher interest expense and the absence of a net benefit in the first quarter of last year from the liquidation of a renewable energy fund.\nOverall, our first quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, and we are reiterating our 2024 EPS guidance of $4.50 to $4.67 per share as well as our longer-term 5% to 7% EPS growth rate.\nTurning to regulatory items on Slide 8, starting with Massachusetts. We filed our electric sector modernization plan with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utility in January. And we expect to have a decision on our plan in the August time frame. Our ESMP calls for an incremental $600 million capital investments for interconnection of solar resources through 2028. As a reminder, this $600 million is incremental to our $23.1 billion capital investment forecast we announced back in February.\nIn New Hampshire, we are very busy on the regulatory front. In March, we submitted our documentation for a prudency review of $232 million of storm costs related to storm events from August 2022 through March of 2023. We anticipate that review will be completed later this year. In addition, we anticipate filing a rate review in New Hampshire this summer, with temporary rate relief going into effect 90 days after the final.\nClosing out the regulatory update is Connecticut, where we received the final decision on our annual rate adjustment mechanism 2 weeks ago, for new rates to become effective July 1 of this year. The major drivers of the $873 million increase are recoveries of purchase power contracts and protected hot chip uncollectible accounts, both of which are costs required by law.\nThese undercollected costs in Connecticut, which were approximately $400 million in 2023, contributed significantly to a reduction in our 2023 FFO to debt ratio. This rate impact will be significantly offset by lower energy supply costs that will also go into effect July 1 of this year. We appreciate PURA's decision to provide timely reimbursement to the company of these state policy costs as required by law, reducing the pressure on our balance sheet to finance these costs for a longer time period.\nTimely recovery of these costs reduces the total amount that customers will pay through avoidance of carrying charges on these balances. In March, we resubmitted our request for a prudency review of approximately $635 million of Connecticut storm costs relating to weather events that occurred from 2018 through 2021. The vast majority of these costs represent payments to outside line and 3 crews to assist in the registration, resulting from '24 significant storm events during that period.\nWe are currently in the discovery phase of the proceeding. As a reminder, recovery of these costs will coincide with new distribution rates following our next general distribution rate proceeding.\nIn early April, following the superior court decision on our Aquarion rate case, we filed for a review of that decision by the appellate Corp. along with a request to transfer the appeal directly to the Connecticut Supreme Court. We are requesting that the Connecticut Supreme Court hear in this case due to the critical legal issues raised by the Aquarion rate decision. Without proper resolution of these issues, there will be a negative impact on utility investment and customers long term.\nAs Joe mentioned, we are committed to our extensive and ongoing outreach efforts that have been pivotal to educating key leaders and communities on the necessity for stable regulatory policies. We are also demonstrating our commitment to support the state's policy leaders who seek to move the state forward with thoughtful and reasonable policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and achieving increased adoption of clean energy resources.\nA successful path to a Clean Energy future will require a substantial ramp-up in planned proactive distribution infrastructure investment rather than piecemeal approach as well as sound public policies and adherence to legal principles to enable that investment. However, the existing gap between the state's vision of a transition to a clean energy future and the regulatory framework discouraging investment is an obstacle for Connecticut's progress on climate change, the Clean Energy transition and even core service goals.\nAs a result, we have taken a hard look at our capital deployment priorities and are implementing necessary cuts to our Connecticut investment levels in 2024 and over the next 5 years. In 2024, we are reducing our capital expenditures by nearly $100 million. And we have notified PURA of our unwillingness to put capital at risk in relation to advanced meter infrastructure and electric vehicle programs. In total, we are expecting to reduce capital investment in Connecticut by $500 million over the next 5 years. Until we see Connecticut's regulatory decisions come back into alignment with law and state policy, our decisions on the deployment of our valuable capital resources have to be based on our current experience with regulatory outcomes for utility investment.\nWith that, I do want to emphasize that we are confirming our 5-year capital expenditure forecast of $23.1 billion across all business units, substantial consistently emerging infrastructure needs across our system provide ample opportunity for capital deployment in lieu of using those valuable resources in Connecticut.\nI will now cover a number of drivers that are expected to enhance our FFO to debt ratio from 2023 to 2025. As you can see on Slide 9, the under-collection of 2023 deferred state policy costs, which will now be recovered as a result of the 2024 annual rate adjustment decision in Connecticut as well as other under recoveries of regulatory deferrals across all states of approximately $200 million contributed to the lower FFO to debt that we experienced in 2023. We expect other enhancements in 2024 and 2025 that include the sale of South Fork and Revolution Wind assets to GIP Upon closing of the sale to GIP, we anticipate receiving approximately $1.1 billion of cash proceeds from this transaction.\nIn addition to the GIP sale proceeds, we anticipate utilizing our tax equity investment in South Fork win, which we expect will bring around $500 million of cash over the next 24 months.\nLastly, collection of storm costs in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, planned rate increases at our utilities, the sale of our Sunrise Wind project to Orsted, equity issuances and cash flows from a potential sale of our water business will drive the enhancement of 2023 FFO to debt to 14 to 15 targeted by 2025.\nMoving on to our equity issuances. In the first quarter of 2024, we raised approximately $75 million through our existing ATM program. And we issued 550,000 treasury shares. We continue to anticipate our equity needs to be up to $1.3 billion over the next several years.\nAlso, as we announced in February, we are undertaking a review of our water distribution business. Proceeds from a successful sale are assumed in our long-term financing plan reducing the level of equity that would otherwise be needed. We continue to prepare materials needed to launch the first phase of this process.\nClosing out on Slide 10, as I mentioned earlier, our $23.1 billion 5-year capital forecast and our forecasted financing plan drive our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate through 2028 based off of our 2023 recurring EPS of $4.34 per share.\nI'll now turn the call back to Matt for Q&A.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, John. Elissa, we are now ready for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nHello, and welcome to the Eversource Energy Q4 and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Elliot, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand over to Bob Becker, Director for Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us on Bob Becker, Eversource Energy's Director for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides we posted yesterday on our website. And as you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward looking. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections.\nWe undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ and our explanation of non-GAAP measures and how they reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release, the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q. Speaking today will be Joe Nolan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller. Now I will turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Bob, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning and for your interest in Eversource. Let me begin with the pathway for a full exit of our offshore Wind business on Slide 4. When we started down this path in 2016, we were very excited for the opportunity to bring much needed renewable energy to our region.\nThe high supply prices in the Northeast are not good for anyone, particularly our customers. Until we can reduce the region's reliance on gas, by electric generation price volatility will continue to cause difficulties for our customers. State mandates for our offshore wind procurement provided a strong impetus for our engagement, along with the recognition that offshore Wind is one of the few renewable resources that can be produced in quantity to reduce reliance on natural gas and dampen the volatility of our region's electric prices.\nUnfortunately, our offshore Wind investment experienced difficulties as early-stage projects. These difficulties were largely a result of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and uncertainty around available resources for installation vessels and fabrication of turbine foundations. We are not alone, as several other offshore wind developers have also experienced similar challenges. These challenges, coupled with the lack of pricing flexibility, inherent in contracts approved by state regulators, result in a projected investment returns substantially below our required thresholds.\nAt the same time, our core business is well positioned to deliver solid operational and financial results, as we move forward in supporting the region's transition to a cleaner energy environment. This led us to seek out a path to refocus our investment portfolio on our Utility business, with its strong opportunities for growth. For this reason, I am pleased about our announcement that we have reached an agreement to sell our existing 50% interest in the South Park and Revolution Wind projects, to global infrastructure partners, our leading infrastructure investor that will generate approximately $1.1 billion of cash proceeds.\nWith the pending sale to GIP, our announcement last month, regarding the conditional sale of Sunrise Wind to Orsted and the sale of the Offshore Wind lease area that closed last year, I'm pleased to say that we have the pathway in place to finalize a full exit from the Offshore Wind business.\nFor the year, we have taken a noncash cumulative impairment charge of approximately $1.95 billion, after tax. John will discuss the impairment in more detail. However, I will say that the impairment reflects assumptions that our Board views as appropriate, given the uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of the Sunrise Wind rebid process.\nAs John will discuss, the terms of the agreement with GIP are assumed and reflected in the impairment charge in our long-term financing plan. By taking this impairment charge, we are accounting for our full exit from Offshore Wind. We are pleased to be in the final stage of this long journey, and we feel confident that we are turning over the range of the Wind business to capable and committed parties. We will remain involved in managing onshore construction for all 3 projects and through our tax equity investment in the South Park.\nI'll close my comments on Offshore Wind, with a brief update on the status of the project construction activity. As the first utility scale, Offshore Wind farm in commercial operation in the U.S., South Park Wind has been supplying power to Long Island since late November 2023, when the first turbine was installed. We are now in the process of installing the 12th and final turbine. We expect all turbines to be reducing power by March.\nWe continue to advance on both onshore and offshore construction of Revolution Wind, after reaching a positive final investment decision in October of last year. Work on the site of the new onshore substation in Rhode Island, has been underway since late last year. Seabed preparation for the installation of wind turbine foundations is currently in process.\nLastly on Sunrise Wind, we continue to get closer to the bonds record of decision, while we await the results of the latest submission into New York's RFP floor. We made this submission jointly with Orsted, on January 25. Next, let me discuss the Water Distribution announcement, we made last evening, shown on Slide 5. Our Water business is a valuable, well-performing and well-managed company.\nAlthough the Water business is earnings accretive to Eversource, we see the potential seal of our Water business, as an opportunity to reduce equity needs and improve our regulatory diversity. With its current $1.3 billion rate base in a national reputation for operational excellence, the Water business has a strong potential to be of substantial value to another owner, as part of a larger Water business, our strategic infrastructure platform.\nAs a result, we plan to launch a process for evaluating market interest in a transaction for the Water business, with the objective of delivering value to both customers and investors. If successful, the proceeds from the seal will provide a source of cash without going to the equity market, thereby enhancing our balance sheet.\nMoving forward, Eversource will focus on the delivery of clean, safe, reliable energy to our customers and preparing for the clean energy future that our states, our customers and our investors expect. Now I'll turn to our excellent financial and operating performance results on Slide 6.\nStarting with the financials. We delivered another strong year with reoccurring earnings of $4.34 per share in 2023, representing growth of nearly 6% over 2022. Our Board has approved a dividend increase for the first quarter 2024 of $0.715 per share. Which amounts to $2.86 per share on an annualized basis. This reflects an increase of 6% over 2023's dividend level.\nMoving to operations. I am extremely proud of our team once again for delivering reliable Electric, Natural Gas and Water service to our 4.4 million customers. As you can see, our Electric reliability ranks in the top decile among our peers. We're focused on providing reliable Electric service to our customers, who on average have gone nearly 2 years, without an outage.\nIn 2023, Eversource again outperformed its target injury rate. Our teams are keeping a strong focus on safe work practices not just during major storm events, when conditions are tough, but every day on every job. On Natural Gas safety, once again, the team delivered another strong year, replacing 145 miles of Natural Gas pipeline and delivering on-time emergency response times of 98% within 45 minutes. A performance that well exceeds our regulatory requirements. I want to congratulate the Eversource team on these accomplishments. I am very proud of the skill and commitment of the entire team in the way that our employees are aligned in our shared vision of providing the highest level of safety, innovation, service quality and financial discipline for the benefit of our customers.\nTurning to Slide 7. at Eversource, we know our customers expect us to not only deliver energy today, but also to be prepared for the future. To that end, we are actively engaging with our states to enable the Clean Energy future that our customers and our communities envision. At the end of January, we submitted our Electric Sector Modernization Plan, or ESMP to the Massachusetts to pop and public utilities. After extensive input from the Grid Modernization Advisory Council and stakeholders across the commonwar.\nThe ESMP is the road map for building out the Electric infrastructure and technology platforms to enable a reliable transition to a Clean Energy future in alignment with the state's Clean Energy plan. The filing specifically addresses the coming 5 and 10 years with a vision toward an 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nEversource has taken a leadership role in this endeavor and is viewed as a trusted partner at the table and planning the Clean Energy future for Massachusetts. We expect that the pop and public utilities to issue a final decision on our plan in August of 2024, addressing approximately $600 million of proposed incremental investment, among other components.\nIn Connecticut, we are continuing to work on our comprehensive outreach plan with participation from across the company. We are leveraging our internal talent to educate Connecticut's stakeholders on the importance of infrastructure investment to our customers in the broader Connecticut economy, as well as the affordability programs that we offer to customers. This approach has proven to be productive, in terms of raising awareness on the value of utility investment. And on the point that Eversource is BPA that is ready, willing and able to help Connecticut meet its Clean Energy goals.\nLastly, in New Hampshire. We are gearing up for a number of regulatory initiatives, including a potential PPI proposal, in evaluating ways to help the state advance Clean Energy projects, such as large-scale solar development. We're excited about the role Eversource will continue to play, to enable a Clean Energy future that's affordable and equitable for all customers. We'll continue to engage with all stakeholders to move this massive complex effort forward.\nTurning to Slide 8. As you may know, Eversource is an industry and market leader in environmental, social and governance. We continue that focus in 2023. We expanded the charter of the Board's governance, environmental and social responsibility committee, to extend this oversight to include climate-related matters. The full Board receives regular reports on our climate-related goals, key industry updates and policy activity through the Eversource climate scorecard.\nWe continue to make progress on reaching our carbon neutrality goal by 2030, and we submitted our application for a new science-based target in December. I'm pleased to report that due to our continued leadership on ESG, last week, Eversource was named one of America's Most Just Companies, as announced by Just Capital in CNBC, for the fifth consecutive year. We have a very exciting future here at Eversource, focused on what we do best. I will now turn the call over to John Marrero.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe. And good morning, everyone. This morning, I will cover our 2023 financial results, the Offshore Wind impairment, the 2023 regulatory update, an update of our 5-year investment forecast for our regulated businesses. And I'll wrap up with our 2024 recurring earnings guidance, long-term financing plan, and 5-year earnings and dividend growth guidance.\nI'll start with 2023 results on Slide 10. Our GAAP results for the year were a loss of $1.26 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $4.05 per share in 2022. In the fourth quarter, results were a loss of $3.68 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.92 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nResults for the full year 2023 include an after-tax impairment charge of $5.58 per share, related to our Offshore Wind investment and $0.02 per share after-tax charge related to our nonrecurring costs. Results for 2022 include a $0.04 per share charge, primarily related to transition costs associated with a completed integration of eGMA.\nExcluding these charges and the Offshore Wind impairment, our non-GAAP recurring earnings were $4.34 per share in 2023 as compared to $4.09 per share in 2022. Breaking down our 2023 full year non-GAAP recurring earnings of $4.34 into segments. Electric Transmission earned $1.84 per share for 2023, as compared with earnings of $1.72 per share in 2022.\nImproved results were driven by continued investments in our Transmission System and lower income tax expense. Our Electric Distribution earnings were $1.74 per share in 2023, as compared with earnings of $1.71 per share in 2022. A base distribution increase at NSTAR Electric was partially offset by higher interest expense, property taxes and depreciation.\nOur Natural Gas Distribution segment earned $0.64 per share in 2023, as compared to $0.67 per share in 2022. Increases in depreciation and interest expense higher effective tax rate and the impact of certain reconciliation charges exceeded the revenues we received from capital trackers and base rate increases at NSTAR Gas and eGMA that became effective November 1, 2022.\nOur Water Distribution segment earned $0.09 per share in 2023, compared with $0.11 per share in 2022. Lower results were driven by higher depreciation, O&M expense and interest expense. The results reflect the impact of a very disappointing decision in Connecticut, from PURA for the Aquarion water rate case, which is under appeal.\nEversource parent and other companies' earnings were $0.03 per share in 2023, as compared with a loss of $0.12 per share in 2022. The improved results reflect a lower effective tax rate and the gain on our planned liquidation of a renewable energy fund, partially offset by higher interest expense and a contribution to the Eversource Charitable Foundation.\nLet me now turn to Offshore Wind, starting with the highlights of our sale of South Fork and Revolution Wind to GIP. With South Fork Wind expected to be in service before the transaction closes, our construction contingency is primarily related to Revolution. The terms of the transaction include a capital cost sharing agreement. Under this agreement, capital expenditure overruns incurred for the 50% interest in the project, up to approximately $240 million will be shared equally between Eversource and GIP.\nAbove this threshold, 50% of any project cost overruns would be borne by Eversource. If the final project costs come in under the current construction forecast, Eversource will receive a payment for this difference. The terms and pricing of this agreement with GIP are assumed in the impairment charge and in our long-term financing plan.\nLet me review the Offshore Wind impairment, as shown on Slide 11. In 2023, we recorded impairment charges on our Offshore Wind investment of approximately $2.17 billion pretax or $1.95 billion after tax. As you can see on this slide, the impairment charge was driven by a lower-than-expected sales value of approximately $400 million for the 3 projects, after completing our strategic review in the second quarter of last year.\nAs a result of adverse developments in the fourth quarter, including the further reduction in the expected sales prices driven by higher project costs and the October 2023 denial of the OREC pricing petition for Sunrise Wind, we realized an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of approximately $1.77 billion.\nThe Sunrise Wind project drove about $1.22 billion of the impairment charge. In large cap due to the OREC repricing denial, which led to a lower assumed revenues and ultimately, an evaluation of the potential abandonment cost of Sunrise, if it is unsuccessful in the New York RFP for solicitation.\nAs a reminder, to participate in the process to submit a rebid in the solicitation NYSERDA required any existing projects to terminate their current OREC agreements. This potential loss of both a contract revenue stream and ultimate project viability and any related termination costs was factored into our impairment analysis. Therefore, we assume that if Sunrise is not successful, in the rebid. This would result in no sales proceeds and no value attributable to the ITC adder.\nThese items, coupled with estimated cancellation costs for the project, net of any salvage value, drove the additional impairment charge. Although we have factored this downside set of assumptions and probabilities into our impairment analysis, if Sunrise is ultimately successful in the RFP, Eversource would then sell its ownership interest in the project to Orsted, under the terms of our recently announced agreement. With the completion of that sale, our interest in Sunrise would be terminated. We would not be subject to any further construction contingencies or project cancellation costs.\nIf we are successful selling Sunrise to Orsted, it would provide a full exit for the Offshore Wind business. Turning to Slide 12. I'll walk you through the carrying value of our Offshore Wind investment, as of December 31, 2023. The carrying value that I will discuss reflects the impact of our fourth quarter impairment charge by project.\nAs you can see, the value of both Sunrise and Revolution were impacted by the fourth quarter impairment. The value of South Fork was not impacted. The fourth quarter impairment charge assumes a set of scenarios regarding potential construction contingencies for Revolution Wind. The charge also assumes that Sunrise Wind would be abandoned. We are very disappointed by the financial impact recognized on these early-stage Offshore Wind projects.\nHowever, we are comfortable with the impairment charge assumptions. We have reflected these assumptions in our long-term financial plan, which I'll cover in a minute. As we move forward and finalize the sale of these projects, including the result of the recent New York RFP 4, the ultimate carrying value of our Offshore Wind investment, could change accordingly.\nOn the regulatory front, we had another busy year. Our key 2023 regulatory items are highlighted on Slide 13. Starting with Massachusetts, we completed proceedings on our 2018 to 2021 storm cost recovery request, of approximately $136 million. I'm pleased to report that the Massachusetts DPU conducted a very thorough review, and we received approval to recover 100% of our request. This approval highlights the importance of our storm response and acknowledges the tremendous effort from my Eversource colleagues and our contractors to restore customers as quickly and as safely as possible.\nAlso in Massachusetts, we received approval of our first annual revenue adjustment under NSTAR Electric's PBR plan. This adjustment included an increase of a capital adjustment factor or KBA, as we call it. Turning to New Hampshire. We received the final order of proven $47 million of storm cost recovery, for weather events occurring in 2020 and in 2021. Again, we were granted nearly 100% of our request. We expect to file a general rate review in New Hampshire later this year, to recover the cost of investments that we have made over the last 4 years to significantly improve reliability for customers in New Hampshire. In total, we are now recovering approximately $400 million in rates, over the next 5 years for storm costs in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\nIn Connecticut, at the end of December, we filed our request for a prudency review of approximately $635 million of storm costs, relate into weather events that occurred from 2018 through 2021. The Connecticut filing contains more than 10,000 pages of support for costs incurred for these significant weather events. We look forward to working through the prudency review with PURA in 2024.\nLastly, in our Aquarion's appeal of its March 2023 rate decision, oral arguments were held on January 11, and we expect the court decision over the coming months. Turning to our regulated utility capital plan. Slide 14 reflects our 5-year utility infrastructure investments, by segment updated through 2028. As a reminder, this plan reflects projects that we have a good line of sight on from a regulatory approval perspective.\nOver this 5-year period, we expect to invest approximately $23.1 billion in our regulated Electric, Natural Gas and Water businesses, to continue providing customers with safe and reliable service to meet ongoing load growth and to achieve progress on Clean Energy objectives.\nStarting with Transmission. Our plan includes nearly $6 billion of Transmission infrastructure investments, over the next 5 years. These investments include replacement of agent infrastructure to harden the system and increase resiliency during extreme weather events. Innovative substation projects undertaken for reliability and electrification purposes and interconnection projects, adding Clean Energy resources to the grid.\nOur Transmission capital plan includes a launch, scale, innovative project to build a substation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, completely underground. We are working closely with the city on this project, which includes nearly $1 billion of investments to interconnect 4 existing transmission lines. This project will increase capacity to enable electrification and improve the reliability of Electric service for customers.\nTurning to Electric Distribution. Our updated capital forecast now reflects nearly $10 billion of planned utility infrastructure investments, with a continued focus on system resiliency and our top-tier reliability for Electric Service. Our planned Electric Distribution investments include over $0.5 billion of our AMI program, in Massachusetts. The AMI program will allow customers to save money through heightened control over their own energy consumption and to experience higher service levels through faster outage restoration and other service functions.\nOn the Natural Gas side, our 5-year plan reflects nearly $5.5 billion of investments and is centered around reliability and safety. The plan is highlighted by our Bare Steel and [ cast in ] pipe replacement programs in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Across our Natural Gas system, we'll continue to thoughtfully engage with our states to ensure our investments enable equitable transition to a Clean Energy future.\nTurning to the Water segment. Our 5-year investments are forecasted to be over $1 billion, supporting investments in water treatment facilities and water main replacements to improve water quality. Rounding out our Eversource capital plan, our investments in technology and facilities that's forecasted at $1.1 billion.\nMoving to Slide 15. Our updated capital plan reflects a $1.6 billion increase in utility infrastructure investments from 2024, through 2027 versus the prior plan. This increase reflects greater visibility on the work needed to serve our customers over the next 4 years. An important consideration in relation to our 5-year capital plan is what has not been included.\nOn the right-hand side of the slide, we show some potential infrastructure investments not currently included in our forecast, which would be additive to the plan. These opportunities total up to in forecast period with Connecticut AMI at the top of the list at nearly $700 million. The resulting impact from our updated capital plan, is shown on Slide 16. The customer-focused core business investments included in our capital plan would result in 7.7% growth in rate base from 2022 through 2028.\nNext, I will turn to our 2024 earnings guidance on Slide 17. We are projecting a non-GAAP recurring earnings per share range of $4.50 to $4.67 per share for 2024. Positive drivers this year include Transmission investments for system resiliency and increased Electric demand, distribution base rate increases in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, continued focus on controlling O&M expense and a lower effective tax rate.\nIn 2024, our planned Distribution rate increases include the first rate base roll-in for eGMA, which will adjust rates to recover 6 years of capital investments. This rate adjustment will take effect in November of this year. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by higher expenses related to increased capital investments and share dilution.\nTurning to our long-term financing plan. I'll start with our cash flow assumptions regarding Offshore Wind, as shown on Slide 18. As I said earlier, our Wind impairment reflects a set of assumptions that we have also embedded in our long-term financing plan. Let me walk you through what is assumed in our financing plan.\nFirst, we assume cash inflows from the announced sale of South Fork and Rev Wind of $1.1 billion. These proceeds include the value of the 10% ITC adder for a Revolution Wind of approximately $170 million. Also assumed in our financing plan, is the realization of our tax equity investment in South Fork Wind, which we expect will bring in around $500 million of cash over the next 24 months. The last item is related to our sale of Sunrise Wind to Orsted, which is not assumed in our long-term financing plan.\nIf Sunrise is successful in the New York RFP for that would be a positive to our plan. I'll now cover a number of drivers that are expected to enhance our FFO to debt ratio from 2023 to 2025, as you can see on Slide 19. These drivers include the Offshore Wind proceeds that I just discussed, planned rate increases at our utilities, recovery of storm cost deferrals, scheduled equity issuances and proceeds from a potential sale of our Water business.\nIn terms of the equity assumed in our plan over the next several years, we expect to issue up to $1.3 billion of equity through our existing ATM program. We will also continue to be opportunistic with our alternatives. As Joe mentioned, we are undertaking a review of our Water Distribution business. Proceeds from a successful sale are assumed in our long-term financing plan, reducing the level of equity that would otherwise be needed.\nAs you can appreciate, we cannot provide any additional details beyond what we've disclosed. We will keep you updated on any decisions from this evaluation and any changes in our financial guidance. Closing now on Slide 20, our robust 5-year capital plan and long-term financing plan drive our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate, through 2028. To be clear, the 5% to 7% is based off of our 2023 recurring EPS of $4.34. Before we get to your questions, I'll turn the call over to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, John. As I previously said, I'm very excited as I look ahead to the future of Eversource. This amazing team that delivers every day is on the brink of a critical energy transformation, that will benefit our customers, our communities and our environment.\nThe need for utility infrastructure investment has never been greater. In fact, in a draft study released last year, ISO New England projected a need, for up to $15 billion of Transmission investment, to meet the region's 2050 Clean Energy objectives. As we look ahead, we see a tremendous need for a collaborative approach to leverage our utility infrastructure development and superior offering skills in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut. On that note, I want to thank you for your interest in Eversource, and I look forward to seeing you soon. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob, and we look forward to answering your questions.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. ."

My name is Alex, I'll be ordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand it over to your host, Robert Becker, Director for Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Bob Becker, Eversource Energy's Director for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides we posted on our website. And as you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward looking. These statements are based on management's current expectation and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ and our explanation of non-GAAP measures and how they reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release, the slide we posted this morning, and on our most recent 10-K and 10-Q.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller. Now I will turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Bob, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call this morning. I look forward to our conversation today and to seeing many of you at the EEI conference next week.\nFirst, let me start with a topic that I am certain is top of mind to all of you, which is an update on the sale of our offshore wind investment. We are very pleased to have closed the sale of our 50% stake in the uncommitted lease area to Orsted in September, along with our South Fork wind tax equity investment. We are delighted to have these transactions behind us. As for the sale of our interest in the 3 projects which are under development, we have substantially completed our contract negotiations with a buyer and continue to make good progress on this front. What remains to be completed is for the buyer and Orsted to finalize several documents such as their new joint venture agreement. We expect this process to wrap up shortly, allowing us to execute our sales agreement with the buyer and announce the terms of the sale.\nAs you see on Slide #3, I'm very happy to report that our South Fork Wind project is expected to fully go into service in early 2024. The onshore construction is complete and connected to our export cable, while offshore construction is significantly advanced with the offshore substation in array cables installed and connected. Currently, the turbine installation is underway, and we expect to have 7 to 9 turbines operationally complete by the end of this year, with the remaining turbines installed in January. This project will spearhead the U.S. offshore wind industry and will be one of the country's first utility-scale offshore wind farms built by Connecticut labor from various unions.\nOn October 31, our joint venture announced that we have taken our final investment decision, or FID, on Revolution Wind. This is an important project milestone that allows it to advance to full onshore and offshore construction and installation and have this project in service in late 2025.\nI'd like to now address the recent events in New York, which I know have been a source of great interest for many of you. On October 12, the New York Public Service Commission denied petitions or pricing adjustments from several renewable developers, including the petition for our Sunrise Wind project. The petition sought to address the extraordinary macroeconomic challenges from higher inflation and interest rates, along with supply chain disruptions that developed since our OREC agreement was executed in the fall of 2019. These factors were incorporated by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA, in their recent offshore wind solicitation.\nWhile we are disappointed with the New York PSC's decision, especially given that NYSERDA had publicly advocated for pricing adjustments, we support their commitment to transparent competitive RFP process. We are very encouraged to see that New York is working to establish an accelerated rebidding process, which includes an accelerated track where winning bids could be announced as early as next year. Together with our JV partner, Orsted, we responded to NYSERDA's request for information.\nTogether, we will work towards developing a bid that will reflect the attractive nature of this project. We feel confident that Sunrise Wind will deliver clean and reliable energy to New York and support economic development in the region, much earlier than many other projects. We will continue to evaluate ways to maximize project economics and to ensure project schedules remain on track.\nWe have begun limited onshore construction for Sunrise Wind and we have also identified solutions for our installation vessel, which many of you have been asking us about to maintain the project schedule for Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind. We expect both projects to be in service in late 2025. We're excited by the recent actions taken by the 6 regional governors who asked the Biden administration to clarify tax benefits for current U.S. offshore wind projects and provide relief on federal offshore wind lease costs as well as encouraging and accelerated permitting process for offshore wind projects.\nAnd in October, Connecticut governor, [indiscernible], announced the first of its kind partnership between Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to seek offshore wind proposals that will expand the benefits for the region and help reduce costs. All 3 states have issued RFPs to procure over 6,000 megawatts with bids due in early 2024. Eversource will play a key role in providing the transmission and distribution infrastructure investment needed to connect these important resources to our grid.\nMoving over to our core business. As you know, everything we do here at Eversource is done with a focus to continue to enhance our service for customers. As shown at the top of Slide 4, we continue to serve customers well, delivering top decile electric reliability performance at nearly 2 years between interruption in our gas, emergency response are exceeding our internal target. These high performance levels are the result of the investment we've made in our electric and gas systems over the past several years, investments focused on ensuring our system is strong and resilient and ready to adapt to the needs of our customers for years to come.\nLooking at our Clean Energy focus, we continue to move forward on enabling clean energy in our region, and we continue to make good progress in reaching our carbon neutrality goal by 2030. In Massachusetts, we are investing nearly $2 billion in our electric transmission and distribution system to advance clean energy resources.\nMoving to the bottom of Slide 4. Our customers continue to be burdened by high energy prices, particularly during peak winter months. While this winter's supply prices will be high compared to summer rates, they are expected to be significantly lower than last winters, a welcome relief for our customers. To date, Connecticut is fully procured at prices significantly lower than last year. Massachusetts is at 50%. New Hampshire is procured through January. If current market conditions continue, the expectation is that the winter supply rates in all 3 states will be much lower than last year. So prices across the region are lower than last winter.\nWe recognize that our customers are feeling the pinch of high costs in many areas. That's why we're doing what we can today to help our customers lower their bills this winter. Along with our industry-leading energy efficiency programs, we also launched a new outreach campaign in Connecticut to encourage customers to sign up with competitive suppliers to save money. We're also educating customers on new energy assistance options.\nI'm happy to report that Connecticut residential customers have responded. The share of residential customers receiving standard service from Eversource has dropped from over 90% last winter to 70% heading into this winter. To serve our customers and ensure they optimize their energy use, we continue to build out our industry-leading energy efficiency programs. In fact, Eversource ranks #1 as the best energy efficiency provider in the country.\nAs you can see on the left side of the slide, we invested over $600 million in these programs last year, avoiding lifetime greenhouse gas emissions of nearly 3 million metric tons. We'll continue to build on this great foundation moving forward.\nBy enabling energy efficiency, encouraging customers to shop for supply and educating customers on energy assistance options, we're doing what we can to lower customer bills today. Longer term, we are working with our states to provide the infrastructure investment necessary to access reliable renewable energy like offshore wind and solar generation.\nTurning to Slide 5. The shift to electric vehicles and zero carbon [ heating ] will add tremendous incremental electric demand to our grid. As you can see here, New England electric demand growth is expected to more than double by 2050, and winter peak demand is expected. This is in stock contrast to a relatively flat electric demand we've seen over the past decade.\nAlong with the rest of the utilities across the country, we are aggressively planning for the clean energy future here at Eversource. On September 1, we filed our electric sector modernization plan or ESMP. This plan is a roadmap for our partnership with Massachusetts to enable the state's clean energy climate plan. Plan details how we'll continue to maintain safe and reliable service for our customers as we transition to a decarbonized future. In addition to our base investments necessary to increase distribution system capacity, including the implementation of [ AMI ] and other technology platforms, Eversource has proposed additional investment that goes beyond the nearly $2 billion of clean energy investment in Massachusetts through 2027. This investment will go towards improving the resiliency of our system, integrating additional solar generation and implementing new technology to enable additional distributed energy resources.\nOur proposed plan is expected to exceed Massachusetts' 2040 goals and achieve 70% of the state's 2050 greenhouse gas emission goals. By requiring electric distribution companies to submit in a fully transparent manner their long-term grid modernization plans, Massachusetts is taking a leadership role in enabling decarbonization. They're not just setting policies, but tying infrastructure, clean energy and customer engagement together. We're excited to engage with environmental justice and consumer and business advocates to establish the right framework for all Massachusetts customers to advance towards the clean energy future. We look forward to engaging with all stakeholders as we work towards a final decision from the [ DPU ] later next year.\nMoving on to Connecticut. The regulatory environment remains challenging as evidenced by [indiscernible] [ United ] eliminating rate case decisions which produce returns that are value destructive for investment. But we are encouraged by the recent actions by Governor [indiscernible] supporting offshore wind investment in the region. We see the government's [ support ] as a realization that investment at a reasonable return is necessary to provide the clean energy future that our region and countries are moving toward.\nIn closing, I couldn't be prouder of the effort that the Eversource team puts in every day, providing for our customers' needs. We have the experience and the expertise to guide our customers as we develop a bold, bright energy future for New England and the Northeast. Thank you again for your time. I will now turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review our results for the third quarter of 2023 and discuss the status of our offshore wind investment and review our cash flow position. Let me start with Slide 6.\nOur GAAP and recurring earnings were both $0.97 per share in the third quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP and recurring earnings of $1 per share and $1.01 per share, respectively for the third quarter of 2022. GAAP results for 2022 include transition and transaction costs related to Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts of approximately $2.2 million. As a reminder, results for the third quarter of 2023 reflect a negative $0.08 per share impact for NSTAR Electric's rate design change, as shown on Slide 7. Adjusting the earnings for the third quarter of 2023 by this amount would result in both GAAP and recurring earnings of $1.05 per share. As I have previously mentioned, this rate design change does not impact full year results.\nMoving back to Slide 6 and looking at some additional details on the third quarter earnings by segment, starting with our Electric Transmission segment which earned $0.46 per share in the third quarter of 2023 as compared with earnings of $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2022. Improved results were driven by our continued investments in our transmission system.\nOur third quarter 2023 Electric Distribution earnings were $0.50 per share compared with earnings of $0.65 per share in the third quarter of last year. The earnings decrease is due primarily to the timing of the rate design change at NSTAR Electric that I mentioned earlier as well as higher storm-related costs, higher interest costs, depreciation and property tax expense. These factors were partially offset by higher distribution revenues at NSTAR Electric and from capital tractors that we have in place.\nOur Natural Gas Distribution segment [ lost ] $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to a loss of $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2022. The increased losses were due to higher regulatory and operating expenses, depreciation and interest expense and were partially offset by higher revenues from the base rate increases at NSTAR Gas and [ EGMA ] which took effect November 1, 2022.\nOur Water Distribution segment earned $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2023 which is the same level we earned in the third quarter of last year.\nEversource parent and other companies recurring earnings were $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2022. The improved third quarter results primarily reflect a lower effective tax rate that was partially offset by higher interest expense.\nTurning to Slide 8. Based on our financial results to date and our strong cost discipline, we are narrowing our 2023 recurring earnings projection to between $4.30 and to $4.43 per share compared with our previous range of $4.25 to $4.43 per share.\nLooking at our longer-term earnings growth rate expectation, as you saw in our news release and can see on Slide 8, we are reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate solidly in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. We are also reaffirming our $21.5 billion 5-year regulated capital program, as shown on Slide 9.\nCurrent capital expenditures totaled approximately $3.2 billion in the first 9 months of 2023. Now to further expand on what Joe covered, we reached an important milestone in our effort to exit our offshore wind business. On September 7, Eversource completed the sale of its 50% interest in the lease area that includes approximately 175,000 developable acres [indiscernible] $625 million in an all-cash deal.\nWe also closed on our tax equity investment in South Fork Wind with Orsted. We used $528 million of the proceeds from the lease area sale for our tax equity investment.\nAs a current 50% equity partner in South Fork, half of this tax equity investment or $264 million was returned to us in October we expect to recover the tax equity investment primarily in the form of tax credits once the turbines are placed in service. These tax credits will be utilized to reduce Eversource's federal income tax liability, including refunds from prior years expected over the next 12 to 18 months.\nAs Joe mentioned, we continue to make good progress on advancing the sale of our existing 50% interest in our 3 offshore wind projects. On our second quarter earnings call, I discussed one of our contingent considerations with the sale of the projects that we expected a positive outcome from the Sunrise Wind OREC reprice and petition, representing approximately $450 million in value to Eversource. Although we were very disappointed by the New York Public Service Commission's rejection of the pricing petition, we are encouraged by NYSERDA's quick reaction in its request to run an accelerated RFP process.\nAs I previously indicated, advancing the sales transaction was not contingent on a resolution of Sunrise's OREC repricing petition. As we assess our options for an OREC rebid for Sunrise, we could potentially see a scenario whereby we move forward with a sale for South Fork and Revolution Wind, followed by a transaction for the sale of Sunrise with the buyer.\nAs we navigate through this accelerated RFP process, we will continue to look at every alternative to keep the sales process moving forward in an efficient and timely manner.\nNow I'd like to update you on our expectations for qualification for the 2 additional 10% investment tax credit adders under the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA. We have previously assumed a positive outcome regarding one additional 10% adder for Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind that represented approximately $400 million in value to Eversource.\nLet me start with the energy communities. We do believe there is a good path around the prospects for qualifying for the energy communities provision of the IRA for both Sunrise and Revolution which would increase our potential ITCs to 40% of the eligible basis for these projects. Therefore, the energy community's qualification would cover this contingent value that we have recognized. Also, we will continue to explore opportunities to engage with the treasury department as they clarify the rules around the domestic content provisions of the IRA to qualify for an additional 10% investment tax credit.\nAs a reminder, the $400 million in value I just mentioned is based on achieving a single qualification outcome between either the energy communities or the domestic content adders. As assumed in our second quarter offshore wind impairment charge, we only assumed 1 additional 10% ITC adder as a contingent consideration. Should the projects qualify for both the energy communities and the domestic content adders, it would result in upside to Eversource.\nWe will continue to monitor both the RFP process and the ability to qualify for one or more of the ITC adders and evaluate their impact along with other potential impacts as part of our continual review of our impairment model. As a part of this evaluation, an important consideration will be the likelihood of success of any future bid award for Sunrise Wind from this accelerated RFP.\nTurning to cash flows. First, let me say that maintaining strong credit ratings is very important to us. Therefore, we are disappointed with the recent credit rating action taken by Moody's as the timing was a bit unfortunate. Our short-term ratings were not impacted by this action, and therefore, we should not see any impact on our commercial paper costs. As it relates to future long-term financing costs, we see potentially minimal impact. We expect our cash flows will be enhanced and more specifically, an improvement in our ratio of funds from operation relative to debt or FFO to debt. Although we expect that our 2023 FFO to debt would be a bit weak, primarily given the delay in closing the offshore wind sales transaction.\nHowever, moving forward, we expect our cash flow position to increase significantly. There are several factors we expect to contribute to enhancing our FFO to debt ratio well beyond the new threshold of 13% of FFO to debt by 2024 and beyond. A key factor driving an improvement in cash flows are the proceeds from the sale of our offshore wind projects, along with eliminating the project funding required. You may recall that as of June 30 of 2023, the carrying value of our offshore wind investment was $2.1 billion, net of the $401 million pretax impairment charge and the proceeds from the sale of the lease [indiscernible].\nWe have previously indicated that there are approximately $850 million of contingent considerations as part of the sale that is comprised of the $450 million pricing adjustment or now an RFP rebid for Sunrise OREC. If successful with the RFP award, this cash flow would be received when the transaction closes.\nIn addition, as I previously discussed, a potential $400 million from the energy communities of a 10% ITC adder qualification would be received when the projects reach COD, which we expect in 2025.\nCash flows will be further enhanced from our core regulated businesses from electric and gas distribution rate adjustments primarily in Massachusetts and other cost recovery mechanisms. We anticipate additional deferred storm cost recovery of about $400 million to $500 million rolling into rates during 2024 that will be recovered over a 5-year period. Also of note, we will fully monetize our $528 million of South Fork tax equity investment through lower tax payments and refunds which will further contribute to an improvement in our cash flow and provide the ability to pay down debt, including a portion of the $1.4 billion of parent debt maturing in 2024.\nLastly, we are committed to completing the $1 billion equity as part of our ATM program. As shown on Slide 10, we have issued no additional equity under this program through October. We also anticipate raising an additional equity through our dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs through October, and we have issued 900,000 shares under that program.\nThank you for joining us this morning, and I look forward to seeing many of you next week. I will now turn the call back over to Bob for Q&A.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nThanks, John. I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A."

My name is Emily, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]\nI'll now turn the call over to our host, Investor Relations Director, Robert Becker. Please go ahead, Robert.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Bob Becker, Eversource Energy's Director for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides we posted yesterday on our website. And as you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ and our explanation of non-GAAP measures and how they reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release, the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q. Speaking today will be Joe Nolan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Bob, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call this morning. I hope that you're all having a good summer and can take some time off after earnings season. Today, we'd like to update you on our commitment to deliver value to our customers to achieve important objectives on both ESG and diversity, and our progress to close out the offshore wind sale process.\nStarting on Slide 3. Here at Eversource, we are working tirelessly to deliver energy and clean water safely and reliably to our 4.4 million customers. Our steadfast focus on serving our customers well continues to deliver superior results in all aspects of our businesses in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\nAs you can see from the bottom of this slide, investments we have made over the past decade are greatly benefiting customers. The average months between interruption has increased significantly from 12 months in 2011 to nearly 20 months at the end of 2022, in over 2 years through the first half of 2023. As a result, this high performance level puts Eversource's reliability in the top decile compared to industry peers. In addition, when an outage occurs, the average duration experienced by customers has improved dramatically.\nOur relatively short average duration of outages also puts Eversource in the top decile compared to industry peers. This top decile level of reliability is a result of years of investment in the states in which we operate and the dedication and the high work of our skilled employees.\nTurning to Slide 4, on the energy supply side of our customer bill. We're pleased that our customers have experienced some improvement in supply pricing in New England. Challenges due to natural gas supply constraints because of the war in Ukraine and the global market dynamics led to us winter's historically high energy prices here in New England. This summer, natural gas prices have moderated nicely, and we're seeing much lower electricity prices as a result.\nIn Connecticut and Massachusetts, new supply rates went into effect on July 1 and will remain in place through the end of the year. Supply rates for residential customers in Connecticut and Massachusetts decreased approximately 40% per kilowatt hour from January of this year to July 1 of this year. In New Hampshire, residential customers will see a decline of approximately 40% per kilowatt hour in the supply rate effective August 1. As a reminder, we purchased power on behalf of our customers in accordance with guidelines set by our state regulators, and we do not earn any profit from this portion of our customers' bill.\nWe are very pleased that our customers have seen some cost relief this summer as it helps to offset customers' usage that is much higher in the summer than in the winter. And while 2023 prices have come down in recent months, we expect another seasonal increase in supply prices for this coming winter. Therefore, we remain focused on our industry-leading energy efficiency programs, and we're continuing to engage with policymakers to discuss long-term solutions.\nTo that end, in June, Senior Lead has actively participated in the FERC-sponsored Forum in Portland, Maine, on gas and electric reliability matters. The topics discussed include retaining existing natural gas infrastructure and new electric transmission infrastructure needed to connect onshore and offshore generation in other renewable energy resources. This was a very well-attended meeting that included all 4 FERC commissioners in the state energy policy leaders from across New England. We look forward to continuing the engagement with FERC and other key stakeholders to continue to advance this energy resource challenge for New England.\nTurning to Slide 5. In June, we posted on Eversource's website, our 2022 sustainability report, along with our stand-alone diversity, equity and inclusion report. These publications highlight our commitment to leading environmental, social, equity and governance practices. We continue to make strong progress towards our 2030 carbon neutrality goal with 1/4 of the emissions already cut from our baseline year of 2018.\nTo continue progressing toward this target, we're focused on 5 key sources of emissions: line loss, natural gas leaks, energy use across our facilities, fuel use by our fleet and releases of sulfur hexafluoride that is used as an insulator in electrical equipment. The many initiatives we have implemented to drive emissions down are showing results. In fact, from 2021 to 2022, we've seen a 15% overall emissions reduction. These efforts have ranged from enabling more capacity for renewables on the grid to replacing aging leak-prone natural gas pipes to investing in hybrid vehicles and procuring renewable energy for our buildings. We're also pursuing innovative solutions such as a pilot project featuring a first-of-its-kind sulfur hexafluoride-free breaker used in our electric system. And we continue to explore solutions that will enable a decarbonized heating sector. These include our geothermal pilot and evaluating the potential to replace natural gas with low or zero carbon molecules.\nAs many of you know, we're also expanding our emission reduction efforts through the commitment to adopt an ambitious science-based target. Committing to a science-based target is a best practice that places us among a handful of industry leaders in the U.S., and we plan to have our targets submitted by 2024.\nTurning now to our clean energy effort. In 2022, we invested nearly $800 million in Clean Energy, including offshore wind, battery storage, electric vehicle charging and first-of-a-kind utility scale, network, geothermal energy pilot in Massachusetts. Although we announced our plans to divest of offshore wind assets, Eversource remains committed to supporting the development of important regional Clean Energy Solutions.\nSlide 6, reflects the many clean energy initiatives underway in Massachusetts to enable the clean energy transition. As you can see on this slide, Massachusetts has a constructive regulatory framework that will facilitate over $2 billion of Clean Energy investments over the next 5 years. This includes approximately $200 million, our FERC-approved transmission projects that would enable offshore wind generation to interconnect to our grid.\nWe could potentially see an additional $350 million of transmission investment in Massachusetts issues, its next RFP for additional offshore wind generation. And certainly, we can expect this transmission interconnection need to grow as additional offshore generation is procured for the region. We continue to emphasize the need for system investments to support increased electrification and distributed generation to help ease the current reliance on natural gas generation in the region.\nHere at Eversource, while we are focused on enabling Clean Energy transition, we're also focused on enabling an equitable transition. This means protecting communities, industries and people that are at risk of being disadvantaged in the Clean Energy transition.\nNow moving to offshore wind. As you see here on Slide 7, we continue to make progress in the development of our offshore wind projects through our joint venture with Orsted. We recently achieved some major milestones with the South Fork Wind project. Construction of the project's U.S. built onshore substation and transmission cable is complete and the installation of the offshore substation and the subsea transmission cable were recently completed. Additionally, wind turbine preassembly is underway in New London, Connecticut. An installation of offshore towers will begin soon.\nSouth Fork wind is on track to become the nation's first completed utility-scale offshore wind farm in Federal waters and will soon deliver enough clean renewable energy to power nearly 70,000 homes. Also, we continue to make good progress on our Revolution Wind project. As on July 17, we received the environmental impact statement from [ BOEM ], setting the process for our record of decision and construction and operations plan approvals over the next few months.\nIn May, we announced the sale of our uncommitted lease area to Orsted for $625 million in an all-cash transaction. Last week, we received federal approval on the lease transaction clearing the way toward closing. We are now working on finalizing the transaction for the sale of our interest in the 3 development projects.\nWe have substantially completed the due diligence phase and commercial terms on this transaction. We are now truly near the goal line of wrapping up this deal. We are now working through the various agreements needed to complete this transaction and expect to make an announcement soon.\nMoving to Slide 8. As you can see here, the expected spending in in-service dates have not changed for the 3 offshore wind projects. But what has changed is that our procurement costs for the 3 projects are now at 93% as we are getting close to commencing construction activities on Revolution Wind. John will discuss the path forward toward our sale of these projects as well as some visibility on the impairment charge on the offshore wind investments.\nIn closing, as we continue our focus toward enabling a Clean Energy future our nearly 10,000 employees, and I have 1 goal in mind to serve our customers well. That means making sure we understand our customers' needs, continuing to provide reliable and safe service and making the necessary investments to deliver energy and clean water today, tomorrow and for the years to come. We've made a commitment to make the appropriate investments to enable the transition into Clean Energy future. I couldn't be prouder of the effort that the Eversource team performs every day, and I look forward to the future with great excitement.\nThank you again for your time, and I will now turn the call over to John Moreira.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our results for the second quarter of 2023, including our offshore wind impairment charge. And I'll also discuss our recent offshore lease sale transaction, give you a status update and review our 2023 financing activity.\nSo let me start with Slide 9, our GAAP earnings were $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP earnings of $0.84 in the second quarter of 2022. As we announced in May, based on our completion of the offshore wind strategic review and the status of the [indiscernible] project sale process. The results for the second quarter include an after-tax impairment charge of $0.95 per share related to Eversource Energy's total offshore wind investment. I will review details of this impairment in a few minutes.\nResults for both years include transaction and transition costs related to the acquisition of Eversource's Gas Company of Massachusetts and other charges that totaled $6.2 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2022. Absent these charges, and the offshore wind impairment, our recurring earnings were $1 per share in the second quarter of this year compared with $0.86 in the second quarter of last year.\nLooking at some additional details on second quarter recurring earnings by segment, starting with our Electric Transmission segment, which earned $0.46 per share in the second quarter of 2023 compared with earnings of $0.44 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Improved results were driven by our continued investment in Eversource's electric transmission system to maintain high reliability performance for our customers.\nOur second quarter 2023 Electric Distribution earnings were $0.47 per share compared with $0.37 in the second quarter of last year. The improved results were primarily due to higher revenues, mainly from base distribution rate increases at NSTAR Electric, an expected favorable -- unexpected favorable regulatory decision in New Hampshire that provided the recovery of previously expensed costs and lower O&M as a result of lower storm restoration costs. These benefits were partially offset by higher interest expense, depreciation and property taxes.\nOur Natural Gas Distribution segment earned $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2023 compared with earnings of $0.02 in the second quarter of last year. The improved second quarter results were due primarily to higher revenues from capital tracking mechanisms, supporting our continued investments in Massachusetts Natural Gas infrastructure as well as lower non-tracked O&M expense. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation, interest and property tax expense.\nMoving on to our Water Distribution segment that earned $0.03 per share in the second quarter of this year, really at the same level that we earned in the second quarter of last year.\nEversource parent and other companies' earnings were $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2023 compared with flat earnings in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the offshore wind impairment charge and the transaction and transition charges as I previously discussed. Improved second quarter results primarily reflect a lower effective tax rate, the residual benefit of a disposition of Eversource's interest in a Clean Energy fund, partially offset by higher interest expense.\nNow turning to Slide 10, to further expand on what Joe covered on the sale of our 50% interest in approximately 175 acres of undeveloped uncommitted lease area to Orsted for $625 million in an all-cash deal. We have executed a letter of intent with Orsted to use a portion of the proceeds from the lease area to provide tax equity to the South Fork project through a new tax equity ownership interest that we are finalizing the terms of this new agreement as we speak.\nOn July 27, we received approval from the committee on foreign investment in the U.S. or CFIUS that allows us to close on both the lease area as well as the tax equity investment in South Fork later this month or early September. As part of completing our offshore wind strategic review, Eversource evaluated its aggregate investment in the contracted projects, the uncommitted lease area and other related capitalized costs and determine that the carrying value of the offshore wind investment exceeded its carrying value. The current estimate of fair value has been based on the sale price of the uncommitted lease area, the expected sale price of Eversource's 50% interest in the 3 contracted projects based on the most recent deal pricing, investment tax credit qualifications for potential adders and the expectation of a successful repricing of the Sunrise Wind OREC contract.\nAs a result, Eversource recognized an after-tax impairment charge of $331 million or $0.95 per share in the second quarter of this year. This charge will have no -- will not have any impact on our cash flows from operations. We have made good progress on advancing the sale of our existing 50% interest in the 3 contracted offshore wind projects. As Joe mentioned, the due diligence phase is now substantially complete and behind us and we are advancing the transaction documentation. This process is complex with multiple agreements that must be completed at the same time, such as a replacement joint venture agreement.\nWe recognize this process has taken a bit longer than expected, but we are now -- but we are not going to rush through this documentation phase. It's important for us to have all agreements in a good place. With that said, we continue to remain focused on completing the final phase of this process. And once again, as Joe mentioned, we expect to announce the transaction soon. As a reminder, our total offshore wind investment after accounting for the impairment charge is approximately $2.1 billion as of June 30 of this year.\nNow turning to Slide 11. We are maintaining our full year guidance of $4.25 to $4.43 per share with a somewhat different quarterly earnings profile from 2022 due to a rate change, as I previously discussed in our first quarter call. As a reminder, the rate change -- the rate design change at NSTAR Electric became effective at the beginning of this year, which eliminated higher summertime demand charges. This change shifts $0.08 per share of after-tax revenues out of the third quarter and into the first and fourth quarter and roughly equal $0.04 per share split. There is no impact on the rate design change on the second quarter or the full year results.\nIn addition to reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate solidly in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. We also reaffirm our $21.5 billion 5-year regulated capital program that we shared during our February earnings call. Capital expenditures totaled -- has totaled about $1.98 billion in the first half of 2023.\nMoving to Slide 12. Here, we highlight several factors that we expect will contribute to an improvement in cash flows in 2023 as compared to 2022. We expect an improvement over last year's in the ratio of funds from operation relative to total debt levels. Items we are highlighting on this slide include absence of 2022 onetime cash outflow items, net proceeds from the sale of our offshore wind investment, both the projects and for lease area that will be used to lower debt balances, monetization of South Fork Wind investment tax credits, higher storm cost recoveries and distribution rate increases and the remaining equity issuance that we have discussed.\nAs you are all aware, over the past several years, we have experienced several significant storm events having an adverse impact on our cash flows, with a sizable deferred storm balance in Connecticut alone at approximately $900 million at the end of June. Our dedicated employees and the external contract, the resources we depend upon to restore service to our customers safely and efficiently, which comprise the vast majority of the level of deferred costs do an incredible job working around the clock in these severe weather events, but that does come at a cost.\nIn terms of the year-to-date financing activity, please turn to Slide 13. As you can see here in early May, we issued $1.8 billion of parent debt in 3 tranches at [ coupon rates ] ranging from 4.75% to 5.45%, and we retired $450 million of parent company debt. Our expectation is that debt issuances will be much, much lower in the second half of 2023. We have issued no additional equity under our ATM program through July of this year. We remain committed to completing the remaining $1 billion in our ATM program. In addition, we anticipate raising additional equity through our dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs used in treasury shares. And through July, we have issued 647,000 shares.\nThank you very much for joining us this morning, and I look forward to seeing many of you soon. I will now turn the call over to Bob for Q&A.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nThanks, John. I'll now turn the call back to Emily to begin Q&A."

My name is Jason, and I'll be the moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jeff Kotkin.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you very much, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted yesterday on our website. And as you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday afternoon.\nAdditional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures and how those measures reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are Jay Buth, our VP and Controller; and Bob Becker, our Director of Investor Relations.\nNow I will turn to Slide 3 and turn over the call to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call this morning. I know that you had many other choices of calls that you could have joined so I'm very grateful. We had an excellent start in 2023 as we continue to deliver safe and highly reliable service to our 4.4 million customers. Our key metrics illustrate the continued strong state of our operations. Our service reliability, as measured by months between interruptions remains in the top decile, and our safety ratings remain very strong. Our employees also performed very well and completing significant storm restoration in New Hampshire following a match Northeast that caused widespread damage and brought historic snowfall amounts that made it extremely difficult for crews to access certain regions to make repairs.\nTurning to Slide 3 in our offshore wind partnership with Orsted. We continue to advance our 3 projects through the development process.\nConstruction continues at South Fork, which will be the first large-scale offshore wind project completed in North America. Installation of the South Fork subsea transmission cable that will deliver wind power to New York is half complete and the installation of the foundations, wind turbines in offshore substation will follow. We continue to expect that South Fork will be fully operational by the end of the year.\nIn early April, the U.S. flagged Eco Edison, the first Jones Act-compliant wind farm service operation vessel reached the 50% completion milestone. This vessel, which will be based in Port Jefferson, New York will play a key role in supporting our partnership's offshore wind projects. Just a few days ago, Eversource and Orsted were joined by Rhode Island governor, Dan McKee, to announce the start of construction of our advanced foundation components for our Revolution Wind project. This $100-plus million investment is creating more than 125 union jobs for Rhode Island's skilled tradesmen and women and represents the largest supply chain commitment in Rhode Island yet.\nAlso last week, we announced with Orsted our single largest New York offshore wind industry supply chain contract with the selection of Long Island-based contractor, [ Hodlin ] Energy. This contract with Hodlin will create more than 400 jobs for New York union workers to install the underground duct bank system for Sunrise Wind's onshore transmission line in Brookhaven, on Long Island. That contract helped raise the percentage of costs locked in for our 3 projects to approximately 92%. You will see this reflected on our offshore wind project updates on Slide 4.\nYou'll notice that some of the spend has been moved from 2023 into 2024, which John will touch on in his remarks. This change does not impact the in-service dates for our projects, as you can also see here on Slide 4. We continue to make progress on the strategic review of our offshore wind investment. We have shortlisted final interested parties in both our 3 offshore wind projects in a nearly 175,000 acres of uncommitted lease areas that are part of our 50-50 joint venture with Orsted. We are making progress through extensive due diligence and continue to expect updates on an outcome of the strategic review later this quarter. Although offshore wind may not be a right fit for our portfolio of regulated T&D assets, we are big believers in the essential role offshore wind will play in bringing much needed clean energy to the New England region in lessening our reliance on natural gas for power generation.\nEversource is well positioned to be the leading electric infrastructure provider, connecting this clean energy supply to New England's load centers. We remain focused on advancing our numerous climate initiatives in support of our region's efforts to significantly reduce carbon emissions. We continue to make progress in facilitating solar development in Massachusetts, through our distributed energy resources investments at NSTAR Electric.\nAfter receiving DPU approval late last year for the first cluster of 6 capital investment projects, Regulatory proceedings for the remaining 5 clusters are now complete. We expect Massachusetts regulators to issue final orders on those 5 clusters sometime this summer. This innovative model put in place by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities with full participation of Eversource will alleviate significant distributed energy development roadblocks and is expected to lead to the addition of up to 1,000 megawatts of new solar energy capacity in Massachusetts.\nTurning to Slide 5. Design work on our geothermal network project in Framingham, Massachusetts is now complete, and construction proposals are being evaluated. We expect to commence operation in time for the 2023 winter heating season. If the pilot is determined to be successful, we intend to make it available as a clean energy solution for customers.\nLast, I'd like to provide a very positive update on the trajectory of customer bills. While the mild winter mitigated the impact on bills as a result of lower consumption, it also contributed to a significant decline in natural gas prices that is currently being reflected in natural gas customer bills. Natural gas prices also helped drive electric generation supply rates in New England and electric supply rates are expected to decline significantly in July for customers on basic or default service in Connecticut and Massachusetts.\nWe will file proposed tariffs with regulators later this month. This will be a very welcome relief for our customers following the unprecedented spike we saw in electric bills in January. Thank you again for your time. I will now turn the call over to John Moreira.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review our results for the first quarter of 2023, discuss our recent query in rate decision and review our most recent financing activity. I will start with Slide 6, our GAAP earnings were $1.41 per share in the first quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP earnings of $1.28 in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter results for 2022 include $0.02 per share impact, primarily related to the integration and transition of the acquisition of the assets of Columbia Massachusetts, now known as Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts.\nSo the $1.41 per share in the first quarter of 2023 is best compared with $1.30 per share, excluding those costs in the first quarter of last year. Looking at some additional details on the first quarter earnings by segment. Our first quarter 2023 electric distribution earnings were $0.47 per share compared with $0.41 in the first quarter of 2022. Improved results were driven largely by higher revenues at NSTAR Electric. This resulted from 2 factors, both related to the conclusion of our rate review from last year.\nThe first was a base rate increase that was effective January 1 of this year, which provided about $0.03 per share benefit in the first quarter. The second was a rate design change that also took effect January 1 of this year. This design change eliminated the higher summertime demand charge. This change will have the effect of moving about $0.08 per share of after-tax revenues out of expected third quarter results and into the first quarter and the fourth quarters of this year in roughly equal $0.04 per share split. This annual rate design change is illustrated on Slide 7.\nContinuing with the quarterly results on Slide 6. The first quarter 2023 benefits from those changes and the additional distribution revenues at Connecticut Light & Power were partially offset by higher interest costs and higher depreciation as well as pension expense. Our electric transmission segment earned $0.45 per share in the first quarter of 2023 as compared with earnings of $0.43 in the first quarter of 2022. Improved results were driven by higher level of investment in our transmission facilities. Our natural gas distribution segment earnings were $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2023 as compared with earnings of $0.47 in the first quarter of 2022.\nImproved results were due primarily to higher base distribution revenues that took effect November 1, 2022 at NSTAR Gas as well as Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts. This was partially offset by higher depreciation, interest and property tax expense related to increased investment in our natural gas delivery systems to better serve our customers. Our first quarter water distribution segment earnings were $0.01 per share lower this year as compared to the first quarter of 2022. And this is due primarily to higher operations and maintenance costs. Eversource parent and other companies after-tax losses decreased $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 as compared with the first quarter of 2022, and this is due primarily to benefit from our equity investment in a renewable energy fund, partially offset by a contribution to our charitable foundation.\nThis resulted in a $0.03 per share benefit for the quarter. Additionally, after-tax transaction and transition costs decreased by $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. Those benefits were partially offset by higher parent company interest expense for a net year-over-year improvement in the payment and other of about $0.02 per share. Overall, as you can see on our income statement, we have managed our O&M quite well in the quarter despite the storm events we experienced in March and slightly higher pension costs.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We have -- excuse me, we are maintaining our full year guidance of $4.25 to $4.43 per share with a somewhat different quarterly earnings profile as compared to 2022. Once again, we expect that NSTAR of rate design change to add about $0.04 per share to the fourth quarter earnings as it did in the first quarter of this year, but will lower the third quarter earnings by about $0.08 per share. Overall, the rate design changes will have no impact on the full year results.\nIn addition to reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of solidly in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range, we also reaffirm our 21.5 billion, 5-year regulated capital program that we discussed during our fourth quarter in February earnings call. Core business, our core business capital expenditures totaled approximately $790 million in the first quarter of 2023. As Joe noted earlier, we have changed the timing of some of our offshore wind construction costs. Previously, we have projected $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion of 2023 construction costs related to our share of our joint venture with Orsted. Now due to an expectation that the joint venture will be able to move approximately $1 billion of payments from late 2023, and to future periods, we are now expecting $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of offshore wind related expenditures in 2023, effectively lowering our capital projection by $500 million in 2023 and raising it by $500 million over the following years.\nOverall, we have made no change to the estimated cost of completing our 3 projects or their timetable and continue to expect South Fork to be in service later this year and for rev win and Sunrise win to enter service in 2025.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, our share of capital expenditures totaled about $200 million, putting our total offshore wind investment through March of this year at $2.16 billion. Moving to regulatory updates. For the first time in a while, we currently have no active rate reviews underway and have long-term rate plans in effect for many of our utilities. In March, we received a very disappointing decision in the Aquarion Connecticut's first rate review in about 10 years. The rate decision, which ordered a $2 million reduction to Aquarion rates was not unanimous. Two of the 3 commissioners commented that the 8.7% authorized return on equity provided a very negative signal for utility investment in Connecticut due to concerns with the legality of the decision and the negative long-term impact on customers we have appealed the decision to the Connecticut Superior Court, where a temporary stay is currently maintaining existing rates and preventing the rate reduction order by [ pure ]. The next hearing on this day is scheduled for May 15.\nWe look forward to working through the appeal process and believe we will come to a reasonable outcome that complies with the law, is good for our customers and provides us with the opportunity to recover our cost of service, including a fair return on our investments. Turning to finance and activities. Since our previous earnings call, we have issued $750 million of parent company debt and retired $450 million of parent debt just this week. As you can see from Slide 9, we have issued no additional shares through our ATM program. But through April, we distributed approximately $400,000 of treasury shares to meet our dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs.\nFinally, as some of you may know, Jeff Kotkin will be retiring from Eversource later this summer. I want to acknowledge Jeff for his many years of outstanding service to our company, the financial community and our shareholders. I have had the pleasure of working with Jeff for more than 12 years, and I am sure you will agree he always goes the extra mile. Since the first day Jeff joined the communications department at the former Northeast Utilities, nearly 38 years ago, he has been an integral part of Eversource's journey contributing to the company's growth, evolution and success amidst various challenging -- challenges over the years. Throughout it all, Jeff has delivered exceptional service to investors, been very supportive of its colleagues while providing steady guidance to senior management and our Board. It's no wonder why Jeff has been widely recognized as the best IR professional in our industry for many, many years. We are all truly thankful for his devoted service and we wish him all the best as he spends more time with his growing family, whether it be on the Connecticut shoreline or in the beaches of Hawaii.\nThank you, Jeff. And you will certainly greatly be missed.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, John.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nSenior VP & Treasurer, Eversource Energy\n\nSo with that said, I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning and looking forward to seeing many of you very, very soon. And now I'll turn the call over to Bob for Q&A.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nThanks, John. Before we start Q&A, I'll return the call to Jason to let everyone know how to enter questions. Jason?"

My name is Candice, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jeff Kotkin. Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVP of IR, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Candy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted yesterday on our website.

Also joining us today is our new Director of Investor Relations, Bob Becker.\nNow I will turn to Slide 2, and turn over the call to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call this morning. I will provide you updates on the energy supply challenges facing New England this winter and the strategic review of offshore wind investments.\nBefore turning over the call to John to review the quarter in various regulatory proceedings. But first, I will review our operating performance. We've had an excellent first 9 months of 2022 with our reliability indices remaining among the industry's best. Our safety ratings strong and our diversity and sustainability metrics looking quite favorable compared with our goals and our peers. Response time to natural gas service calls, a key safety and performance metric for our gas distribution business continues to be excellent.\nOur sustainability ratings at MSCI and Sustainalytics continue to be well within the top quartile among our peers, and we are in the final stages of reviewing how to best move forward with establishing aggressive goals for greenhouse gas reduction, including potentially setting a science-based target, something that only a handful of U.S. utilities are undertaking.\nWhile we continue to improve the service, we are delivering to our 4.4 million customers. We understand that our customers have a significant concern over this winter's energy costs. Not only are fossil fuel prices much higher than they were a year ago. Our region continues to be challenged by the combination of heavy reliance on natural gas generation and inadequate infrastructure to supply sufficient natural gas to that generation during cold winter months.\nThis winter looks particularly challenging for New England, given the disruptions in the global energy markets caused by the war in Ukraine. New England's access to reported LNG will be even more limited than in the past years. ISO New England has indicated that while our supply should be adequate in a moderate a normal winter, they may be challenged during a prolonged period of bitterly cold weather.\nLast week, I wrote to President Biden, asking him to consider a number of measures to help New England through the winter. They included emergency audits under the Federal Power Act in the Natural Gas Policy Act in emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to ensure adequate energy supplies for New England. The letter also recommended considerations of a waiver under the Jones Act to ease the obstacles that effectively prevent the shipping of LNG between U.S. ports in New England. I also asked President Biden to direct the Secretary of Energy to convene all relevant parties, to develop a plan to ensure the region is ready to meet the challenges 1 or more extreme winter weather events would present, using both the authorities available to the market participants in the federal government's emergency authorities.\nMany points in my letter were consistent with the [letter to] New England [6th] governance sent to Energy Secretary Grand Home in late July, the need for action now is compelling. Many of the solutions require advanced planning because they may require actions by regulators, finding new resources, chartering vessels and arranging for additional fuel deliveries. As a T&D utility with no generation other than 70 megawatts of solar, we are very limited in terms of how we influence the wintertime supply-demand equation.\nIn those areas, we can influence. We've done a tremendous amount. We have invested billions of dollars [hiding] our transmission and distribution systems to alleviate bottlenecks. Our nationally recognized energy efficiency programs have helped customers become more -- much more efficient with their energy consumption.\nWe offer our customers innovative payment options, including year-round budget billing options. But this winter is nevertheless promises to be expensive for those electric customers who do not lock in multiyear contracts in the past years. In New Hampshire, our standard offer, our default service rate rose in August from $0.11 to $0.22 per kilowatt hour. Similar levels are likely in Massachusetts and Connecticut beginning in January.\nFor our natural gas customers, residential heating costs in total bills will be up just over 20% on average compared with last winter, somewhat less than that in Connecticut. Well, any increases in these times is difficult for our customers, we are looking at much more significant increases a month or 2 ago before the recent pullback in natural gas prices.\nTurning to Slide 3. I will provide you with an update on our offshore wind partnership with Orsted. As you know, construction of our first project, South Fork, commenced early this year. Installation of the onshore conduit system including cable vaults in town roads and along the Long Island railroad right-of-way is nearly complete and ahead of schedule. Construction of our new onshore substation is on schedule, progressing well. It should be complete in the second quarter of 2023.\nIn water construction, we'll begin this month using horizontal directional drilling to install a conduit 80 feet below the beach that will extend offshore. The transmission cable will be installed through that conduit next year to move energy from 12 offshore wind turbines to a new substation and into the Long Island Power Grid. Installation of the largest components including the foundations, turbines and offshore substations will begin next summer off the coast of Massachusetts.\nWe also continue to progress well on our larger offshore wind projects. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a draft environmental impact statement for the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project in September. We expect the final EIS in the second quarter of 2023, and to have all permits in hand in the second half of 2023. We continue to target a 2025 in-service date.\nOn Sunrise, our largest offshore project, we filed a joint settlement in September with the New York Public Service Commission. The settlement includes proposed mitigation for certain environmental, community and construction impacts associated with constructing the project. The joint proposal was signed by the New York Department of Public Service environmental conservation, transportation and state as well as the offers of agriculture end markets in the Long Island Commercial Fisheries Association.\nWe also continue to target a 2025 in-service date for Sunrise Wind. We are also making significant progress on our strategic review. That review covers 3 projects I just mentioned which will generate approximately 1,760 megawatts once in service as well as up to 175,000 acres of offshore wind lease areas, where we and Orsted have rights to build additional offshore wind facilities.\nWe're now engaged with a number of potential buyers for our 50% ownership interest in our offshore wind joint venture. Orsted is actively supporting the process. It is very possible that we contract with 1 buyer for the 3 projects and another for the open acreage. We do not expect to have any incremental news on our strategic review before the EEI conference, but we may by year-end.\nWe remain very big fans of offshore wind and expect it to become a critical energy resource for the Northeast, particularly in the winter when wind speeds are higher and more consistent. You can see on Slide 4, how much has been awarded to date in New England and New York, and how much still needs to be secured. Contingent on the outcome of our review, I expect that our principal role in the future will be that of a regulated transmission provider integrating this valuable resource into our region's grid rather than a turbine owner.\nThanks again for your time. I will now turn the call over to John Moreira.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nTreasurer & CFO, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review our earnings results for the third quarter of 2022, discuss recent regulatory developments and review our finance and activity. I will start with Slide 5. Our GAAP earnings were $1 per share in the third quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.82 in the third quarter of 2021.\nThird quarter results in 2021 included a charge of $0.19 per share to reflect last year's settlement agreement that resolved a number of regulatory issues at Connecticut Light and Power. Both years included the impact of $0.01 per share of charges related to transaction and transition costs associated with the former Columbia Gas asset acquisition. Excluding these charges, we earned $1.01 per share in the third quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $1.02 per share in the third quarter of 2021.\nFor the first 9 months of 2022, we earned $3.13 per share on a GAAP basis compared with earnings of $2.65 per share in the first 9 months of 2021. Excluding charges related to transaction and transition and the CL&P settlement charges that we recorded last year. We earned $3.17 per share in the first 9 months of 2022 compared with earnings of $2.95 per share in the first 9 months of 2021.\nLooking at additional details on the third quarter earnings by segment, starting with our electric transmission segment, which earned $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.40 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Improved results were driven by a large level of higher investments in our transmission facilities.\nMoving on to our electric distribution segment, which earned $0.65 per share in the third quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.62 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Again, excluding the settlement charges I previously talked about. The improved earnings were driven largely by higher revenues and lower pension costs, partially offset by higher O&M, property taxes and depreciation expense.\nOur natural gas distribution segment lost $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2022 compared with a loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021. The increased losses were due to a higher nontrack O&M, property taxes, depreciation and interest costs, which was partly offset by higher revenues and lower pension costs, primarily at Yankee Gas.\nOur water segment earned $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2022, the same as the third quarter of 2021. Eversource parent and other companies lost $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.01 per share in the third quarter of 2021, excluding the transaction and transition costs that I mentioned earlier. The decline was due largely to 2 factors: higher interest expense, primarily related to new parent company issuances, which lowered the results by $0.04 per share; higher income tax expense of about $0.03 per share, which was specific to the third quarter results as this is when we finalize our annual corporate income tax returns.\nDespite the headwind from higher interest costs, we continue to project our full year 2022 earnings of between $4.04 and $4.14 per share, excluding transaction and transition costs that I spoke about earlier.\nTurning to the longer term. As you saw in our news release, and as you can see on Slide 6, we are reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate in the upper half of 5% to 7% range through 2026. We also reaffirm our $18 billion 5-year regulated capital program that we discussed during our February earnings call, including our $3.9 billion regulated capital investment projection for this year. We will provide you with an updated 5-year forecast when we report our year-end results in February.\nAs we mentioned during prior earnings calls, there continues to be an even increasing need for Eversource to make capital investments in our transmission and distribution systems that will enable our region to achieve its aggressive clean energy targets more rapidly. As a result of this strong public policy imperative and our ongoing focus on improving our systems to address agent infrastructure, we estimate that at least $3 billion of additional investments above our current $18 billion capital forecast will be required through 2026.\nIn July, we discussed the need to invest up to $500 million in our transmission system on Cape Cod to enable approximately 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind generation to be connected into the New England grid. We also noted that ongoing regulatory reviews of our advanced meter infrastructure proposals. At this time, regulators in both Connecticut and in Massachusetts are actively working through dockets, which decisions are expected later this year in Massachusetts and either at year-end or early next year in Connecticut.\nMoving to Slide 7. We want to highlight some new infrastructure needs to enable clean energy distribution resources to connect to our grid. Our proposals are currently before the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Massachusetts has very ambitious carbon reduction goals, an 85% reduction by 2050, and 2 cornerstones of efforts to achieve those reductions are embedding -- enabling offshore wind and solar generation. Joe discussed the offshore wind earlier, now on the solar front, a growing number of solar distributed energy resources are awaiting connection to the grid.\nIn certain areas of our state, particularly in Southeastern Massachusetts, we are at a standstill in connecting new solar resources because there is a very little available grid capacity. Under the current existing model, the developer whose project is the last draw triggering the need for a significant upgrade to infrastructure pays the full cost of resolving this capacity issue of bottleneck.\nWhen large T&D equipment limits are reached, the cost to resolve such bottleneck could become cost prohibitive for these developers. So the project will [not] likely move forward nor will other projects behind it, and thereby stall in the interconnection queue. That has created a backlog of construction of about 350 megawatts of distributed solar generation in the state, a figure that is growing.\nThe map on Slide 7 shows the 6 areas of Massachusetts with the greatest bottleneck. We have proposed a resolution whereby we would build out the system in advance, and recover some of the costs from solar developers as they tie their projects into the grid. Slide 9 shows the upgrades would be a combination of transmission and distribution infrastructure needs. Together, they would total about $900 million under our proposal. Developers would pick up about 1/3 of those costs over time and the associated rate base would be adjusted accordingly.\nA DPU decision on the first of the 6 projects is expected later this year, with decisions on the remaining 5 projects to follow in 2023. We view our proposal as an innovative solution to a vaccine issue that has slowed the build-out of third-party solar expansion in Massachusetts.\nOn the regulatory side, we are nearing the end of 1 general rate review with hearings on another one about to commence. A summary of these 2 cases can be found on Slide 10. Briefing in the NSTAR Electric rate review concluded late September, and a decision is expected on December 1, with new rates going into effect January 1, 2023. We feel very good about the strength of our case as well as our proposals to enable the Commonwealth's clean energy goals.\nMoving to our new rate review. On August 29, Aquarion Water connected -- of Connecticut filed its first rate review application in about 10 years. Key elements of the 3-year plan are shown on this slide. Aquarion Connecticut's case is a result of significant infrastructure, investments made over the past several years to enhance the water service reliability for its customers. Evidentiary hearings will start in about 3 weeks, and a final decision we expect in mid-March.\nTurning to recent financings. We completed our fourth green bond issuance at NSTAR Electric in September, selling $400 million of 30-year notes at 4.95%. That issuance helped pay off a similar size issuance that matured in mid-October. With that issuance now behind us, we have completed our long-term debt issuance program for the year.\nIn terms of equity issuances, as you can see on Slide 11, we have now issued about 2.2 million shares through our at-the-market program at a weighted average price of $92.31. Through October, we also have issued approximately 810,000 shares of treasury stock this year to fund our dividend reinvestment and employee equity plans. The impact of those issuances reduced EPS by approximately $0.01 per share in the quarter.\nFinally, in terms of credit metrics, as you will see shortly, when we file our 10-Q, our cash flows from operations totaled $1.7 billion in the first 9 months of 2022 compared with $1.5 billion in the first 9 months of 2021. The improvement was primarily -- this improvement was primarily driven by higher net income, higher depreciation and amortization and lower pension plan contributions since our plan is essentially fully funded as of the end of 2021.\nThank you very much for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of those on the call at our Annual EEI Finance Conference in Florida later this month. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVP of IR, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, John, and I'm going to return the call to Candice to remind you how to enter your questions. Candice?"

Thank you for attending today's Eversource Energy Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alexis, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jeff Kotkin with Eversource. You may proceed.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVP of IR, Eversource Energy\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Alexis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.\nDuring this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted yesterday on our website. And as you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday afternoon. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022.\nAdditionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures and how those measures reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Moreira, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I will turn to Slide 2 and turn over the call to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call this morning. I hope that our investors on this call are having a good summer and have plans for some time off after earnings season concludes in another couple of weeks.\nWe are enjoying a glorious summer so far in New England with many sunny days along our shoreline and our mountains. If you haven't made a track here this summer, we urge you to do so and support our hundreds of thousands of businesses.\nOver the past few weeks, with the longest sustained heat wave in Eastern Massachusetts in about a decade, our electric system has operated very well, and they have all year. Through June, the average number of months between power interruptions continues to place our reliability in the top decile of the electric industry, and our relatively short average duration of outages continues to place us in the top quartile. This is strong evidence that our investments in infrastructure to enhance reliability have been a significant benefit to our customers.\nResponse time to natural gas service calls, a key safety and performance metric for our gas distribution business, continues to be excellent.\nTurning to Slide 3. About 2 weeks ago, we posted our 2021 Sustainability Report and linked it to our diversity, equity and inclusion report. Our DEI report is new this year. Over the past year, a number of our investors requested that we provide additional transparency about our diversity, including providing more detail about statistics around hiring, promotion and retention rates, areas of our organization that are a high focus for us. We decided that the best way to provide investors and others with this information is to create a separate report that highlights the significant and increasing diversity among our employees, our management and our Board. We welcome your feedback on both the DEI in our Sustainability Reports.\nThe new Sustainability Report highlights our successful accomplishments last year in a variety of areas. We continue to enhance the report and, again, have third-party validation of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The report focuses, to a major extent, on Eversource's very significant efforts to support our state's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 85% by 2050.\nFrom a clean energy perspective, Slide 4 captures 3 of our initiatives in this area. Our battery storage project in Provincetown on Cape Cod was commissioned in the second quarter of 2022 and almost immediately showed its value when it helped a avert an outage for approximately 5,000 NSTAR Electric customers.\nWe have filed our first application under the most recent legislative authorization for regulated company solar generation investment. We are seeking approval of 3 different projects, all of which would combine solar with battery storage. They would be located in Brockton, Warrants and Yama in Eastern Massachusetts. And altogether, it's expected to cost an estimated $31 million to build.\nWe continue to progress on our unique geothermal network project that Massachusetts regulators approved in the most recent NSTAR gas rate review. The project will be located in Framingham, Massachusetts and will connect 140 apartments, homes and businesses to a geothermal system that will provide both heating and cooling. Customer receptivity to the project has been very strong, with nearly 85% of those along the route signing up for the pilot. We continue to expect the project to be operational in 2023.\nTurning to offshore wind and Slide 5. I want to update you on the progress we have made on our strategic review of our offshore wind investments. We've been working closely with Orsted on developing the marketing materials that will be disseminated to potential buyers for our 50% interest in our joint venture. We continue to target an outcome for this review by the end of this year. Thus far, we have had very high level of interest and expect a robust sales process.\nWe recently kicked off our buyer outreach and have had preliminary discussions with potential buyers and expect that process to continue. Key materials have been developed, including (inaudible), nondisclosure agreement, confidentiality memorandum, independent engineering document and other materials.\nIn the meantime, we continue to make steady progress on our 3 projects. South Walk is the first project to enter construction. We are virtually complete with the sections beneath the public roads in East Hampton, New York. We are now progressing rapidly on the onshore sections in the railroad right of way on the substation where the 130-megawatt project will connect. As a reminder, the offshore portions of Solta will be built in 2023. We continue to expect the 2 larger projects, Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, to be fully permitted in 2023 and to be in service in 2025.\nOn July 8, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Site Board issued to Revolution Wind a decision and final order approving the project and granting a license to construct and operate. As a reminder, Revolution will supply a total of 704 megawatts to Rhode Island and Connecticut and tying into the New England grid in North Kingston, Rhode Island.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, we've also made progress on the procurement side with 82% of the 3 project costs locked in, up from 80% in May.\nThe demand for offshore wind generation continues to grow in our region. Rhode Island just recently enacted legislation that requires a solicitation by October of this year for an additional 600 to 1,000 megawatts of offshore wind. Another much larger offshore wind RFP for up to approximately 4,600 megawatts was issued this week by New York. Including projects already awarded, we are now looking at approximately 18,000 megawatts of offshore wind authorizations from New York and the states of Southern New England.\nWe are confident that this level of procurement will attract wide interest in our wind investment since we continue to believe that the ocean tracks that we share with Orsted are about the most attractive in North America due to the high average wind speeds, moderate depths, proximity to load an incredibly deep public policy support.\nNew legislation that passed in Massachusetts House and Senate last week should also further support a robust sales process. As you can see on Slide 7, there were several elements in that Bill that should help solidify Massachusetts' effort to stay in the forefront of offshore wind development in the United States. They included an affirmation of the state's commitment to contract for 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by mid-2027, modification of the bidding process to encourage more competition among developers and incentives to increase the manufacturing and assembly of offshore wind components in Massachusetts.\nThere were also provisions to enhance the sale and leasing of electric vehicles in the state, build more energy storage and develop grid modernization plans that would support electrification as a key path to decarbonization. There is also a pilot program that would allow up to 10 communities in the state to restrict fossil fuel installation in new buildings. Health care and research facilities which have proliferated across Massachusetts would be exempt from the pilot, as would certain communities with housing affordability challenges.\nThanks again for your time. I will now turn over the call to John Moreira.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nTreasurer & CFO, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review our results for the second quarter of 2022, discuss recent regulatory developments and review our 2022 financing activity.\nI will start with Slide 8. Our GAAP earnings were $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.77 in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter results for both years include $0.02 per share of an after-tax cost associated with acquisitions, primarily related to the assets acquired from Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. Excluding those costs, we earned $0.86 per share in the second quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2021.\nFor the first half of 2022, we earned $2.13 per share on a GAAP basis compared with earnings of $1.83 per share in the first half of 2021. Excluding charges related to the acquisition and a Connecticut storm penalty last year, we earned $2.16 per share for the first half of 2021 compared with earnings of $1.94 per share in the first half of 2021.\nLooking at some additional details on the second quarter earnings results by segment, starting with our electric transmission segment, which earned $0.44 per share in the second quarter of 2022 compared with $0.40 per share in the second quarter of '21. Improved results were driven by a higher level of investment in our transmission facilities.\nOur electric distribution segment earned $0.37 per share in the second quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.35 per share in the quarter of 2021. Improved results here were driven largely by higher revenues, lower pension costs and storm restoration costs, partially offset by higher costs related to property taxes, depreciation and other employee-related expenses.\nOur natural gas distribution segment earnings were $2 per share in the second quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.01 in the second quarter of '21. Improved results were largely due to higher revenues and lower pension expense, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance costs, property taxes, interest expense and depreciation.\nOur water distribution segment earned $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2022, the same level as we earned in the second quarter of '21. Results for our Eversource parent and other companies improved by $1 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the acquisition and transition costs I mentioned earlier, the results include after-tax gains on clean energy investments which increased by $0.02 per share from last year's levels and were largely offset by higher interest costs on long-term and short-term debt.\nNow that we have the first half of 2022 behind us from an earnings perspective, and have a bit more line of sight on the second quarter of 2022, we have narrowed our non-GAAP earnings guidance for the full year to $4.04 to $4.14 per share from our previous range of $4 to $4.17 per share.\nBefore moving on, I'm pleased to announce that, as of the end of June, we have fully transitioned the remainder of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts business systems off of the legacy NiSource system and onto the Eversource platform. Overall, we cannot be more proud of the conversion process.\nIt has gone extremely well since we closed the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. We have converted approximately 300 business processes over to Eversource, including the most recent move on to a new customer information system.\nFeedback from both EGMA customers and employees have been very positive, and our operating and financial metrics have consistently met or exceeded our expectations. As a result, transition-related costs for this transaction will be minimal next quarter.\nWe are very appreciative of the great support we have received from the NiSource. NiSource team during this transition period.\nTurning to longer-term earnings. As you saw in our news release, and you can see on Slide 9, we are reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate in the upper half of 5% to 7% range.\nOn Slide 10, we also reaffirm our $18 billion 5-year regulated capital program that we discussed during our February earnings call, including our $3.9 billion regulated capital investment projected for this year. As Joe mentioned, we expect that by 2026, the last year of our current 5-year forecast, our incremental investments required to offset the loss of the offshore wind earnings contributions that would have been in place, we estimate that, that will be -- we required approximately $3 billion of investments. More to come on this front soon.\nIn both February and in May, we noted a couple of additional areas where we expect the need for incremental investment over our current 5-year forecast period to enhance reliability, customer experience and efficiently connect clean energy resources.\nTurning to Slide 11. We have provided a status update on AMI for both NSTAR Electric and CL&P. At this time, regulators in both Connecticut and Massachusetts are actively working through dockets, with decisions expected later this year.\nBriefing has been completed in Massachusetts, and we expect a decision towards the end of the year. In Connecticut, Pure held hearings earlier this month to address further questions that the (inaudible) imposed about an AMI rollout. We also expect Pure's AMI review to be completed by the end of the year.\nSeparately, as we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, NSTAR Electric filed an application with FERC in March on an innovative recovery structure to help promote offshore wind development off Massachusetts. The application involved Park City Wind, which is an 800-megawatt Avangrid project that was selected a couple of years ago as the winner of Connecticut's most recent offshore wind RFP.\nPark City will connect into the 345 kV system, where we are already planning some upgrades to meet rising electric load requirements.\nBy working on the 2 projects together, we were able to reduce costs for customers. In total, the incremental upgrades would be about $200 million, for which, about $150 million of it will be collected from Park City with FERC-based returns. FERC approved our application at its June meeting. We expect there will be other opportunities to emulate this type of offshore wind transmission interconnection agreement going forward.\nISO New England is already reviewing another project that expects to tie into the New England grid through Cape Cod. We have discussed previously that, including Park City, there are probably about $500 million of regulated transmission investment needs on Cape Cod to efficiently connect offshore wind that is reflected -- that is not reflected in our current $18 billion capital forecast. We expect other significant investment needs to arise in the near future in both electric distribution and transmission segments since our states view renewable power as a critical means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions related to space heating and transportation.\nOn the regulatory side, we have one general a rate review well underway and another one about to be filed. A summary of those cases is shown on Slide 12. Hearings in the NSTAR Electric rate review concluded just last week, and we will be entering the briefing phase soon with a decision expected December 1 of this year and with rates effective January 1, 2023.\nWe feel very good about the strength of our case as well as our proposals to enable the Commonwealth's clean energy goals. Briefing will take place throughout the month of September.\nOn July 1, Aquarion Water of Connecticut filed a letter of intent for its rate review in about 10 years. Key elements of the 3-year plan are shown on the slide. We expect to file the actual application in August. Aquarion Connecticut's regulatory ROE was about 7.8% during the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, and the company's infrastructure investments have significantly increased over the past several years to enable water service reliability for its customers.\nTurning to recent financings. We issued $1.5 billion to 2-year and 5-year parent debt in late June. Proceeds were used to reduce short-term debt. The relatively short average maturity of these senior notes is due to our anticipation of a successful sale of our offshore wind interest.\nIn terms of the equity issuances. As you can see on Slide 13, we launched our $1.2 billion aftermarket program in the second quarter of this year, and to date, have issued nearly 1.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $91.98.\nThrough July, we also have issued approximately 640,000 treasury shares this year to fund our dividend reinvestment and employee pension plan. We have received a number of inquiries from investors regarding our pension obligation. Let me start with an overview of our plan's performance last year.\nOur retirement plans earn approximately $1.25 billion, which amounts to a 24% return on planned investments, and we have contributed about $180 million into the plans last year. This resulted in the funded status of our pension plans increasing over the course of 2021 from about 79% to nearly 100%.\nThe impact of pension expense on our earnings is mitigated by the fact that we have adopted a smoothing of actuarial gains and losses over the average participant future years of service. It's further mitigated by our pension tractors in place at our 3 Massachusetts electric and gas distribution companies, and for our transmission segment.\nAdditionally, Much of our pension expense is capitalized into our capital projects and doesn't affect our earnings. And lastly, our qualified pension plan has been closed for new participants for well over a decade.\nLess than half of our pension expense actually affects earnings. The expense is lower this year due in large part to the strong returns we realized last year and a slightly higher discount rate. At this time, it is unclear whether pension expense will be a positive or a negative factor for our 2023 earnings. While it is unlikely that in 2022, we will -- excuse me, in 2023, we will experience the same returns as we realized in 2021, the discount rate that we will use for 2023 is expected to be significantly higher than the rate we are using currently, and that could help lower pension expense next year. As a reminder, our expected long-term rate of return assumed in our pension investments is 8.25%.\nThank you very much for joining us this morning. And now I will turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVP of IR, Eversource Energy\n\nGreat. Thank you, John. And I'm going to turn the call back to Alexis to remind you how to enter your questions. Alexis?"

Thank you for joining and being present at the Eversource Energy First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Irene, and I will be coordinating today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over to your host, Jeffrey Kotkin, Vice President for Investor Relations to begin. Jeffrey, please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVP of IR, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Irene, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.\nDuring this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted yesterday on our site. And as you can see in my slide, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from the forecast and projections. These forecasts and factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday afternoon. Additional information about various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use non-GAAP measures and how those measures reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Lembo, our Senior Strategic Advisor and outgoing CFO; and John Moreira, our Treasurer and incoming CFO. Also joining us today is Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.\nNow I will turn to Slide 2 and turn over the call to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, who is on the call this morning. It's been a very busy start of the year. So let me get right to it. First and most importantly, we have continued to deliver a very safe and reliable service to our 4.4 million customers. The average number of months between power interruptions continues to place us and our reliability in the top decile of the electric industry, and our relatively short average duration of outages continues to place us in the top quartile. We also responded promptly to damage caused by a number of Northeasters that seem to be arriving in New England every weekend from mid-January through February. Despite that inclement weather, response time to natural gas service calls, a key safety and performance metric for our gas distribution business was excellent. I'm also pleased with our continued work to support our state's efforts to significantly reduce their carbon footprint.\nOur sustainability ratings at MSCI and Sustainalytics remains among the industry's best when compared to our pay utilities. Our updated 2021 sustainability report will be published midyear along with enhanced disclosures on our diversity, equity and inclusion metrics.\nWe are also currently working to determine how an energy and water delivery company such as Eversource should address Scope 3 emissions.\nTurning to Slide 3. As many of you know, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities is conducting an in-depth inquiry into the role that gas will serve as the state moves to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 85% by 2050. In March, we submitted a lengthy filing in support of the DPUs inquiry. That filing has been posted on our investor website, and its key elements are included on this slide.\nAs you can see, reducing energy demand by vigorously pursuing energy efficiency in both the electric and natural gas business is a cornerstone of our strategy. Additionally, we are recommending pursuing multiple options to reduce carbon emissions from our approximately 650,000 natural gas customers in Massachusetts. They include developing a hybrid electrification pilot in a community where we share both electric and natural gas customers; building on the networked geothermal pilot we announced earlier this year in Framingham, Massachusetts; initiating a renewable natural gas program through purchases in in-state on-system injection; and piloting the potential use of hydrogen with certain commercial and industrial customers. There is no question that our natural gas distribution infrastructure will play a critical role in ensuring a successful transition to the state's clean energy future. The DPU is targeting a decision in this inquiry later this year.\nTurning to offshore wind in Slide 4. I'm sure most of those on this call have read our news release last night announcing that we have commenced a strategic review of our offshore wind investments, where we are partnering with Ørsted. It is clear that the landscape for offshore wind continues to evolve in many energy and infrastructure firms and investors, both inside and outside North America, are extremely interested in investing in the Northeast United States offshore wind market. The extremely strong prices paid for New York bight leases in February attest to this. We plan to evaluate our 50% interest in our partnership with Ørsted, together with the significant investment requirements we have ahead of us for our regulated energy and water delivery systems.\nWe have more than $18 billion 5-year regulated capital investment program that needs to be financed and additional capital projects that are likely to arise in the coming years. We have concluded that now is an appropriate time to explore monetization of our offshore wind investments. The strategic review we have launched was formally endorsed yesterday by the Eversource Board of Trustees. It could result in potential sale of all or part of our offshore wind interest. We fully expect that given the strong interest for offshore wind assets, we will be able to replace the offshore wind earnings per share that we would realize after our 2 larger projects reach commercial operation. This could result from either greater levels of regulated investment less financing needs or a combination of the 2.\nFinally, I just want to thank Phil for his decades of service to our company and our customers. I have worked with Phil for more than 30 years, playing on a softball team with him back in my early years, and he will be greatly missed. He has been a proven leader and a consummate financial professional. He has been our CFO for the past 6 years and has steered us through acquisitions, significant equity issuances in a pandemic, while being transparent with the Street, supportive of his staff and wise in his counsel to senior management and the Board. One can readily understand why our investors have rated Phil one of the top CFOs in the industry the past few years. I am truly thankful that he is remaining in a senior strategic adviser role with us for the near term to help us with this evaluation of our offshore wind investments.\nWe do not have a specific timeline for the review of our offshore wind project. During this process, we will continue to focus on a successful execution of our 3 offshore wind projects, and we'll continue to lead the onshore portion of the project during siting and construction. One key element that may amplify market interest in our 50% interest is the strong national and regional policy support for offshore wind. The current administration has targeted 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind in the Atlantic by 2030. In the 4 states that are the most likely biased of energy generated by offshore tracks continue to ratchet up their support for this clean energy source. We strongly believe that offshore wind will play a very important role in Southern New England and New York's aggressive decarbonization efforts, and Ørsted is a recognized world leader in engineering, constructing and operating offshore wind. Moreover, the sites we are developing are among the best in North America in terms of consistent wind speeds.\nMoreover, we have moderate water depths in the proximity to the electric load. In terms of our active projects, as illustrated on Slide 4, onshore cable installations beneath the roads of East Hampton on Long Island is largely complete, ahead of schedule. Major offshore work will take place in 2023, and we'll continue the project bringing a 130-megawatt, 12-turbine project into service by the end of next year, siting and permitting on our 2 larger projects, Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, also continues to progress. We continue to expect to receive final federal and state approvals in 2023 and bring both projects into service in 2025.\nSlide 6 shows that there have been no changes to the cost estimates or schedules we discussed during our year-end earnings call in February. With contracts now essentially fully secured for South Fork. We continue to focus on negotiating contracts for the 2 larger projects, which we expect to be built in 2024 and 2025. In aggregate, about 80% of these project costs are now locked in. We are making good progress on procuring additional agreements and expect that, that percentage to rise over the balance of the year.\nI want to add how thrilled I am that yesterday, our Board elected John Moreira, to be our new CFO. John will hit the ground running, having a leadership position throughout the finance organization over the past 2 decades, including treasury, accounting, budgeting, regulatory and Investor Relations. He has also headed up our Investor Relations and our strategic initiatives, including our water acquisitions in the offshore wind business review we announced yesterday. He knows Eversource inside and out, and will provide us with experienced financial leadership as we invest on behalf of our customers.\nThanks again for your time. I will now turn it over to Phil.\n\nPhil Lembo\n\nThanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover the results for the first quarter of 2022, and then John will discuss recent regulatory developments and our 2022 financing activities.\nSo I'll start with Slide 7. Our GAAP earnings were $1.28 per share in the first quarter of 2022, and this compares to earnings of $1.06 in the first quarter of 2021. The first quarter results for both years include $0.02 per share of after-tax costs associated with acquisitions, primarily related to the assets acquired from the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts deal. Results in the first quarter of 2021 also include a charge of $0.07 per share related to our performance in August of 2020 following tropical storm Isaias. Excluding the acquisition and the transition costs in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 as well as the storm-related charge in 2021. We earned $1.30 per share in the first quarter of 2022, compared with $1.15 in the same quarter of 2021.\nOur first quarter electric distribution earnings were $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2022, compared with earnings of $0.34 in the first quarter of 2021. This was largely -- this excludes the storm charge. Improved results were driven largely by higher revenues in New Hampshire and Massachusetts and lower pension costs. Our electric transmission segment earned $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2022 compared with earnings of $0.39 in the first quarter of 2021. Improved results were driven by a higher level of investments in our transmission facilities that we use to provide safe and reliable service. Our natural gas distribution segment earnings were $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2022, compared with earnings of $0.43 in the first quarter of 2021. Improved results were due primarily to higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in O&M costs.\nOur water distribution segment earned $0.01 per share in the first quarters of both 2022 and 2021. You may recall that the winter quarter is the weakest of the year for water utilities in the Northern U.S.\nEversource parent and other companies lost $0.02 per share in the first quarters of both 2022 and 2021, and this is excluding the acquisition and transition costs I mentioned earlier.\nWe are encouraged with the positive first quarter results, but believe it is a bit too early in the year to revisit our $4 to $4.17 per share EPS range. We will continuously evaluate this guidance range as we move through the year as we would typically do in past years.\nI think it's important to keep a few things in mind. A significant percentage of our incremental gas business earnings come in the first quarter. Also, we expect to commence our ATM equity issuance during the second quarter, depending on market conditions. Like everyone else, we're seeing a dramatic increase in borrowing rates. Short-term rates are up 75 basis points depending on the day. The tenure is nearly double where it was a year ago. So rates are higher, and storm response and restoration costs are a significant O&M item for the company each year. With 3 quarters of the year still ahead, we believe it's appropriate to see how the year progresses.\nBefore turning the call to John, I'll just discuss our capital plan. I want to touch on a few of Eversource's initiatives. First, Eversource Gas of Massachusetts, or EGMA. The process for transitioning EGMA into Eversource business systems is nearly complete, and we expect charges through the transition to tail off after the second quarter of 2022. Systems have been transitioned since the start of 2022, including multiple work management systems, natural gas dispatch system, GIS and skater systems and a new customer information system. This has been just a great effort by the entire Eversource team to get all 300 business processes transitioned over from NiSource to Eversource quickly and effectively over the past 18 months.\nSecond, Aquarion Water continues to grow. Earlier this year, Aquarion announced an agreement to purchase a 10,000-customer water system that serves 5 communities in Northwestern Connecticut. The transaction would result in Torrington Water holders receiving approximately 900,000 Eversource shares in exchange for their Torrington stock. Torrington is a very well-run water delivery system, whose service territory is highly complementary to Aquarion's existing footprint. Assuming timely regulatory approvals, we expect to close the transaction by the end of this year and for it to be accretive in 2023.\nI'm going to turn over the call to John in a moment, but first, I wanted to say how grateful I am for all the relationships I've had with members of the financial community during my career. This has been especially true over the past 6 years when I was fortunate enough to serve as Eversource's CFO. Our customer -- our company is in a strong financial position in a great part because of your confidence in us. I look forward over the coming months to helping Joe and other members of the Eversource leadership team in execute a strategic review of our offshore wind investments. So thank you all.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn M. Moreira\n\nTreasurer & CFO, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Phil. And congratulations on your retirement, and I personally want to thank you for your leadership of the finance team and for your mentoring of me over the past couple of decades. I also want to thank Joe, Jim Judge and the entire Eversource Board of Trustees for entrusting me with the CFO position. I'm honored by the confidence you have shown in me and look forward to supporting Eversource Energy's leading efforts to serve our customers and prepare for New England's clean energy future.\nAs you saw in our news release and can see on Slide 8, we are reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate in the upper half of 5% to 7% range.\nOn Slide 9, we also reaffirm the $18 billion 5-year regulated capital program that we disclosed during our February earnings call, including our $3.9 billion regulated capital investment projection for this year alone. You will recall that in February, we noted a couple of additional areas where we may see incremental regulated investment over the next 5 years.\nDuring -- turning to Slide 10, we have provided status updates on our AMI program for both NSTAR Electric and Connecticut Light & Power. At this time, regulators in both Connecticut and in Massachusetts are actively working through dockets, with discussions -- a decision expected later this year. Briefing has been completed in Connecticut and is scheduled to wrap up in Massachusetts over the next couple of months. Separately, in March, NSTAR Electric filed an application with FERC on a new innovative recovery structure to help promote offshore wind development off of the coast of Massachusetts.\nThe application references Park City Wind, which is an 800-megawatt Avangrid project that was selected as part of -- years ago -- as part of years ago, as the winner of Connecticut's most recent offshore wind RFP. Like the Vineyard Wind project, Park City Wind will connect to the New England grid through NSTAR Electric facilities in the Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Park City would connect into NSTAR Electric's 345 kV system where we are already planning some upgrades to meet rising electric loads. By working on the 2 projects together, we can reduce costs for customers. In addition, the incremental upgrades would be approximately $200 million, which the vast majority being collected from Park City with FERC-based returns.\nWe also have asked FERC to approve our application in an expedited fashion. We expect there will be other opportunities that will emulate this type of offshore wind transmission interconnection agreement structure going forward. Since -- together, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island are seeking approximately 9,000 megawatts of such offshore projects. On the regulatory side, our only active rate case is NSTAR Electric, and we continue to expect a decision around December 1 with new rates going into effect January 1, 2023. We are currently going through the discovery phase of this proceeding. At some point over the next couple of months, we do expect Aquarion Connecticut to file for its first rate review in about 10 years. Aquarion Connecticut regulatory ROE is about 7.7% for 2021, and well below the allowed rate of return of 9.63%.\nIn terms of financings, and recent credit rating agency decisions. We have completed a $1.3 billion 5-year and 10-year issuances at Eversource parent company. We did that in late February. Proceeds were used to meet the maturity of $750 million at the parent company that matured in March, and with the balance of the proceeds being used to reduce short-term debt.\nFitch has completed its annual review of Eversource system of companies last month and raised its outlook on CL&P from negative to stable. The stable outlooks -- also Fitch reaffirmed the stable outlook for all of our family of companies. We have recently conducted our planned meetings with Moody's and S&P as well, and brief them on the status of our offshore wind initiative, our 5-year financial projections and our equity needs. We look forward to the conclusion of these reviews later this year.\nIn terms of upcoming equity issuances, as you can see on Slide 11, we expect to commence the issuance of new Eversource shares this quarter through our previously announced at-the-market, or ATM, program. As we said in February, we plan to issue $1.2 billion of equity through this ATM program over the next few years. Additionally, we will continue to issue treasury shares to fund our dividend reinvestment, our optional share purchase and employee stock plans. This is expected to result in approximately $120 million worth of treasury shares per year through these plans during our forecast period.\nIt is important to note that our planned issuance of $1.2 billion of equity through the ATM program and the DRIP shares issuance are not impacted by the strategic assessment of our offshore wind that we announced yesterday. At this stage of our strategic assessment is too soon to comment on how any potential sale of all or a portion of our offshore wind investment would impact our financing plans in the future.\nThank you very much for joining us this morning, and I look forward to seeing all of you very soon. I will now turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVP of IR, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, John. And I'm going to return the call to Irene, just to remind you how to enter questions. Irene?"

My name is John. I'll be your operator for today's call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nPlease note, the conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Kotkin.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVP of IR, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, John. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website. And as you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday afternoon. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures and how those measures reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory; and Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.\nNow I will turn to Slide 3 and turn over the call to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Nolan\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Eversource Energy\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Jeff. I will start with an overview of our team's 2021 operating accomplishments, update you on offshore wind projects and discuss recent progress executing our clean energy strategy. I will then turn it over to Phil for a review of our financial performance and a new 5-year forecast.\nWe accomplished a great deal in 2021, as you can see on Slide 4. We had a terrific year operationally. We were able to put closure around a challenging set of regulatory proceedings in Connecticut. We made very significant progress on offshore wind projects, and we have enthusiastically engaged the entire company around our target of having operations be carbon neutral by 2030.\nTurning to Slide 5 and operations. You can see that our electric service reliability and restoration performance were top decile and top quartile, respectively. And our safety metrics as well were well above average. We continue to invest to enhance our customers' electric service reliability and the results are apparent. Even during a year when we had 20 major storm events and dozens of less severe events around our three states, we also continue to refine our emergency response efforts, which were on display again just 2.5 weeks ago, when a weekend blizzard clobbered Southeastern Massachusetts with hurricane force winds and snow depths up to 2.5 feet. Thousands of our employees and contractors worked through biting cold to restore about 300,000 outages. Winds were still howling after the snowfall ended, but our crews were able to get our customers back online within two days. Most of our storm damage was tree-related. We continue to work closely with our regulators in the communities we serve to ensure that we are installing more resilient equipment on our system in addressing the heavy vegetation along our roadways. We are committed to making the important investments needed to maintain high levels of electric service reliability and providing the grid resiliency needed to support our region's aggressive clean energy goals. In addition, we continue to accelerate the replacement of our most leak prone natural gas and water infrastructure.\nTurning to Slide 6. You can see that despite strong results, we, like many of the high-performing utilities, underperformed both our peers and the broader markets in 2021 from a total return standpoint. This comes after some very strong years of relative outperformance by Eversource that continues to place our medium- and long-term total return significantly above the EEI Index. There are solid reasons for our strong long-term record. First, since the 2012 merger that created Eversource, we have consistently achieved short-term and long-term earnings per share growth of about 6%. Going forward, we continue to expect our regulated businesses to support EPS growth in the upper half of the range of 5% to 7%. That earnings growth has enabled us to achieve attractive long-term dividend growth as well.\nAs you can see on Slide 7, earlier this month, our Board approved a $0.14 per share increase in our annualized dividend, an increase that is consistent with our long-term growth projection. Not only is that level of dividend growth attractive to our investors, the low 60s payout ratio that it represents allows us to reinvest more than $500 million of earnings annually back into our business, reducing our incremental debt needs and supporting our strong credit rating.\nTurning to Slide 8, our offshore wind business had more positive developments over the past 13 months than we experienced over the previous 3 years combined. Last week, as you can see on the slide, New York Governor Hochul joined in breaking ground on South Fork, the first offshore wind project we are building under our 50-50 partnership with Ørsted. Land-based construction has commenced on Long Island with 130-megawatt 12 turbine project will connect into Long Island Power Authority grid, providing a greatly needed source of clean power. We expect South Fork to begin operating in late 2023 and thank the federal, state and local regulators and elected officials who have worked on the review of this project for years.\n2021 also was a pivotal year for our two much larger projects, Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind. As you can see on Slide 9, we are well into the federal and state siting process for both projects. Last year, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management set schedules for a review of those two projects which we expect will culminate in the final siting approvals in the second half of 2023. Assuming those schedules are met, we expect both projects to enter service in 2025 with Revolution Wind likely entering service first. We have made significant progress securing materials and services for our three projects. We have 80% of the cost of the portfolio locked in. It seems that every few weeks, we are announcing another contract. Many of those contracts are with domestic manufacturers and service providers that are located in states where we are contracting for our offshore wind projects.\nSlide 10 has an overview of some of the publicly announced contracts. However, over just the past few months, we have seen higher-than-planned costs for such items as offshore wind foundations, certain installation vessels and logistics as well as offshore substations. Ørsted referenced some of these cost increases during its investor call two weeks ago.\nThe pandemic and global growth in offshore wind have rapidly tightened the market and supply chain for offshore goods and services. Fortunately, we procured the largest scopes of work prior to the inflationary pressure taking hold. Our wind turbine agreement with Siemens and wind turbine installation vessel charter with Dominion Energy, which makes up a significant portion of the project's cost are two prime examples. Throughout the projects, we and our partner, Ørsted, have been successful in finding ways to offset increases with savings in other areas. I am optimistic that our teams will find additional improvement opportunities as we move forward with the projects.\nOne of our key contracts is for the Connecticut State Pier in New London. The State of Connecticut, Eversource and Ørsted are funding a $200 million project to create an important staging area for offshore wind construction, including our South Fork Wind, Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects. It is probably the best site for this work between Norfolk, Virginia and Halifax, Nova Scotia, and only 60 to 65 miles from our nearest turbine locations.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, the Connecticut Port Authority commenced onshore work last summer. And a couple of months ago, the Authority received approval from the Army Corps of Engineers for the in-water construction. We consider the New London lease to be a tremendous source of future economic development for the state of Connecticut and a key strategic advantage for our partnership. The site is quite close to our 550 square mile area where we, and Ørsted expect to build projects with at least 4,000 megawatts over the coming years. We expect to continue to seek new opportunities for our lease area off Massachusetts, while continuing to be disciplined and strategic in our bidding. In Massachusetts, Governor Baker has proposed new energy legislation that, among other items, could amend certain restrictive pricing language that contributed to having only two bidders in the state's most recent offshore wind RFP. The bill is currently in the House and is expected to move on to the Senate during the current legislative session that ends in mid-July. We will keep you apprised of its progress. Separately, as many of you are aware, the Eversource/Ørsted joint venture did not seek to be prequalified for next week's New York Bight auction. We are very comfortable with our current uncommitted acreage and think it's strategically located to provide us with a competitive advantage in future RFPs in New England and New York. Once the Bight auction is complete, our understanding is that New York likely will move swiftly to its next offshore wind RFP. Our offshore wind partnership is just one of several major initiatives we have underway to help our states combat climate change. At the same time, we are focused on reducing emissions within our own operations.\nSlide 12 notes that the five key areas where we are seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our efforts to be carbon neutral by 2030. No U.S. utility or natural gas utility has a more aggressive target date for achieving carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We are currently looking to enhance our climate leadership by taking a closer look at emissions across the value chain, including examining what a science-based target would entail for a company with our profile. This includes downstream emissions from our customers' energy use. Clearly, our energy efficiency programs offer many benefits in this regard.\nLast year, we invested approximately $600 million on initiatives that will help our customers reduce their lifetime greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 4 million tons. Our new DPU-approved, three-year energy efficiency plan will expand those efforts with a growing focus on electrification. It will provide our Massachusetts electric and natural gas customers with the tools necessary to meaningfully reduce their carbon footprint and help place the state on the path to be net GHG neutral by 2050. The $1.7 billion plan maintains our long-standing mission of helping all residents and businesses reduce their energy usage and manage energy costs and is also focused on service to customers in environmental justice communities and low and moderate income households. Through our now approved programs, we expect to electrify more than 23,000 new and existing residential households as well as more than 20 million square feet of commercial space. Separately, NSTAR Gas last month rolled out an innovative community geothermal project for Framingham, Massachusetts that was enabled in our 2020 NSTAR Gas rate decision. It is shown on Slide 13.\nWe are also preparing an integrated program to combine our opportunity to build more rate-based solar in Massachusetts with the potential to tie in storage and microgrids. We expect to file initial proposed projects with the DPU within a few months. This is part of our comprehensive climate resilience efforts that are consistent with the goals of state policy makers.\nFinally, I want to comment on our relationships in Connecticut. Compared with a year ago, I believe we are in a much better place. Our October rate settlement was approved by PURA and significant customer credits lowered CL&P customer bills in December of 2021 and January of 2022. PURA has issued final orders on storage and electric vehicle programs, which are now being launched. We sense a broad level of support for AMI as it lowers costs and improves service to customers, significantly advances the pace of integration of renewable energy resources, and enables achievement of the state's clean energy goals. We believe PURA will move forward with the docket and approve its deployment at some point later this year. Thanks again for your time. I will now turn the call over to Phil Lembo.\n\nPhilip J. Lembo\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Joe. And this morning, I'm going to cover several areas, 2021 results, our 2022 earnings guidance, an updated five-year regulated investment plan and long-term outlook, an update on some of the current regulatory proceedings and finally, additional details around our offshore wind investment plan. So, let me get started with the 2021 results on Slide 15. Our GAAP earnings for 2021 were $3.54 per share compared to $3.55 in 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2021, GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share compared with GAAP earnings of $0.79 in the fourth quarter of 2020. All those periods include acquisition costs, primarily related to our purchase in 2020 of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which we now call Eversource Gas of Massachusetts or EGMA. As I noted on our third quarter call, 2021 full year results also include charges related to the settlement agreement in Connecticut. Excluding those nonrecurring charges, we earned $3.86 per share in 2021. That's up 6% from $3.64 in 2020. For the fourth quarter, excluding these charges, we earned $0.91 per share in 2021 compared with earnings of $0.85 in the fourth quarter of 2020. To break down the earnings into segments, electric transmission earned $1.58 per share for the full year 2021 compared with earnings of $1.48 in 2020. Higher earnings resulted from continued investment in our transmission system. We invested just over $1.1 billion in our transmission facilities in 2021 and I think that's compared to just about $960 million -- $964 million, to be precise, in 2020. And the reason for that was it's mostly replacing obsolete equipment and improving reliability and resilience in the region.\nOur electric distribution segment earned $1.61 per share in [2021] (corrected by company after the call) excluding the settlement charge, this compared to $1.60 in 2020. The higher revenues were largely offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property tax and interest expense. And really, these higher expenses stem from our ongoing investments to improve service and reliability for our customers. We invested about $1.25 billion in our electric distribution system in 2021, and this is up from just under $1.2 billion in 2020.\nOur natural gas distribution segment earned $0.59 per share in 2021 compared with earnings of $0.40 in 2020. This growth was driven primarily by having a full year of EGMA earnings included in our financials in 2021, and this is compared to less than 3 months of EGMA earnings in 2020. This also includes the ongoing investment in safety and reliability of our natural gas systems where we invested about $800 million in 2021. Our water distribution segment earned $0.11 per share in 2021, and this is down $0.01 from $0.12 in 2020. The small decline primarily reflects the sale of the water delivery system around Hingham, Massachusetts that occurred in 2020. We continue to invest in clean and reliable water delivery with investments in our water segment totaling $144 million in 2021. This is up 13% from the prior year and about double from where it was when we first acquired Aquarion in 2017. Excluding acquisition-related charges, the Eversource Parent segment lost $0.03 per share in '21 compared to earnings of $0.04 in 2020. This change is largely due to a higher effective tax rate.\nOverall, as Joe covered in his remarks, we are very pleased with the strong year we had as we successfully overcame many challenges and delivered very positive results for our customers and for all of our stakeholders. From 2021 results, I'll turn to our 2022 guidance and Slide 16. We are projecting recurring earnings of between $4.00 and $4.17 per share this year, compared with $3.86 we earned in 2021. The midpoint of that range reflects a 6% increase over 2021. This range excludes the remaining costs we expect to incur as we complete the integration of EGMA operations from NiSource to Eversource systems in 2022. The primary growth drivers are our ongoing investment in our electric transmission segment, where we expect to invest approximately $1.1 billion in 2022. The higher revenues from our distribution segments much of it relates to ongoing reliability and resiliency investments with existing recovery mechanisms and a performance-based revenue adjustment at NSTAR Electric. Those higher revenues will be partially offset by anticipated increases in depreciation, property tax and interest expense related to our customer-focused investments.\nOn Slide 17, you see that we are reiterating our long-term earnings per share guidance in the upper half of the 5% to 7% growth rate from our core regulated businesses with 2021 recurring EPS of $3.86 as the base level. To be clear, this guidance excludes earnings from offshore wind projects. And on Slide 18, you can see that the primary driver of this growth is our regulated capital program, which continues to make our energy and water delivery systems safer, more reliable and more resilient for our customers. We expect to invest approximately $18.1 billion in those systems over the 5-year period of 2022 through 2026. That compares with a $17 billion investment plan we discussed with you a year ago, which was for the period of 2021 through 2025. On the distribution side, we assume that we'll invest nearly $400 million over the next five years on grid modernization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Massachusetts, which is somewhat above our recent spending levels there. We receive timely recovery of these investments with a return. In Connecticut and New Hampshire, we have not assumed any grid mod investments at this time.\nAs you can see on Slide 19, these investments in our core business are projected to produce a rate base CAGR of approximately 7.1% over the forecast period.\nSlide 20 lists the investments that are included in the five-year estimate and what remains outside of it. Note that we continue to exclude AMI from our core capital program. As Joe indicated in his remarks, dockets to implement AMI are very active in both Massachusetts and Connecticut and may be concluded later this year. However, they are not yet at the point where we should be including them in our capital forecast. Altogether, implementing AMI in the two states would require about $1 billion of investment in order to deliver long-term customer savings, enhance grid resiliency and enable clean energy benefits. Also excluded from our five-year forecast are certain transmission investment opportunities. ISO-New England studies indicate that about $500 million of onshore investment would be needed to interconnect nearly 3,000 megawatts of offshore wind through Cape Cod in the southeastern portion of our service territory. Since the nature and timing of these investments are still under evaluation, we have excluded it from our capital guidance. I should emphasize that we would expect such projects to be incremental investments in our core regulated business. They are not related to our three offshore wind projects, which, as you saw in the earlier slide, connect through New York and Rhode Island.\nSo, in addition, it is also becoming clear that significant additional transmission investment beyond the $500 million will be needed to reliably tie in the 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind that Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island are targeting. These investments will extend beyond our forecast period and such are not included. They are excluded from the forecast.\nFinishing up my discussion on the regulated business, I'll first turn to a review of our current regulatory items. As you can see on Slide 21, we continue to await FERC's ruling on several items. The first of the four complaints that were filed beginning back in 2011, challenging the return on equity authorized for all the New England electric transmission owners. The others are generic dockets, one looking at the 50 basis point RTO adder and another looking at transmission incentives. On the distribution side, we are currently operating under multiyear rate plans in most of our distribution jurisdictions, CL&P's base rate freeze was approved as part of the comprehensive settlement Joe mentioned earlier. PSNH is currently in the second year of a multiyear rate plan. Our two Massachusetts natural gas delivery utilities are operating in the early years of 8- and 10-year rate plans. Yankee Gas is nearing the 4-year mark since its most recent rate review, and we are currently evaluating when its next review will take place. Therefore, our primary rate review this year will be at NSTAR Electric in Massachusetts.\nSlide 22 covers the key elements of the review. We filed it a month ago and expect a decision around December 1, with new rates to take effect at the beginning of 2023. There are several components to the filing and a couple of the key ones are noted on the slide. So let me pause here to summarize. We expect to deliver another very positive year of performance for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders in 2022. Our long-term earnings growth continues to be in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range through 2026 from our core regulated business. Our long-term growth rate is supported by a projected rate base growth of 7.1% and we have upside opportunities in the areas of grid modernization, AMI and incremental transmission development that are not part of our current forecast. The investments I've discussed thus far have been in our regulated business.\nNow I'll turn to our offshore wind partnership with Ørsted. Joe mentioned earlier, our JV with Ørsted has signed contracts in place for about 1,760 megawatts of offshore wind, and we've locked in approximately 80% of the costs we need to bring our three projects into service. To date, we've invested about $1.2 billion in the JV, which includes some development and acquisition costs that are not directly related to the three projects. In 2022, we expect to invest an additional $900 million to $1 billion in the three projects. Over the remaining years of our forecast, we expect to invest an additional $3 billion to $3.6 billion to complete and bring into service all three projects. These estimates fully reflect certain cost increases that we've encountered over the past few months that were covered earlier in Joe's remarks, as well as our estimates of our costs going forward.\nLast year, we told investors that we would provide more visibility into our financial expectations for our offshore wind investments. So, providing you with the range of the expected investment levels over the next several years is part of that. And as we said before, the benefit on earnings before the large projects enter service in 2025 is not projected to be significant. However, assuming Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind enter service in 2025, we expect offshore wind earnings to add between 6% to 8% to the net income we expect from our core regulated business in 2026. The benefit on Eversource's cash flow beginning in 2026 is likely to be much more significant. Since Eversource is currently a cash taxpayer, and we expect to remain one, we expect to use investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes in a highly efficient and effective manner, and that's just based on today's tax code. Changes are currently being considered in Congress to spur more clean energy investment that could significantly enhance our projected cash flows and returns. Potential changes include utilization of a direct pay option; allowing an increase of tax credits to 40% for meeting certain domestic content requirements; and raising production tax credits to the ITC equivalent of 30%.\nAny of these potential changes could have significant positive implications for this business and cash flows and none of these changes is reflected in the offshore wind guidance that I noted earlier. Historically, we have guided that our offshore wind projects were expected to generate mid-teens returns based on a standard Eversource 60-40 debt/equity structure. Those returns or higher are achievable with enhanced clean energy benefits contemplated by the Build Back Better plan. But even with no changes to the current tax code, we now expect our offshore wind equity returns to be in the 11% to 13% range. So still accretive for the Eversource investor and highly supportive of our state's aggressive clean energy goals.\nSo, to summarize offshore wind, our projects are making excellent progress and continue to project in-service dates as previously forecast. We, like other developers, have very recently experienced higher costs associated with global supply chain and vendor capacity issues. But perhaps unlike most other U.S. developers, we have a very clear line of sight on 80% of our costs, and we continue to work closely with Ørsted to identify savings opportunities. Despite some higher costs, we continue to project offshore wind earnings that are higher than in our regulated businesses. So closing out today's call, I want to discuss our financing plans. As we've always done, we expect to finance our capital needs in a balanced way through a combination of internally-generated funds, new debt issuances and common equity. We intend to maintain the existing strong credit ratings that we currently have with the rating agencies. Given the level of investments contemplated in this five-year outlook, we are planning to add an incremental $500 million to our equity needs over the next several years. When we first discussed issuing equity three years ago, we outlined a multi-pronged plan to raise equity capital. The first $2 billion plan was comprised of $1.3 billion in block equity and $700 million through an At-The-Market or ATM program. Separately, we announced that we would use about $100 million a year in treasury shares rather than open market purchases to fund our dividend reinvestment and employee stock programs. So to help fund the updated investment plan and allow us to maintain our strong financial profile and credit ratings, we are now increasing the size of our expected ATM program by $500 million, so, to a total of $1.2 billion. In addition, we expect to continue to fund our dividend reinvestment and employee stock programs using treasury shares, and this is expected to be about $600 million over the next five years.\nFinally, as you can see on Slide 23, we continue to remind investors of our long track record of positive performance. This slide shows that over the decade since Eversource was created, we have consistently achieved the earnings and dividend growth we targeted even back in 2012, while achieving very strong operating performance. We also have significantly enhanced our ESG profile, which certainly ranks among the best, if not the best, in the industry. So we thank you again for joining us this morning, and I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A.\n\nJeffrey R. Kotkin\n\nVP of IR, Eversource Energy\n\nThank you, Phil. And I'm going to return it to John just to remind you how to enter questions. John?"

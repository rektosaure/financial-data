Please note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in our remarks are on an adjusted basis for our fiscal periods unless otherwise noted. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\nNow I will turn the call over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and thanks to everyone joining us today. I'm pleased to report that our business delivered solid progress in performance this quarter and throughout the year. Looking ahead, we see even more opportunities for growth across all our business units. .\nThis quarter, we achieved increases in sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, continuing our upward trajectory for the full year. Our annual growth in adjusted operating income was driven by the chicken, pork and prepared foods segment, along with notable contributions from our international business.\nIn the fourth quarter, our team executed well across our portfolio with momentum in value-added protein offerings. The Chicken segment stood out delivering $457 million in adjusted operating income, thanks to higher volumes, better operational execution and lower feed costs. These gains were partially offset by increased marketing and promotional expenses.\nWe believe there's still untapped potential in areas we can control within this business. Prepared Foods saw growth in both sales and adjusted operating income. Our production facilities made significant performance improvement through disciplined operational efficiency. Meanwhile, our innovation pipeline is evolving to better match consumer preferences and emerging trends. As a result, our Prepared Foods business is capturing more market share by volume and dollars driven by innovation and targeted mass spending that is showing measurable returns.\nIn our beef and pork segments, we are increasing yield and revenue by developing more value-added products, such as season marinated and specialty trim cuts using portions that were previously undervalued. These offerings are reaching more consumers through our branded portfolio, and we're also enhancing operational efficiencies in these areas.\nAs anticipated, the Beef segment remains our only soft spot. Cattle supplies are at record lows due to drought, potential herd rebuilding and the impact of new world crew warm in Mexico. These factors created market headwinds during the quarter. Despite these challenges, we are strengthening our fundamentals by prioritizing efficiency, reducing costs and introducing innovative products.\nThis positions us to emerge stronger and beef when market conditions improve. Looking forward, we expect cattle supplies to remain tight as we move into 2026. During this period, chicken is likely to benefit most from changing consumer preferences, both at retail and in foodservice.\n2026 presents further opportunities for our chicken business. Chicken is an affordable, high-quality protein and our innovative value-added offerings position us uniquely to serve both retail and foodservice customers amid high beef prices.\nWhile we are not satisfied with our current beef results, our diversified business model continues to build resilience and drive profitability across the company. Overall, our financial position is strong with net leverage maintained at 2.1x, a direct result of deliberate actions and disciplined capital allocation to fortify our balance sheet.\nWhile consumers remain cautious and selective with their spending, we continue to expand our market share in both volume and dollars. Protein remains a top priority for shoppers. Despite rising prices, beef, pork and chicken are clear favorites with consumers viewing protein as an essential purchase and continuing to buy meat.\nAccording to Nielsen data, food and beverage retail volume declined 1.5% over the 13 weeks ending in September. In contrast, our retail branded products grew by 2.4% in volume, significantly outperforming the broader sector. This growth was broad based, highlighted by strong performances across several key brands. Hillshire Farm increased by 10.3%. Hillshire Snack Kits grew by 12.5%. Tyson-branded frozen value-added chicken rose by 8.7% and JV Dean breakfast sausage advanced by 1.6%.\nOur ongoing investments in innovation, wider distribution and effective marketing are driving growth and keeping us competitive providing substantial opportunities for further progress. As more shoppers turn to the perimeter of the store, we are meeting their demand for fresh, high-quality options with Tyson-branded fresh chicken volume growing 7.8% during this period.\nOur retail branded products now reach nearly 72% of U.S. households a rate that exceeds both private label and other branded competitors. Although private label sales are rising, their growth comes at the expense of other brands, not Tyson, as we continue to outpace the category of both volume and performance.\nWe are committed to engaging consumers wherever they are, leveraging our brand strength to thoughtfully expand into new markets and opportunities. Our recent launch of Tyson high-protein chicken cuts each offering at least 30 grams of protein per serving, has achieved nationwide distribution.\nThis success confirms strong consumer demand for convenient protein packed options. Excitement for these products is evident across social media and at retail, reinforcing our strategy to connect our brands with consumers and deliver innovative ways to enjoy our protein-rich foods. Hillshire long trusted for lunch meat has now entered the freezer section with stuff and Chapada deli sandwiches.\nThese new additions offer consumers even more convenient, delicious and protein-rich meal solutions. We're also seeing growing interest from Gen Z shoppers in the frozen aisle. Our latest offerings are designed to meet their demand for convenience, bold flavors and high quality. Sales from our innovation pipeline has steadily increased over the past 3 years.\nOur innovation expands all brands and segments, ensuring we address both current and future consumer needs. Tyson Foods is proud to lead the industry by developing products with simpler recognizable ingredients, just like those found in your own kitchen pantry. We recently introduced our simpler product line, now available in stores nationwide.\nThe preference for healthier options is clear. Last quarter, we announced that by year-end, we will remove high fructose corn syrup, sucralose, BHA, BHT and titanium dioxide from our branded products produced in the United States. As a world-class food company and a recognized leader in protein, Tyson Foods is well positioned to meet the growing demand for high-quality protein.\nIn the fourth quarter, we welcomed Devin Cole as our new Chief Operating Officer. Devin has over 30 years of experience in food industry leadership across both retail and food service. He has a proven track record working with our largest strategic customers worldwide and most recently led our chicken and international businesses to significant improvement last year.\nNow I would like to invite Devin to share more about our segment performance.\n\nDevin Cole\n\nPresident of Global McDonald’s\n\nThank you, Donnie. I'm excited to step into the role of Chief Operating Officer. Over the past 2 months, I have taken a deep dive into our operations across the entire portfolio. my promise to you, our shareholders, is clear, we will streamline our business by reducing complexity and bureaucracy, challenging the status quo every step of the way.\nOur team is committed to delivering best-in-class performance and holding ourselves accountable to our customers' expectations. Now let's review our fourth quarter segment performance. Prepared Foods delivered a strong quarter with sales up 3% versus last year or up 5.7%, excluding the effect of the product recall, primarily driven by higher pricing because of higher raw material cost recovery while continuing to enhance our product mix.\nAdjusted operating income was also affected by the higher raw material cost and achieved a margin of 7.4% in the quarter. Despite the higher raw material costs, the full year adjusted operating income was up 1% reflecting continued progress on our multiyear plan to enhance profitability in this business.\nOur fill rates in prepared foods were the highest since 2013. This progress is a testament to the improved S&OP process and unlocked efficiencies in our plants and distribution systems. As Donnie noted, our retail businesses delivered the strongest volume and dollar sales growth of the year in Q4, according to Nielsen syndicated data, outpacing category performance in both measures.\nThis has enabled us to better serve our strategic customers with greater consistency and reliability. This momentum in 2025 lays the groundwork for an exciting 2026. We see significant opportunities ahead to drive growth and improved profits. Our conviction in the multiyear opportunity to expand profitability in Prepared Foods remains strong.\nIn Chicken, we delivered another quarter of solid top line performance with sales up 3.8% year-over-year. Volume contributed nearly all of the increase, including a notable contribution from value-added product sales, which also drove a favorable mix reflected in price.\nThis is our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth demonstrating continued demand for chicken. Quarterly adjusted operating income for the Chicken segment was $457 million, an increase of 28%, building on a strong base in Q4 of last year. Our improved performance in chicken is a reflection of executing our strategy of operational excellence, combined with a focus on innovation and customer satisfaction.\nWe recognize a continued improvement as necessary and expected. Over the last year, we grew volume, net sales and adjusted operating income. We have taken the necessary steps to stabilize the margins of a substantial portion of our portfolio by providing a high level of service during the periods of market challenges for our strategic customers.\nChicken is positioned to be the best value protein for consumers as overall food inflation remains high. In our Beef segment, we continue to focus on the controllable aspects of a challenging and dynamic market. Sales in beef increased primarily due to a higher average price per pound, reflecting ongoing healthy demand.\nWe continue to believe we may be seeing the initial stages of half for retention. Any retention is likely to further restrict cattle supply in the short run before seeing more supply as we work our way further through the cattle cycle a few years out. Adjusted operating income declined versus the year ago period as higher cattle costs outpaced the higher sales from a strong cutout in resilient demand. Despite continued headwinds, we are focused on the pieces we can control like shifting further processing volumes back into our harvest facilities and tools to increase our ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\nImport adjusted operating income increased 70 basis points or 63% fueled by network optimization and operational efficiencies, leading to the strongest fourth quarter results since 2021. Sales were down 1.7% driven by a lower number of hogs harvested during the year. The lower volume was offset by higher prices.\nThe access of raw material supply for our Prepared Foods division is a key part of our end to import strategy. We have made substantial progress in utilizing raw materials like pork bellies to support our branded bacon, ham to supply lunch meat and trimming to supply sausage.\nWe will continue to push for higher utilization as it will improve access, quality and landing cost of our raw materials. Overall, I am encouraged by the incremental steps we have taken through the year. but I'm confident that we have room to grow and improve across the operational and controllable aspects of our business in 2026.\nDespite challenging market conditions, we are driven to focus on our strategic customers and consumers while delivering value to our shareholders. With protein remaining a clear winner in the mind of consumers the diversity of our portfolio enables us to make investments by partnering with our strategic customers to drive category expansion.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Curt to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\n\nCurt T. Calaway\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Devin. For the fourth quarter, total company sales grew 4.8% to $13.9 billion compared to the prior year, led by beef with solid contributions from pork, chicken and Prepared Foods reflecting the healthy demand environment for protein. For comparative purposes, the sales increase was calculated, excluding the effect of a $355 million legal contingency reserve that was recognized in the quarter. .\nFull year 2025 sales were $54.4 billion, an increase of 3.3% compared to prior year, excluding the effect of legal contingency reserves recognized during the year. Q4 adjusted operating income was $608 million, up 19% compared to prior year, driven by growth in chicken, international and pork, which more than offset the decline in beef and Prepared Foods.\nFor the full year, adjusted operating income was $2.3 billion, an increase of 26%. Once again, the increase was driven by the record performance in chicken. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.15, up 25% versus last year, and full year adjusted EPS was $4.12, up 33% from the prior year.\nOur multi-protein multichannel portfolio, combined with our team's focus on operational execution and a dynamic macro environment continues to deliver results. Turning to our financial position. Our approach to capital allocation remains disciplined, deliberate and forward-looking. We are focused on maintaining financial strength, investing in the business and returning cash to shareholders.\nFree cash flow is critical to us, and I'm pleased with how cash has trended. Full year operating cash flow was $2.2 billion and capital expenditures were $978 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.2 billion, well ahead of dividends, which were $697 million. We ended the year with $3.7 billion in liquidity and net leverage at 2.1x an improvement of 0.5 ton compared to last year.\nIf you step back and look at our balance sheet and leverage over the last few years, we've made immense progress in strengthening our foundation. With leverage continuing to decline and cash flow remaining strong, we continued share repurchases of $154 million during the quarter, and we returned $327 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases.\nAnd for the year, we returned a total of $893 million. While dividends remain our primary way of returning cash to shareholders. At current Tyson stock valuations we believe share repurchases represent an attractive opportunity. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we prioritize financial strength, our investment-grade credit rating and cash management to drive long-term shareholder value.\nLet's take a moment to review our outlook for 2026 as our accounting cycle results in a 53-week year in fiscal 2026 as compared to a 52-week year in 2025, the 2026 outlook is based on a comparative 52-week year. We anticipate full year sales to be up 2% to 4% year-over-year. We expect a range for total company adjusted operating income to be between $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.\nWe anticipate interest expense of approximately $390 million and a tax rate of around 25%. We remain disciplined in managing cash with CapEx expected to be $700 million to $1 billion and free cash flow in the range of $800 million to $1.3 billion. Now to provide more color on our segment outlook. In Prepared Foods, we expect adjusted operating income between $950 million and $1.05 billion.\nWe expect an improved level of performance next year, as a result of improved operational discipline and strategic investment in our categories. We anticipate our adjusted operating income for chicken to be between $1.25 billion and $1.5 billion. We believe chicken will be the primary beneficiary of higher beef costs in the upcoming year.\nWe also expect our operational execution to continue to perform at a high level. Based on the continuation of current variables, of tight cattle supply conditions and the potential for her retention, we expect adjusted operating income in beef to be a loss between $600 million and $400 million.\nWe anticipate adjusted operating income report to be $150 million to $250 million based on our ample supply of hogs and with continued emphasis on the operational metrics of our business. Our international business has performed well in 2025 by managing controllable costs, maximizing efficiencies and lowering conversion costs. We expect adjusted operating income in International Other to be $100 million to $150 million. Overall, I'm confident that 2026 will be another strong year for our company. That covers our segment performance, financial highlights and outlook for 2026.\nNow I will turn the call over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks Curt. In 2025, our team delivered strong results despite navigating a dynamic and challenging market landscape. These achievements are a direct result of our collective dedication and we look forward to building on this momentum as we move into 2026.\nOur diverse portfolio, commitment to innovation, operational excellence and robust balance sheet empower us to allocate capital strategically and reinforce our leadership in the industry. We remain focused on meeting growing global demand for protein while delivering value to our customers, consumers and shareholders. I would especially like to thank our team members for all you do. Your unwavering dedication and hard work are the driving force behind our progress, propelling us towards even greater success and solidifying our reputation as a world-class food company and a leader in protein.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Jon as we begin the Q&A session.\n\nJon Kathol\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move forward to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.

For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Don.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and thank you to those joining us on the call. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our performance this quarter, and we've driven results in line with my expectations. Sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share all grew year-over-year. marking our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth across each of these key metrics.\nThis was no accident. We're driving efficiencies across all businesses while delivering growth with world-class service and value for our customers and with innovation for our consumers. Our total volume was roughly flat to last year, while Nielsen data shows that we grew retail branded volumes across Prepared Foods and Chicken. We also grew volume and dollar share in aggregate across our top 10 categories, including Tyson-branded frozen chicken, [indiscernible] Farms Snacking and Lunchmeat as well as Jimmy Dean breakfast products.\nGrowth in profitability versus last year was driven by our Prepared Foods, chicken and pork segments, each delivering double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. The only soft spot in our business is the beef segment, with cattle availability at record lows, we continue to experience industry market headwinds. But even in this difficult environment, we are improving our fundamentals with increased prioritization on efficiencies, reducing costs and bringing innovative new products to market. We are poised to capitalize on tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we believe [indiscernible] retention has likely now begun and cattle availability should improve in coming years. We continue to take meaningful steps forward in building our financial strength with net leverage improving year-over-year and sequentially, a direct result of deliberate actions and disciplined capital allocation. Simply put, our strategy is working, and we are finding ways to win in today's market.\nAs you know, consumers generally remain cautious and more selective in how they spend. Nielsen data shows food and beverage retail volume remained steady versus last year during the 13 weeks of June. However, protein continues to be the right place to play and be pork and chicken are all clear winners with consumers.\nNow let's take a closer look at our branded retail performance in Q3. Volume across these products grew 1.5%, far outpacing total food and beverage. Dollar sales grew 2%. This growth was led primarily by Tyson-branded frozen value-added chicken which saw a 10% increase in volume sales driven by our brand relaunch and strong performance. We are meeting consumers where they are.\nAnd you can see that in new innovations like our Tyson Simple Ingredient nugget, developed for those seeking high protein and simple ingredients with chicken, cheese and seasoning, a great pace without compromise. We also launched fun family-friendly products like Megadyne that are driving engagement and incremental eating occasions. Our volume share increased 130 basis points, and we're growing off a base where we are the market share leader. We're especially pleased with the momentum in our snacking portfolio, where volume grew 20% and share increased 110 basis points, led by strong performance from Hillshire Brand Snacks. Our Jimmy Dean breakfast lines and Hillshire Farm lunch meats also delivered solid volume growth in the 13-week period ending in June. Innovation, distribution gains and efficient marketing and promotional support are strengthening our brands and keeping us competitive in the marketplace. And importantly, as consumers look to the perimeter of the store, we are also offering high-quality fresh options where our Tyson-branded fresh chicken volume grew 2.3%.\nAs a world-class food company and recognized leader in protein, Tyson Foods is well positioned to meet the robust consumer demand for protein. Now let's walk through segment performance. Prepared Foods delivered a strong third quarter with adjusted operating income up more than 21% and margins expanding by 150 basis points. reflecting continued progress on our multiyear plan to enhance profitability in this business. Importantly, the segment returned to top line growth in the quarter, successfully navigating higher raw material costs and improved product mix within and across channels. Innovation and expanded distribution remain key pillars of our strategy, driving both top and bottom line growth. And as mentioned earlier, our Hillshire Snacking dips and spreads are contributing to volume and share gains at retail. We're also leveraging our brand equity to thoughtfully expand into new spaces.\nWe're launching new Hillshire Farm handhelds featuring [indiscernible] Cheese, Buffalo, chicken and Philly Cheese all designed to meet growing consumer demand for convenient high-protein options. This marks an exciting step into a new platform for the Hillshire brand and reinforces that we have our most robust innovation pipeline ever as well as our commitment to innovation across the company. Our operational execution initiatives contributed to profit growth and helped offset continued cost pressure from raw material inflation.\nWe have strengthened our S&OP process and unlocked efficiencies in our plants driving fill rates above 98% in the third quarter, the highest since 2019. This has enabled us to better serve our customers with greater consistency and reliability. These improvements have also helped by ensuring that we have the right product in the right place at the right time. We are working to culturize within Prepared Foods, the operational discipline that's critical in our other businesses. while adding new tools and analytics to eliminate inefficiencies and reduce waste. There's still more work to do, but we are encouraged by the progress and excited about the long runway for growth and profit improvement in Prepared Foods. Chicken delivered another quarter of solid top and bottom line growth, including our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth.\nValue-added volume grew at more than 3.5x the rate of total segment volume, driving a favorable mix shift that is positively impacting both sales and earnings. Adjusted operating income rose more than 12% and building on a very strong base from Q3 last year. With grain costs roughly in line with last year, profit growth this quarter came mainly from incremental efficiencies we've unlocked across our plant network.\nWe have made significant strides in transforming our chicken business over the past 2 years and haven't taken our eye off the ball in driving operational excellence. In beef, as you know, we continue to navigate the cattle cycle, cattle supply is noticeably tighter than a year ago, which significantly compressed spreads in the quarter despite resilient consumer demand. We are managing this market environment with discipline, controlling what we can across the supply chain to meet customer needs. We're also seeing benefits from the network optimization efforts that shifted further processing volumes back into our harvest facilities.\nAt the same time, we're enhancing our value-added mix with the help of new data and analytics capabilities that support smarter, faster decision-making. These steps are helping to fortify the foundation for a more resilient and agile beef business, both today and over the long term. In pork, we delivered our strongest third quarter adjusted operating income in 4 years, reflecting the purposeful actions we've taken to improve our operations.\nLike Beef, we increased our capacity utilization by optimizing our network and enhancing our value-added mix. We have improved labor and asset efficiency through operational excellence. We have built a fundamentally better pork business, and this quarter's results reflect that progress. In closing, we are executing our strategy, controlling the controllables and finding ways to win in today's market.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kurt to walk through our financial results in more detail.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Donnie. Third quarter enterprise sales grew 4% to $13.9 billion, led by beef with solid contributions from Chicken and Prepared Foods reflecting the healthy demand environment for protein. Adjusted operating income was $505 million, up 2.9% driven by strong growth in Chicken, Prepared Foods and pork, all of which helped offset the decline in beef.\nAdjusted earnings per share grew 4.6% to $0.91. And as Donnie mentioned, this is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth across sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. Our multi-protein multichannel portfolio, combined with our team's attention on operational execution and a dynamic macro environment continues to deliver results.\nTurning to the third quarter segment performance. In Prepared Foods, sales were up 3.4% versus last year, primarily driven by progress on raw material cost recovery while continuing to enhance our product mix. Adjusted operating income increased 21% and margin improved by 150 basis points versus last year. Benefits from mix as well as continued progress on our operational execution initiatives drove the increase in profitability and more than offset ongoing net raw material cost increases.\nIn Chicken, we delivered another quarter of solid top line performance with sales up 3.5% year-over-year. Volume contributed 2/3 of the increase, including a notable contribution value-added product sales which also drove a favorable mix reflected in price. Adjusted operating income increased 12% as we continue to drive efficiencies in our plants and capture the benefits of top line growth. As we discussed last quarter, we increased our brand support investment both year-over-year and sequentially to continue growing our value-added product sales.\nSales in beef increased primarily due to a higher average price per pound reflecting ongoing healthy demand. This offset lower harvest volume from an increasingly tight cattle supply. Adjusted operating income declined as spreads compressed noticeably versus last year, driven primarily by higher cattle costs. In pork, sales were roughly flat, excluding the impact of a legal contingency accrual taken in the third quarter last year. Adjusted operating income increased 64% and highlighting the benefits from network optimization and operational efficiencies, leading to the strongest third quarter results since 2021.\nTurning to our financial position. Our approach to capital allocation remains disciplined and deliberate. We are focused on maintaining financial strength, investing in the business and returning cash to shareholders. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, and capital expenditures were $691 million, resulting in free cash flow of $929 million, well ahead of year-to-date dividends which were $524 million.\nWe ended the quarter with $4 billion in liquidity and net leverage at 2.1x. We have successfully reduced net leverage by nearly a full turn over the past year, with leverage continuing to decline and cash flows remaining strong, we restarted open market share repurchases under our share repurchase program late in the quarter, the first since Q1 of 2023. In fact, we returned $201 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases this quarter. While dividends remain our primary way of returning cash to shareholders, At current valuation, we believe share repurchases represent a very attractive opportunity. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we prioritize financial strength, our investment-grade credit rating and cash management to drive long-term shareholder value. Now let's take a moment to review our updated outlook for 2025. We are raising our overall guidance based on our year-to-date performance and a solid outlook for the fourth quarter. We now anticipate full year sales to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year.\nWe are raising the midpoint and narrowing the range for total company adjusted operating income, which we expect to be between $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, delivering significant growth versus last year across the entire range. We still anticipate expense of approximately $375 million, tax rate of around 25%. We remain disciplined in managing cash with CapEx expected to be at or below and free cash flow in the range of $1 billion to $1.3 billion. Now to provide more color on our segment outlook.\nIn Prepared Foods, we expect adjusted operating income in the range of $925 million to $1 billion. Our improvement plan is delivering results and offsetting significantly higher raw material costs. We are raising our adjusted operating income guidance for chicken to $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, highlighting significant year-over-year growth of 33% at the midpoint.\nBased on year-to-date performance and the tight cattle supply conditions, we now expect adjusted operating income in beef to be between a loss of $475 million and $375 million. We are tightening the guidance report to the high end of the range, anticipating $175 million to $200 million. Our international business has performed well this year, driven by effectively managing controllable costs, maximizing efficiencies and lowering conversion costs.\nWe now expect adjusted operating income in International Other to be roughly $125 million. That covers our segment performance and financial highlights. Now I'll turn the call over to Don.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kurt. I'm pleased with what we have accomplished, driven by the dedication of our team and encouraged about our future. Our diverse protein portfolio, commitment to innovation focused on operational excellence and a healthy balance sheet continue to position us as a leader, meeting the growing market demand for protein while delivering value to our customers, consumers and shareholders. Thank you to our team members for all you do and of course, to those on the call for your ongoing support of Tyson Foods.\nNow I'll hand things back to Sean as we move to Q&A.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move forward to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instruction."

King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean. You've heard me say before that operational excellence never get sold or goes out of style, and this quarter is another proof point. Our strong results underscore the consistent execution of our strategic priorities. Our teams remain focused on execution and proactively navigating and evolving environment. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth across sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.\nSecond quarter adjusted operating income is better by more than $100 million or 27% versus last year, and our margin expanded by 70 basis points. Our Chicken, Pork and Prepared Food segments, along with international and other all delivered year-over-year adjusted operating income growth. We achieved 48% growth in adjusted earnings per share, reflecting improved operating performance and strategic execution. We improved our net leverage ratio versus last year through deliberate actions and are maintaining a healthy balance sheet, underpinned by our disciplined capital allocation. This reflects our resilience even as beef remains under pressure.\nNow let's talk about demand. As we mentioned last quarter, 71% of U.S. consumers sought to increase their protein consumption in 2024. According to an International Food Information council study, the latest power of meat report from the Food Industry Association shows that U.S. lead sales at retail hit an all-time high in 2024, with consumers making purchases more than once per week. According to the study, meat had 98% household reach and was included in nearly 90% of home cook betters. Meat is the clear protein choice recognized for nutritional value, convenience and versatility. Even with a dynamic backdrop, it is evident that consumers continue to prioritize protein especially from animal sources, underscoring robust sustain demand across the category. As a world-class food company and recognized leader in protein, Tyson is well positioned. Our multi-protein multichannel portfolio allows us to serve a wide range of protein needs across eating occasions and value tiers. Our broad portfolio of strong brands Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and Hillshire Farm bringing key differentiators in a competitive marketplace, allowing us to drive long-term value.\nNow let's walk through segment performance. Prepared Foods. Prepared Foods continues to be a high-performing and dependable driver of profitability. In the second quarter, we delivered double-digit margins expanding by 50 basis points versus the prior year. The team continues to execute with excellence on the factors within their control. We see meaningful runway to expand margins over time. Our multiyear plan focused on optimizing operations launching winning innovations and expanding distribution is on track. As a tangible example of how we are driving operational improvement, we have developed and implemented new tools that provide line and process level visibility of performance versus equipment capabilities. We have achieved measurable gains over the past year with line and labor efficiencies, increasing by 250 basis points and 280 basis points, respectively. These tools, coupled with the improved sales and operations planning process, enables smarter decisions around product scheduling and labor staffing, which in turn are improving productivity, reducing costs and supporting stronger service levels.\nAs we continue to utilize these tools and improvements across the business, we'll continue to reduce inefficiencies and drive out waste. Innovation also continues to be an area of focus where we are making progress. Our Jimmy Dean chicken biscuits recently won the 2024 [indiscernible] award for new product of the year. We are continuing to build on that success with new line extensions like the chicken, egg and cheese biscuit that newly launched this spring. Right brand continues to resonate with consumers as a leading premium bacon brand. We are now leveraging a equity to expand into smoke sausage, bringing the same trusted quality to a new category. We are also unlocking growth in our Hillshire Farm snacking portfolio as consumers, especially adults continue to seek convenient protein reach options.\nIn Chicken, we delivered our best second quarter adjusted operating income in 9 years and our second consecutive quarter of volume growth. This quarter, adjusted operating income nearly doubled compared to the same quarter last year, driven by strong operational execution across the business, including the best order fill rates we've seen in many years and lower grain cost. We continue to prioritize building long-term winning relationships with our customers, allowing us to partner in growing the category while stabilizing our earnings profile. In Beef, we're navigating a challenging environment with discipline. We are managing costs and enhancing mix toward more value-added offerings. While limited cattle availability is pressuring spreads, consumer demand has remained resilient. Our teams are executing well across procurement, production and distribution to meet customer needs and stay on track.\nTurning to Pork. We delivered our best second quarter adjusted operating income in 3 years. This reflects the strength of the improvements we have made in building a fundamentally better pork business. Operational advancements and momentum in value-added mix contributed to our results, offsetting tighter spreads. And while hog costs remain a factor, we are encouraged by a healthy demand outlook. Across all segments, we are actively monitoring the evolving macro landscape. And while we are not immune, our experience in navigating past cycles gives us confidence to respond effectively and proactively scenario plan. Our strategic priorities, operational excellence, customer and consumer obsession, data and digital delivery, capital allocation and team member development remain unchanged, and our teams are executing them with excellence.\nOver the past several quarters, we have shared our actions to optimize our plant network and those efforts are continuing to generate efficiencies while also reducing CapEx requirements. In this next phase of our optimization journey, we're taking deliberate measured steps to evolve our logistics and distribution infrastructure. These efforts are early stage but are critically important as we work toward greater long-term efficiencies. We will sell multiple smaller conventional cold storage warehouses unlocking gross proceeds in the range of $250 million to $300 million and then transition as a new anchor partner into several large-scale fully automated next-generation cold storage facilities. These facilities will reduce network complexity, streamline inventory flow and simplify processes in ways that will better position us to serve our customers smarter and faster now and into the future. This transition will be a multiyear journey, but we believe this will generate around $200 million of annual savings to align with evolving opportunities around product ingredients and quality standards.\nAs a recognized leader in protein, none of the products Tyson Foods offers through our school nutrition programs include petroleum-based synthetic diets as ingredients. Today, the vast majority of our retail branded Tyson products including our Tyson Dino Nuggets, Tyson chicken Nuggets, Tyson Chicken Bites and Jimmy Dean Maple Griddle Cake do not contain any of these types of diet and we have proactively reformulating those 2 products that do. We expect that our work to eliminate use of petroleum-based synthetic dies in production will be completed by the end of May, much sooner than the time line provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Curt to walk through our financial results in more detail.\n\nCurt T. Calaway\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Donnie. Second quarter enterprise sales were $13.1 billion, but that includes a reduction of $343 million or 2.6% related to a legal contingency accrual primarily reflected in pork. Excluding this, sales would have grown as expected year-over-year. Adjusted operating income increased by 27% and to $515 million, driven by another strong quarter of performance in chicken and solid contributions from international and other, pork and Prepared Foods, all of which helped offset the decline in beef. Adjusted earnings per share grew more than 48%. As Donnie mentioned, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth across sales, AOI and adjusted EPS. Our multi-protein multichannel portfolio, combined with our team's continued execution in a changing macro environment is delivering results.\nTurning to second quarter segment performance. In Prepared Foods, sales were in line versus last year as higher pricing was offset by softer volume. It's worth noting that pricing was up across retail and food away from home channels, a reflection of our effective brand portfolio and pass-through pricing. Adjusted operating income increased nearly 5% and margin improved 50 basis points versus last year. We continue to be more efficient with our marketing, advertising and promotional support cost as well as broader SG&A expenses. We also continue to make progress with our operational execution initiatives. These improvements, along with pricing and lapping of start-up costs last year more than offset the impact of the ongoing raw material cost increases.\nIn Chicken, we delivered our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth contributing to a 2% increase in sales. Adjusted operating income increased 95% versus last year, highlighting our best second quarter performance since fiscal 2016. Year-over-year profit growth was driven by ongoing operational improvements and the net benefit of lower grain cost. Sales in Beef increased primarily due to a higher average price per pound, reflecting ongoing healthy demand. Adjusted operating income declined driven by spread compression, emphasizing higher year-over-year cattle cost. In Pork, sales we're roughly in line versus last year, excluding the impact of the legal contingency accrual. Adjusted operating income increased 67% reflecting the strongest second quarter result in the past 3 years. Cost discipline and improvements in utilization and value-added mix more than offset tighter spreads.\nTurning to our financial position. Our capital allocation strategy is consistent and deliberate. We remain focused on maintaining financial strength, investing in the business and returning cash to shareholders. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $846 million, and capital expenditures came in at $464 million, resulting in free cash flow of $382 million. Year-to-date dividends were $349 million, we remain committed to the dividend as our primary way of returning cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3x and $3.2 billion in liquidity after paying off our $750 million term loan that was due in 2026. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we prioritize financial strength, our investment-grade credit rating and cash management to drive long-term shareholder value.\nNow let's take a moment to review our outlook for fiscal '25. Our total company guidance is unchanged. We anticipate sales to be between flat to up 1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income is expected to be between $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion representing growth across the entire range. We still anticipate interest expense of approximately $375 million and a tax rate of around 25%. We remain focused on disciplined cash management, with CapEx expected to be between $1 billion and $1.2 billion and free cash flow in the range of $1 billion to $1.6 billion. The macro environment is dynamic, affecting each of our businesses to varying degrees. But as you can see from our supplemental materials and in our press release, our segment-level adjusted operating income guidance remains unchanged as well.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Curt. In closing, I am proud of the results our team delivered this quarter and encouraged by the momentum we are building. Despite a complex and evolving macro environment, we are focused on what we can control and executing with excellence. With sustained consumer demand for protein, the strength of our iconic brands and a continued commitment to operational excellence we believe we are well positioned to drive long-term value for our shareholders through our 138,000 team members. From the front lines of our facilities to our offices around the world. Thank you. Your hard work resilience and commitment of what make our success possible. And our customers and suppliers, thank you for your continued partnership and support.\nBefore moving to Q&A, I'd like to introduce Kristina Lambert. Tyson Foods' new Chief Growth Officer. Kristina was named Executive Vice President of Strategic Initiatives and joined the Tyson Foods enterprise leadership team earlier this year. Kristina has more than 28 years of experience in the protein industry. Prior to her most recent role, Kristina led our retail frozen value-added business within the poultry organization. where she maintained full P&L responsibility, expanded our innovation pipeline and manage the relaunch of the iconic Tyson brand. Melanie Boulden, our Chief Growth Officer and former Group President of Prepared Foods is retiring from Tyson Foods. I want to thank her for the results she has delivered and the team she has built. We're sad to see you go, but we wish her the best in the future. Melanie will remain a consultant for Tyson Foods, ensuring a seamless transition with Kristina.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Sean as we open the line for your questions.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move forward to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks in the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions."

King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean. Fiscal 2025 is off to a solid start. The strong results in the first quarter increased our confidence in the year ahead, enabling us to raise our full year guidance. Our results this quarter were driven by another robust performance in chicken, highlighted by the best first quarter adjusted operating income for the segment. We delivered better-than-expected results in beef and significant improvement in profitability in international and other, while Prepared Foods continues to generate solid profits and margins.\nOur first quarter performance sets the tone for what we anticipate will be another year of growth for Tyson. This marks our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases across key metrics, including sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.\nFirst quarter adjusted operating income increased by $248 million, a remarkable 60%, while our adjusted operating income margin expanded by 170 basis points versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share grew by an impressive 65%. We ended the quarter with our net leverage ratio at 2.3x, a notable and deliberate accomplishment from 4.1x at the end of 2023. In total, our first quarter delivered the best quarterly performance in more than 2 years.\nWhile we have managed through ongoing challenges posed by the current cattle cycle. Protein remains at the forefront of consumer preferences based on both per capita consumption data and consumer surveys. While the consumer backdrop remains dynamic, one thing is clear to us. Consumers remain focused on prioritizing protein in their diets, recognizing its nutritional benefits and its role in supporting a healthy lifestyle.\nA recent study by International Food Information Council revealed that 71% of U.S. consumers in 2024 sought to increase their protein consumption. This is up from 59% in 2022. Our diversified multi-protein portfolio delivered results, with chicken helping to offset the ongoing challenges in beef. Through disciplined execution and improved operational performance, we have demonstrated the power of sticking to the fundamentals, fortifying our foundation and controlling what we can.\nTurning to cash flow and financial strength. Our first quarter stood out once again. Our disciplined approach to capital expenditures and working capital management has enabled robust cash flow, which we are deploying prudently through investment in the business and dividends. When combined with improving profitability, we sequentially lowered our net leverage ratio and took another step towards our long-term target of less than 2x. This strategy ensures we are building financial strength and reinforces our commitment to shareholders.\nNow let's take a closer look at segment performance. Prepared Foods is on track for fiscal 2025. We have built our full year improvement plan almost entirely by controlling what we can, such as optimizing our operations, expanding distribution and launching winning innovation. Operationally, we made tremendous progress on our initiatives in the first quarter by outperforming our planned throughput and yield improvements, reducing the impact of distressed inventory and lowering overhead costs. We grew share quarter-over-quarter in our core 9 categories, driven by bacon, snacking and smoked sausage.\nGrowth from innovation continues to drive momentum as well. While the timing of input cost inflation put pressure on margins in the quarter, our market performance, coupled with our improved operational execution, gives us confidence going forward. Our outlook for the year is unchanged.\nIn chicken, we achieved the best adjusted operating income of any quarter over the past 8 years. Year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income was driven in part by ongoing improvements at live and plant operations, along with lower grain cost. One core component of our strong performance has been the evolution of our commercial relationships to build long-term win-win partnerships allowing us to jointly grow the category and improve order fill rates for the second consecutive year, all while stabilizing our earnings. Our customer and consumer obsession will continue to be a cornerstone of our success as we work to exceed their expectations.\nWe have also returned to volume growth in this segment. Importantly, we grew volumes in Food Service where momentum continues to build. We feel good about our leading position in the marketplace and our ability to meet customer and consumer demand. With a healthy start to the year, we are raising our full year adjusted operating income outlook.\nIn beef, first quarter results were better than expected. We continue to align all aspects of our operations from procurement to distribution with customer and consumer demand while managing spend, enhancing yield and shifting our mix to more value-added products. Challenges from limited cattle supply remains, which, along with typical seasonality, are expected to impact the second quarter and the year. Therefore, our expectations for fiscal 2025 are unchanged for this segment.\nIn pork, performance was in line with our expectations. Higher haul costs led to compressed spreads versus last year. However, our operational improvements around yield, mix and spend continue to deliver results. As we continue through fiscal 2025, our priorities remain clear.\nFirst, we will continue our focus on cash flow and operational execution. This includes driving innovation and strengthening customer partnerships across all segments while enhancing product mix, reducing inefficiencies and expanding our market presence. Operational excellence is at the core of our strategy. We are scaling the enterprise, driving cost savings and addressing inefficiencies boldly to deliver exceptional performance. And we will continue to deliver on taking more cost out in 2025 as the year progresses.\nOur iconic brands like Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm continue to resonate with consumers, even amidst high inflation and softer category consumption. In fact, nearly 75% of U.S. households purchased a Tyson product in the past year and we see significant opportunities to grow our presence in underpenetrated segments as consumers seek to add more protein to their diets.\nDigital transformation is another key enabler. We continuously work to improve how consumers and customers discover our products by leveraging the power of generative AI. As an example, in our foodservice channel, we implemented a more intuitive browsing and search experience that delivers highly relevant content. This enhancement goes beyond influencing purchases. It offers Tyson Foods invaluable insights into the evolving needs of our customers. Capital allocation remains disciplined with a focus on sustaining free cash flow through prudent management of CapEx and working capital. Finally, our team members are our greatest asset. By fostering development and encouraging growth across the organization, we ensure that the right talent and skills are in place now and for the future.\nBefore handing things over to Curt, let me say that we are confident in our fiscal 2025 outlook and our long-term strategy, powered by the strength of our diversified multi-protein portfolio and iconic brands. Our first quarter is another indication of strong execution as we commit to controlling what is within our control as we seek to drive profitable growth over time. We continue to push ourselves to do more and to leave no stone unturned as we strive to be best-in-class operators. Through innovation, marketing and operational excellence, we are well positioned to generate shareholder value and continue our legacy as a leader in protein and a world-class food company.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Curt to review our financials in more detail.\n\nCurt T. Calaway\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Donnie. First quarter total enterprise net sales grew 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in beef, pork and chicken. Our adjusted operating income increased 60% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share grew 65%. It is important to highlight that both adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share reached their highest levels in the past 9 quarters, underscoring our team's ability to execute with discipline and deliver results in a dynamic environment.\nLooking at segment performance. In Prepared Foods, volume in our food away from home channels was relatively flat versus last year. We, like others in the industry, continue to navigate a dynamic consumer environment, which primarily impacted our retail volumes and drove the decline in sales. Adjusted operating income decreased primarily due to higher raw material costs, particularly with the sharp rise in [indiscernible] and [ sow ] prices in the quarter. We anticipate recovering some of these increases through price pass-through.\nAs Donnie mentioned, we made progress on operational improvement initiatives and we continue to repurpose inefficient marketing and promotion support cost, while lapping the impact of start-up costs last year. Chicken also continues to be a bright spot in our portfolio, with sales increasing due to higher volumes in the foodservice channel, where our value-added products are gaining traction. Adjusted operating income almost doubled year-over-year making this a record first quarter performance and the best quarterly performance in the last 8 years. This was driven by lower input costs, continued strong execution in live operations and improved plant performance.\nIn beef, revenue increased primarily from higher volume, highlighting increased carcass weights and higher head throughput. Adjusted operating income improved due to an increase in our value-added mix and an inventory valuation adjustment impacting first quarter last year.\nMeanwhile, in pork, revenue grew driven by a higher cutoff, though adjusted operating income declined due to compressed spreads partially offset by ongoing operational improvements. International and Other delivered record quarterly adjusted operating income, supported by strong results in Asia, along with favorable raw material costs.\nTurning to our financial position. Our disciplined capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on maintaining financial strength, investing in business growth and returning cash to shareholders.\nIn the first quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flows. Capital spending remained disciplined and in line with expectations at $271 million, leading to free cash flow of $760 million. We returned $175 million to shareholders through dividends, which our board increased to a quarterly rate of $0.50 per Class A share, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns.\nOur net leverage declined to 2.3x, our fifth consecutive quarter of improvement and we continued our focus on disciplined cash management. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in liquidity. Given the cash generation of our business, in January, we paid off the $750 million term loan that was due in 2026. As we prioritize financial strength, our investment-grade credit rating, and long-term shareholder value creation.\nNow let's take a moment to review our updated outlook for fiscal '25. Looking ahead, we remain confident in achieving improved financial performance compared to fiscal '24. We are raising our sales guidance and now expect to be between flat to up 1%, driven primarily by volume, highlighting healthy demand for protein. Total company adjusted operating income is now raised to be between $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, building on our strong performance in the first quarter. We anticipate interest expense of approximately $375 million and a tax rate of around 25%, while maintaining tight CapEx controls between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. As for free cash flow, we expect typical seasonality in the second quarter, and we have updated our full year free cash flow expectations to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.6 billion.\nNow to provide more color on our segments. We are maintaining Prepared Foods adjusted operating income guidance at $900 million to $1.1 billion, driven by efficiency gains. Unlike typical seasonality, we expect a more balanced first and second half, with the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year, due to timing-related factors and the ramp-up of operational improvements. As a reminder, our forecast assumes double-digit growth at the midpoint, enabled by internal initiatives without factoring in or assuming significant changes in consumer behavior.\nIn chicken, given the strong first quarter performance, we are raising adjusted operating income guidance to $1 billion to $1.3 billion, as we sustain operational improvements while reinvesting in our value-added portfolio and marketing. Our beef guidance remains unchanged with an expected loss of $400 million to $200 million, balancing operational improvements against tighter spreads throughout the remainder of the year. Our pork guidance also remains unchanged at $100 million to $200 million with ongoing operational improvements, offset by tighter spreads. Finally, our international business continues to show momentum in profitability. Following approximately $50 million of adjusted operating income last year we expect International and Other to be between $50 million and $100 million this year.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Curt. I'd like to thank our 138,000 team members across the globe for their hard work and dedication, which drives our success. I'd also like to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnership, by operating as one team, One Tyson, we're off to a great start in fiscal 2025 and have optimism for the year, highlighted by our guidance raise.\nWith increasing consumer focus on protein, combined with our market leadership, strong brand portfolio and operational discipline, we are positioned well for the future. As always, we remain committed to financial strength, shareholder returns and operational excellence [indiscernible] we execute our strategy.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Sean as we move to your questions.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move to your questions.

We delivered [indiscernible] AOI of more than $300 million, the best third quarter profit resulted in 8 years. We are raising our guidance in chicken for the third consecutive quarter. The midpoint of our outlook is now $350 million better than our initial expectations coming to the fiscal year. I want to emphasize that the operational improvements we've been driving are enabling us to benefit from the market tailwinds, invest in our value-added portfolio while also enhancing our results.\nIn fact, all of our businesses are more agile, collaborative and disciplined than they have been in some time. Beyond the strong results in chicken in Q3, pork also came in better than we anticipated, while Beef and Prepared Foods were in line with our expectations. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to improve cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow is better by more than $1.2 billion compared to last year. This growth was driven by improved profitability and our focus on managing working capital and controlling capital expenditures.\nWhile still investing for profitable growth, and again, we're delivering these results in the face of a challenging environment for Beef, better performance has helped us to reduce our net leverage ratio for the third consecutive quarter. Before I talk more about the performance in the quarter by segment, let me remind you that we have some of the most iconic retail brands in all of food with top brands and protein. Behind Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, we have the #1 or #2 market [indiscernible] strategy and optimistic about our future and the ability to drive long-term value for shareholders.\nLet's move to segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. In foodservice, we continue to broaden our core base, grow in margin-accretive channels and expand our presence in broadline distribution categories. This led to overall volume and sales growth in Q3. AOI for the quarter was right in line with our expectations. Operational execution, including supply chain improvements and more efficient and effective marketing support through digital are delivering results.\nIn addition, we are leaning into our top-performing SKUs to capture opportunities to expand distribution. While our brands remain strong, we are continually focused on new innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for our products. For instance, the Jimmy Dean [indiscernible] platform is an innovation we're very proud of. We've launched two flavors: Maple and blueberry, and we're seeing an exceptionally strong repeat rate and customer adoption, making it one of the most successful Prepared Foods innovation over the past 5 years. Our focus on execution and innovation are keeping us on track to deliver another solid performance for the year.\nAs I mentioned, chicken had one of its best quarters in some time. While we are clearly benefiting from better market conditions, including lower grain costs, our actions and focus on the fundamentals across all aspects of the value chain are also contributing to these strong results. Our live operations continue to improve with hatch rates and livability up year-over-year. We've generated efficiencies and improved utilization in our plants by optimizing our network. Our demand planning and customer service also taken significant steps forward as we improve order fill rates and continue to build long-term partnerships with customers, all while reducing inventory.\nWe've reinvested some of the proceeds from these improvements into the long-term growth of our value-added chicken business. For instance, we've accelerated the ramp-up of our Danville fully cooked facility and launch new products like Honey Bites and restaurant quality wins. In summary, our focus on the basics has built a fundamentally stronger chicken business with an eye on the future.\nMoving to beef. As expected, elevated cattle costs continue to compress spreads in fiscal Q3. While pasture conditions have improved this year, clear signs of meaningful herd rebuilding have not emerged. We continue to be laser-focused on the things we can control, such as labor utilization, yields and mix management to meet consumer demand and customer needs as we manage through the challenges of the cattle cycle.\nTurning to pork. The overall health of the herd and the productivity of sales remain strong, driving an ample supply of lean hog combined with solid demand and the benefits of our improved operational execution. AOI increased noticeably versus last year.\nNow let me take a moment to reflect on who we are. Our purpose is to feed the world like family, where protein remains clearly at the center of the plate. In fact, protein is the largest category in the retail food and beverage sector, accounting for about 1/3 of sales in the U.S. We believe protein plays a central role in any healthy diet. This is why we see consumption growth is up 1.3% across beef, chicken and pork in fiscal Q3 per Nielsen and is also when we have protein as a foundational core. Our strategy encompasses our differentiated capabilities and scale and our diverse portfolio across channels categories and eating occasions.\nOur strategic pillars are supported by key enablers of operational excellence, customer and consumer [indiscernible] along with data and digital. One key goal is building on our iconic brands to value up our core proteins. Today, Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm are 3 of the top 10 protein brands with room to expand household penetration. Brands are our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins and stronger returns and its most effective way to generate long-term shareholder value. As I've emphasized all year, our priorities are centered on controlling the controllables, including [indiscernible].\nOur cash flow performance this year demonstrates the success we've had on this front. We're also focused on operational [indiscernible] by continuously improving chicken, strengthening prepared foods, navigating be it through a difficult cattle cycle and driving efficiencies [indiscernible] we came into fiscal '24 with plans to deliver against these priorities. Our focus on being intentional and deliberate on executing those plans and delivering tangible results.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Curt to review our financial performance in more detail.\n\nCurt T. Calaway\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Donnie. Total company net sales of $13.35 billion in Q3 were up 1.6% year-over-year. The increase was led by beef with contributions from Pork and Prepared Foods, partially offset by declines in chicken and international. Adjusted operating income improved $312 million to nearly $500 million, driven primarily by another quarter of substantial increase in chicken profitability.\nOperational improvements and substantially higher AOI led to a $0.72 increase in adjusted EPS, which came in at $0.87 in Q3. As Donnie mentioned earlier, this is our best AOI, AOI margin and adjusted EPS in the past 7 quarters.\nNow let's review our segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q3 revenue grew 2.1% versus last year, driven by volume growth in foodservice. As we expected, AOI in Q3 was down modestly. Higher raw material costs were partially offset by lower MAP spend versus an elevated level last year and the benefits of operational efficiencies and top line growth.\nMoving to chicken. Sales in Q3 declined 3.2%, primarily due to the pass-through of lower input costs and pricing. While volume was roughly flat year-over-year as we continue to better align supply with customer demand, it was up approximately 2% from Q3 of fiscal '22. AOI increased $370 million versus last year to $307 million.\nLower input costs, net of pass-through pricing, along with the benefits of the strategic actions we have taken and the efficiencies the business has driven across our operations, drove the growth in AOI. We also experienced favorable year-over-year derivative impacts of $63 million, primarily related to a $65 million net derivative loss in Q3 last year.\nIn beef, revenue was up 5.8% year-over-year in the quarter, primarily due to the volume impact of higher average carcass waste with pricing increasing 1.4%. While revenue increased, AOI decreased primarily reflecting compressed spreads as expected, which more than offset our continued progress on operational efficiencies.\nMoving to pork. Q3 revenue increased a net 10.4%, driven by higher price per pound, reflecting healthy global demand. AOI also increased $92 million year-over-year, benefiting from improved spreads and better operational execution.\nShifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to disciplined capital allocation remains unchanged. Our priorities are to maintain financial strength, invest in the business and return cash to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.\nCash flow from operations remained strong with year-to-date approaching $2 billion, highlighting improved profitability and working capital management. Operating cash flows was more than double our CapEx, which came in at $884 million year-to-date. CapEx in Q3 of $263 million declined sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting our focus on controlling capital deployment while continuing to invest for profitable growth.\nYear-to-date free cash flow of $1.1 billion is more than 2.5x better than the previous 2 fiscal years combined over the same period. We ended Q3 with $4.8 billion of liquidity. Improving profits and strong cash management are also benefiting our net leverage, which declined sequentially, again, coming in at 3x in Q3, more than a full turn lower than where we exited fiscal '23.\nWe continue focusing on returning net leverage to our long-term target of at or below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We entered fiscal '24 with a plan of applying our controlling the controllables approach to enhance free cash flow generation. We've over-delivered on that plan and remain committed to deploying resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nNow let's look at our updated outlook for fiscal '24. We are reiterating our overall sales guidance at roughly flat year-over-year. Based primarily on our improved outlook for chicken, we are raising our AOI guidance and tightening the range. For the total company, we now expect between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. Moving to the segments. In chicken, given the strong performance, we're raising our AOI guidance range to be between $850 million and $950 million. For Prepared Foods, we are reiterating our AOI outlook of $850 million to $950 million, as we continue to perform in line with expectations.\nIn beef, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to a loss between $400 million and $300 million, reflecting well-known challenges in the cattle cycle. In pork, we are raising our AOI outlook to be between $100 million and $200 million highlighted improved year-to-date results versus expectations. To round out the key P&L items, we continue to anticipate interest expense [indiscernible] CapEx we are maintaining our tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flows and are narrowing our CapEx range to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion this year.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Donnie, I want to emphasize that our multi-protein multichannel strategy is enabling us to raise the midpoint of our full year AOI guidance by $100 million. Now I'll hand it over to Donnie to wrap up before we move to Q&A.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Curt. Before we get to your questions, I want to express my deep gratitude to our incredible team members. Their dedication and hard work are the driving forces behind our mission to feed the world like family and bring high-quality food to every table in the world. Together, we have achieved a remarkable turnaround and our momentum continues. Finally, I am grateful to our customers and consumers for their trust, loyalty and partnership. I couldn't be more excited for the opportunities ahead of us and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder value.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sean Cornett, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nGood morning. and welcome to Tyson Foods' Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, Tyson's President and Chief Executive Officer, Donnie King; and Chief Financial Officer, John R. Tyson, will provide some prepared remarks followed by Q&A. Additionally, joining us today are Brady Stewart, Group President, Beef, Pork and Chief Supply Chain Officer; Melanie Boulden, Group President, Prepared Foods and Chief Growth Officer; Wes Morris, Group President, Poultry; and Amy Tu, President, International. .\nWe also have provided a supplemental presentation, which may be referenced on today's call and is available on Tyson's Investor Relations website via the link in our webcast.

We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in our marks are on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I'm pleased with our performance in Q2, and I want to thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to driving operational excellence. We've certainly come a long way from where we were a year ago and wouldn't be where we are today without their hard work.\nOur momentum continues to strengthen and all of our businesses are running better today than they were last year. Our results this quarter are part of a solid performance in the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to the first half of last year. Adjusted EPS and adjusted operating income are both up nearly 60% while operating cash flow increased by more than 50%, and CapEx decreased by more than 40%. This performance gives us confidence in our improved outlook for the fiscal year and in our long-term future.\nAs you saw in our results, tailwinds in chicken again offset headwinds in beef as we benefit from our multi-protein portfolio. While we're not immune to the macro environment, we are taking steps to reduce our exposure to commodity markets. We are expanding our offerings in seasoned and marinated meats to value up our portfolio across beef, pork and chicken to provide consumers convenience and new flavor options. Across our brands, we are focusing on meeting the consumers where they are by offering convenient restaurant-quality food options at home.\nWe are a leader in protein with some of the most iconic brands in food with offerings that span the value spectrum. This is why our share remains healthy despite a more challenging environment for consumers. We continue to support our brands through efficient marketing, effective innovation and strong partnerships with our customers. We continue to build financial strength by being disciplined in our capital deployment to improve cash flow and position us well to tackle challenges and capture opportunities. We also continue to take bold actions to improve performance and drive long-term value for shareholders, and I remain highly confident in our strategy and optimistic about our future.\nNow let's delve into an update on market share. At Tyson Foods, we have a broad portfolio of offerings across food service and retail at a range of price points to meet consumers where they are, even as they manage through a challenging macro environment. We also have some of the strongest and most iconic brands across food and beverage behind the Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm names, which allows us to make efficient choices to maintain margin while strengthening our shelf position. We see this in the strength of our dollar share in our core business lines, which we believe reflects the quality of our share position.\nSince Q2 of fiscal 2019, we've added 400 basis points of dollar share in our core business lines. While our share is down modestly versus last year as we lap some record performance, we have gained dollar share over each of the past 3 quarters. Our core bacon brands, Wright and Jimmy Dean have contributed to this recent growth. In fact, our dollar share in bacon for Q2 was at a record high level over the past 5 years, and we were the fastest growing in the category during the quarter. I'm excited about our opportunities in bacon and expect our share to continue improving as our new bacon facility that opened in January ramps up. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonate strongly with our consumers and our market share and household penetration rates remain healthy. We continue to have opportunity to expand the household penetration of our great brands. leaving room for continued share growth over the long run.\nMoving on to the segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. Consumers' focus on value continues to impact our retail volumes. However, our share remains healthy. And as I mentioned, we are gaining dollar share in bacon. Our volumes outside of retail continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin-accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove solid profitability both in Q2 and the first half of fiscal '24. In Chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q2. In fact, versus the second quarter of last year, AOI increased more than $325 million. While we are benefiting from better market conditions, including lower grain costs, our bold actions and focus on the fundamentals are also evident in our results. We have made progress across the value chain. Our live operations are substantially better. We've improved yield, labor efficiencies and utilization in our plants. Our demand planning and customer service have also taken significant steps forward. When our live operations are running well and our demand plan is more accurate, we can operate more efficiently and better service our customers. In summary, our focus on getting back to the basics in chicken is working.\nAs you all know, in beef, limited cattle supplies led to spread compression despite some quarterly volatility reflecting market conditions, our results for the first half of fiscal year have come in as we expected. Our goal remains to offset some of the challenges of a tight cattle supply environment by focusing on the controllables such as labor utilization and managing mix to meet customer and consumer demand.\nTurning to Pork. Better spreads and ongoing operational execution led to improved profitability in the quarter. in the first half of the year. As you may have seen, we made the difficult decision to close one of our pork facilities. This is part of our efforts to optimize our footprint and improve performance by reallocating resources to nearby more efficient plants while improving mix and better serving our customers.\nNow let me take a step back and talk about our recent corporate rebranding initiative. We launched a new corporate logo earlier this year that captures our One Team, One Tyson spirit. It encompasses our differentiated capabilities and scale and our diverse portfolio across channels, categories and eating occasions. Our Tyson Foods corporate logo represents our company's legacy and our team's purpose, which is to feed the world by family. Our approach to driving long-term value hasn't changed and is built on a core of 3 key pillars. First, we are fortifying our foundation of core proteins. We strive to be best-in-class operators while continuing to look for ways to value up our portfolio. Second, we are building our brands by delivering innovation for new occasions, categories and channels to better serve consumers. Today, we have 3 of the top 10 protein brands with room to expand our household penetration. Brands are our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins and stronger returns. Third, we're growing globally. Our international business grew revenue eightfold to $2.5 billion over the 5 years through fiscal '23. We expect to drive profitable growth over time by capturing expanding consumer markets, particularly in Asia, and we believe we are well positioned to win. These strategic pillars are supported by key enablers of operational excellence, customer and consumer obsession, along with data and digital.\nA key element of operational excellence is to gain enterprise scale and unlock savings in our controllables by modernizing our operations and driving performance to standards. We win with our customers by building long-term partnerships and delivering top-tier experiences. We enrich consumers' lives by creating best-in-class marketing and innovation. Finally, we continue to build our digital capabilities utilizing data, automation and AI tech for better decision-making and outcomes.\nBefore I hand it over to John to review our financial performance, let me remind you of our priorities this year, where we focused on controlling the controllables. Our results for the first half of the year clearly shows that we are controlling our CapEx and working capital to drive strong cash flow.\nAnother priority is to optimize our footprint and network. We closed the last of the 6 chicken facilities that we announced in 2023, along with the 2 case-ready beef facilities. And as mentioned earlier, we are closing one of our pork plants. We're also focused on operational excellence by restoring performance in chicken, strengthening prepared foods, managing beef through a difficult cattle cycle and driving efficiencies in pork. As you have seen in our results so far this year, we are making tangible progress in all these areas.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn R. Tyson\n\nExecutive VP of Strategy & Chief Sustainability Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments.\nSales in Q2 were essentially in line year-over-year at $13.1 billion as a decrease in chicken was nearly offset by an increase in beef. Adjusted operating income increased $341 million year-over-year to $406 million, driven primarily by significant improvement in chicken profitability. Operational performance and substantially higher AOI led to a $0.66 increase in adjusted EPS, which came in at $0.62 in Q2.\nNow let's review our segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q2 revenue was down slightly year-over-year. Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition. The pricing decline reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q2 was down modestly versus last year. Lower raw material costs and operational efficiencies were more than offset by start-up costs and mix. Despite the decline in AOI, our margin for the first half of the fiscal year remained in the low double digits.\nMoving to chicken. Sales in Q2 declined 8.2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume. Volume declined 6.1%, driven by lower production as we better aligned our supply to customer demand, while the 2.1% reduction in pricing was due in part to the pass-through of lower input costs. Despite the decline in sales, AOI increased $326 million year-over-year to $160 million. The benefits of our strategic actions and the substantial operational improvements we've executed since last year are clear. Market conditions, including lower input costs, net of pass-through pricing, and a better supply-demand balance were also key contributors to improved profitability. The current quarter results include a $55 million derivative loss compared to a $35 million loss in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, our grain hedging program as part of an overarching risk management strategy and not a speculative tool.\nIn our Beef segment, revenue was up 7.3% year-over-year in Q2, with both volume and pricing increases. The 2.8% increase in volume was primarily driven by higher average carcass [indiscernible], while pricing increased 4.5%. While revenue increased AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads as expected. This more than offset continued progress on our operational efficiencies, including better labor utilization and better management of product mix to meet customer and consumer demand.\nMoving to Pork. Q2 revenue increased 4.6%, driven by volume growth and higher pricing. Volume growth of 2.9% was led by more plentiful hog supply. Pricing improved due to healthy global demand. AOI also increased year-over-year going from a loss of $31 million last year to a profit of $33 million this year in Q2, benefiting primarily from improved spreads and better operational execution. Year-to-date, pork AOI has improved $151 million. Finally, our international business continues to make progress towards stronger profitability. AOI increased versus last year as we begin to lap some of the start-up costs of our newer facilities and continue to focus on operational execution.\nShifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Year-to-date showcased strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion as we continue to manage working capital. We remain very disciplined with CapEx, which came in at $621 million for the first half. The $267 million in CapEx for Q2 was the lowest quarterly spend in several years and represents the fifth quarter in a row of sequential decline as we lap our elevated CapEx from the previous 2 fiscal years. and focus on controlling where and when we deploy capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $556 million, increased nearly $900 million versus the first half of last year and was more than $200 million ahead of our year-to-date dividend payments.\nOur balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning net leverage to at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA.\nOur net leverage again declined sequentially, coming in at 3.6x in Q2, driven by improving last 12 months EBITDA, and we expect it to continue to improve for the balance of the year. We ended Q2 with $4.4 billion of liquidity. As you may have seen from our press release in March, we successfully raised $1.5 billion in new senior notes, and we paid down a portion of our term loans. We plan to use the remaining proceeds to retire our outstanding notes coming due this August. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nNow let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. We are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year. However, given our strong year-to-date results, we are raising our AOI guidance driven primarily by an improved outlook for chicken. For the total company, we now expect between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion of operating income.\nMoving to the segments. In Chicken, given the strong start in the first half of the year, we continue to believe that there are more tailwinds than headwinds. We are raising our AOI guidance range to be between $700 million and $900 million. Prepared Foods also had a solid first half. In this segment, we are tightening our AOI outlook to be between $850 million and $950 million, indicating a weaker second half of the year, which reflects typical seasonality.\nIn Beef, the first half of fiscal 2024 has progressed in line with our expectations. However, uncertainties remain, including the progression of the cattle cycle, and we now expect our full year AOI to be between a loss of $400 million and a loss of $100 million. In Pork, we've seen solid first half performance and are raising our guidance to be between $50 million and $150 million. To add some color to the shape of the rest of the year, uncertainties remain around consumer strength and behavior, the progression of the cattle cycle and key commodity costs. When we factor in these variables with pork and prepared foods seasonality, there are reasons to believe that Q3 could be weaker than Q4. Around out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million and our tax rate to now be approximately 24%.\nTurning to CapEx. We're maintaining tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flow, and we are narrowing our CapEx range to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion this year. And finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and CapEx and we're even more confident now that we can fully fund our dividend this year through our free cash flow generation.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Donnie to wrap up before we move to Q&A.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to thank our 139,000 team members who worked tirelessly to feed the world like family and fulfill our mission to bring high-quality food to every table in the world. It is the strength of our team that secures our position as a world-class food company and a recognized leader in protein. Together, we delivered a solid first half, we still have more work to do and believe we have the strategy in place to continue our progress and deliver long-term shareholder value.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move to your questions.

King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, fiscal 2024 is off to a good start with solid performance in Q1, giving us confidence in our full year outlook. The momentum we established in the back half of last year continued in Q1, highlighted by $175 million improvement in adjusted operating income. 130 basis points of AOI margin expansion and near doubling of adjusted EPS, all on a sequential basis. .\nAs we begin fiscal '24, we're witnessing the benefits of our core multi-protein portfolio. Chicken and pork are offsetting beef headwinds and while Prepared Foods continues to generate strong profit dollars and margins. While we can't control the macro environment, our focus on what we can control has been evident in Q1. Our performance reflects a commitment to operational excellence. We are more agile, collaborative and disciplined business than a year ago, and we have a long runway of opportunities in front of us. I'm proud of our team members' continued efforts to enhance operational performance and want to thank all of them for their high level of engagement and their part in delivering our results in this quarter. We're controlling what we can to drive cash flow as well. Our disciplined approach to CapEx and working capital helped generate strong cash flow in the quarter.\nPrudent cash deployment as part of our strategy to build financial strength and will position us well when market dynamics turn in our favor. You've seen us take bold actions to improve performance, and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence and address inefficiencies. Our plan is working, and we're seeing tangible benefits of our efforts as evidenced by improvements in chicken and pork. While I'm pleased by the performance in Q1, we still have more work ahead of us and we're cautiously optimistic and laser-focused on achieving what we set out to do this year. Our brands resonate with consumers, and we're maintaining strong market share despite comparing to our record position last year and some overall category consumption softness in Q1. We will continue to support our brands through innovation, marketing and strong customer partnerships while meeting consumers where they are. I remain highly confident in our long-term strategy based on a broad portfolio of core proteins and strong brands and I'm optimistic about our future.\nWe're leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Now let's delve into an update on share position of our branded portfolio. Our Q1 [indiscernible] share in our core business lines, which include product lines from our iconic brands, Hyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, State Fair, Aidells and Ball Park, remains at historically high levels despite a modest decline compared to record share in Q1 last year. In fact, our core business lines have grown pound share by more than 400 basis points since Q1 of 2019. While inflation is easy, consumers are still facing high prices compared to 2 years ago. However, they are still willing to purchase brands they know and trust, and this is reflected in our share. We're also focused on customer elasticity and balancing with our own costs. We believe our approach is working. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonate strongly with consumers.\nOver the past year, nearly 3 out of 4 U.S. households purchased a Tyson Core business line product, and this penetration rate is growing. What gets me even more excited is that our product line with the highest penetration rate is only in about 1/3 of households, leaving us plenty of room for continued growth over the long run. Moving on to segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. Our foodservice volumes continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin-accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove strong adjusted operating profits and margins. Our branded foods business remains a strategic growth pillar, and we are committed to supporting and growing our brands through innovation, price pack architecture, high ROI marketing support and strong customer partnerships. This is critically important in an economic environment where consumers remain more discerning with their purchasing decisions.\nIn chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q1 with a third consecutive quarter of over $100 million in sequential AOI increase. Operational improvements, including the bold actions we've taken, along with improvements in live operations, yield, labor efficiency and customer service, as well as improving market conditions were the primary drivers in Q1. In beef, limited cattle supply led to spread compression as we expected. Roughly half the loss in Q1 was related to an inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily driven by highly volatile [indiscernible] futures. While spreads are expected to remain tight, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators so that we can manage the business as efficiently as possible. We have identified incremental opportunities to improve our execution and help offset some of the challenges from the current cattle cycle.\nTurning to pork. Better supply drove lower hog costs, leading to improving spreads. Our team's focus on operational execution allowed us to capture the benefit of these favorable market dynamics which resulted in improved profits both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before I hand it over to John for a financial review, let's reiterate our priorities for the year. First, we're committed to improving our financial strength and driving cash flow to support our dividend, as demonstrated in Q1. Over the past year, we announced the closure of 6 of our older, less efficient plants in chicken and 2 of our smaller beef, case-ready value-added facilities. We are already seeing the benefits of these actions, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to drive efficiency across our segments.\nIn chicken, our focus on enhancing our competitiveness continues. In Prepared Foods, we want to build growth momentum behind capacity additions coming online, increase our brand household penetration and diversify and grow our foodservice business. In beef, we acknowledge the challenges and will be prepared for multiple outcomes during the current cattle cycle. In pork, we're gaining momentum in operational execution and are excited for continued improvements. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results and outlook.\n\nJohn R. Tyson\n\nExecutive VP of Strategy & Chief Sustainability Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments. Sales in Q1 grew slightly year-over-year as an increase in beef revenue was nearly offset by a decrease in chicken. The decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in beef, which was partially offset by growth in chicken and pork. It's important to note that AOI improved significantly on a sequential basis despite the modest decline versus last year. Adjusted EPS nearly doubled compared to last quarter, highlighting the ongoing improvement in our operational performance.\nNow let's review our segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q1 revenue was flat year-over-year. Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition and continued recovery in our foodservice business. Lower pricing primarily reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q1 was also in line with last year. Lower raw material cost and operational efficiencies were offset by increased brand support expenses, start-up costs associated with new capacity additions and mix. AOI dollars and margin both increased significantly on a sequential basis due to strong operational performance and great seasonal execution by the team.\nMoving on to chicken. Sales in Q1 declined 5.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of lower commodity protein prices. Volume declined 1.5% due to lower production, which was partially offset by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory. Despite the decline in sales versus last year, AOI more than doubled in Q1, primarily driven by the benefits of our strategic actions and other operational efficiencies. These include lower plant spend, improved yield and better live performance.\nWhile input costs were a clear tailwind, these were largely offset by the impact of lower pricing. As Donnie mentioned, this is the third consecutive quarter of more than $100 million of AOI improvement as we were able to pull forward the benefits of closures of inefficient plants and improvements in our live operations.\nNow moving to beef. In beef, revenue increased 6.4% year-over-year in Q1 with lower head throughput more than offset by higher prices per pound. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads as was expected. As Donnie mentioned, in Q1, nearly half of the operating loss was driven by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily due to the rapid and significant decline in cattle futures. Moving to pork. Q1 revenue was down modestly as volume growth was offset by lower pricing. However, AOI increased year-over-year, benefiting primarily from improved spreads driven by lower hog costs as well as better execution. And finally, a brief comment on our international business. AOI improved as we begin to lap some of the start-up costs of our newer facilities and continue to focus on improving execution despite a decline in sales driven by macroeconomic challenges.\nShifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders primarily via our dividend remains unwavering. While market conditions remain challenging, we are laser-focused on disciplined management and deployment of our capital resources to drive cash flow. Q1 showcased a robust operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, above our expectations, and working capital was a solid source of cash as we continue to manage inventory levels. We were also disciplined with CapEx, which came in at just over $350 million in the quarter, below last year's exit rate. During the quarter, we returned $171 million to shareholders via dividends. Our net leverage declined sequentially, coming below 4x, driven by our improved profitability and strong cash generation. We ended Q1 with more than $3.7 billion of liquidity. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning net leverage to at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA.\nWe remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. Given the solid results in Q1, we have confidence that our financial performance in 2024 will improve versus last year. However, as it's still early in the new fiscal year and uncertainties remain, especially in our Beef segment, we have made only modest changes to our outlook. Our focus for fiscal 2024 remains to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation, reflected in our guidance presented in dollar terms rather than margin percentages. With that in mind, we are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year.\nMoving to each of the segments. Prepared Foods had a solid start and a seasonally strong period. For the remainder of the year, we expect strong volume results as we continue our momentum in foodservice and see the benefits of our capacity additions. We remain focused on operational efficiencies while we support our brands and anticipate continued start-up costs. Taking all this into account, we're maintaining our AOI guidance to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. In chicken, our operational turnaround is progressing as anticipated. For the remainder of the year, we expect to return to normal seasonality where Q2 is typically a weaker quarter. Given the strong start in Q1 and that we believe that there are more tailwinds and headwinds, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to be between $500 million and $700 million.\nIn beef, spreads are compressing as expected. However, uncertainty remains around how the cattle cycle will progress. Therefore, we are maintaining our full year guidance at a loss of $400 million to breakeven. In pork, on the back of our strong Q1 results, we're now raising our guidance to be between breakeven and $100 million. For the total company AOI, we're maintaining our guidance of between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, reflecting the portfolio nature of our segments. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million and a tax rate to now be between 23% and 24%.\nTurning to CapEx. We're maintaining tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flow and we expect CapEx to remain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion this year. Finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and CapEx, and we're even more confident now than we were last quarter that we will generate positive free cash flow for the year. To further help model the shape of the rest of the year, we anticipate more typical seasonality across our business. As a reminder, Q2 is seasonally our weakest quarter for AOI and cash flow driven by beef and chicken. And as you may be aware, this January has already been impacted by severe winter weather disrupting operations. And again, we expect start-up costs in Prepared Foods to impact Q2 as well.\nSo in summary, 2024 is off to a promising start, and we're cautiously optimistic on our prospects for the remainder of the year as well as for the long term. Tyson is a leader in the global protein industry. We have strong brands, a broad portfolio of products and a great team, all of which uniquely position us to win in the market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. ."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Sean Cornett, VP of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Tyson Foods' Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Earlier this morning, we announced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2023 results. In Q4, we saw another quarter of sequential improvements in our overall earnings as we continue to make good progress in improving our performance. And I want to thank our team members for delivering these results in what continues to be a tough macro environment. Consumer demand for protein remains relatively stable, and we are well positioned to meet this demand, giving us confidence in our long-term prospects. Q4 also wraps up an unusual fiscal year where all of our core protein categories were challenged and yet one where our branded business delivered solid results, while we continue to see challenging market dynamics, our broader portfolio is set up well for the future.\nAs we anticipated, our results continued to improve sequentially in Chicken, with Q4 building on the momentum we gained in Q3 as part of a much better second half of fiscal '23 after a difficult start. Our brands continue to perform well, and we grew market share across our core business lines, outperforming our peers. This helped our Prepared Foods segment generated solid adjusted operating income in 2023. Market dynamics in beef and pork were challenging this past year causing spread compression, although for different reasons. Despite these headwinds, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators so that we can manage these businesses as efficiently as possible.\nWe remain focused on what we can control. One of our priorities is to execute with excellence. Our operations have improved across the business, and we have a long runway of opportunities to perform better. Controlling the controllables extends to capital allocation as well where we will remain disciplined with CapEx and working capital. We continue to execute our [ multipoint plan ] focused on efficiency and modernization. You've seen us take bold actions to improve performance and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence and address inefficiencies.\nOur plan is working, and we are seeing tangible benefits of our efforts to end fiscal 2023. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy and optimistic about our future. Rest assured that we are leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Let's dive into an overview of segment performance by starting with an update on market share. Our brands continue to outpace the broader food and beverage category in volume growth across the retail channel in Q4. Our volume grew while the overwhelming majority of food and beverage peers saw volume declines. Our core business lines, including the iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, saw Q4 volume growth of 3.2% versus last year, far outpacing our competition.\nThose 4 brands also all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both pound and dollar share gains across our core business lines. We are accelerating foodservice where our Focus 6 categories, including value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon and Philly steaks outpaced the broadline industry and volume growth in the quarter both versus last year and sequentially. We have a strong foodservice portfolio and are aligning with key customers as we build momentum for the future. Speaking of winning with customers, we're proud to have made the top 10 for the second year in a row in the most recent Kantar PoweRanking. In fact, Tyson finished in the top 10 in 7 of the 9 categories they measure as we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with them.\nMoving to our segments, beginning with Prepared Foods. As I mentioned, our brands performed well in Q4, in fact, over the last year. Nearly 3/4 of U.S. households purchased a Tyson Core business line product which is an increase of 90 basis points. While this is impressive across our portfolio, it's worth noting that our product with the highest penetration rate is only in about 1/3 of households, leaving us room for continued growth. This performance in Retail Health Prepared Foods have a solid year in fiscal '23, with strong growth in AOI.\nAs you know, our branded foods business is a strategic growth pillar for the future. We believe it is imperative to support our brands with marketing and advertising. As consumers begin to face what could be a more difficult economic environment, we ramped up our MAP support for our brands in the second half of the year, and we'll continue to do so as we move into fiscal 2024.\nWhile the full year AOI for chicken was a modest loss, our progress toward improved performance continued in Q4. We with sequential improvement versus Q3. In fact, this is the second consecutive quarter with more than $100 million in sequential AOI increases. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished over the past 6 months. Not only did we hold on to the operational enhancements we made in Q3, we made incremental improvements in yield and in our live operations. This allowed us to take advantage of improving market conditions, including lower grain costs, leading to a positive margin to end the year.\nAs we head into new fiscal year, we expect a better outlook for input costs while seeing the benefits of some of the bold actions we took this year. Coming into fiscal '23, we expected beef to be under pressure due to limited cattle supply. This trend held true as cattle costs appreciated at a faster rate than the wholesale price of boxed beef, eroding export opportunities due to a strong U.S. dollar and low price of competing exporters and ultimately creating a very tight spread scenario. We also expected to see signs of rebuild of the herd to surface as cattle prices moved higher.\nHowever, this did not materialize. Until significant heifer retention and subsequent herd rebuilding takes place, we expect challenging supply conditions to remain. In this context, while the timing remains uncertain, we will be prepared by focusing on operational discipline. Moving to Pork. As you know, in fiscal '23, the industry suffered from supply and demand imbalances, which negatively impacted spreads while we are seeing some signs of improving spreads and lower grain costs, there is still an imbalance between supply and demand of pork.\nOur team is focused on running the business as efficiently as possible while continuing to review all the options. We saw significant sequential and year-over-year improvement in AOI in Q4 driven primarily by improving spreads and operational enhancements. Before I turn the call over to John to review our financials and FY '24 guidance, I want to give you my priorities for the coming year. First is improving our financial strength with a focus on cash. I want to emphasize that we will be disciplined and prudent with capital while remaining committed to our dividend as the primary way of returning cash to shareholders.\nAs you saw in our earnings press release this morning, we increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year. We will continue to evaluate our production footprint and network to drive efficiencies. As you saw, we've made significant changes in chicken by announcing the closure of 6 of our older, less efficient plants, which we expect to improve our capacity utilization and mix. In a similar move to leverage efficiencies and reduced network redundancies, we also recently made the difficult decision to take 2 of our smaller fresh meats, case-ready value-added facilities off-line.\nProduction from these locations will shift to larger, more efficient plants, and our harvest capacity sales volume and importantly, our customers will see no impact. We are reviewing whether there are similar opportunities across our segments. In chicken, we will remain focused on further enhancing our competitiveness going forward. Prepared Foods was the profit engine for the company last year. We want to sustain and build on a strength by supporting our brands and driving momentum in food service while being responsive to changes in the market conditions. Some of the key focus areas are making better use of our data, shifting more of our MAP support to digital media and being disciplined with revenue management.\nIn these, multiple outcomes are possible during the current catalyst cycle. We believe we have best-in-class assets and team members and are aligning with the right suppliers and customers, giving us confidence that we'll be prepared for all of them. In Pork, we believe we have a bright future ahead of us and are excited about the team we've built that continues to drive operational improvements and synergies with our Prepared Foods business.\nAs we said before, we are taking a hard look at our cost structure to drive operational excellence. Our ongoing productivity initiatives are focused on things that can be deployed at scale, enterprise-wide, including procurement, logistics and digitalization. These are a few of the initiatives that will make us a fundamentally stronger business as we go forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn R. Tyson\n\nExecutive VP of Strategy & Chief Sustainability Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results and then review our individual segments. Our sales were down year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal '23 driven by Pork and Chicken, where we saw a reduction in price per pound. The decline in adjusted operating profit for both periods was driven by lower profitability in beef and chicken. While profit in Q4 was down substantially versus last year, it's important to note that it continued to improve on a sequential basis and adjusted EPS more than doubled compared to Q3. Challenges remain, but we continue to drive efficiencies and improve our operations, and we believe we're headed in the right direction.\nNow on to the individual segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, revenue was down modestly in Q4 year-over-year, driven by lower bacon pricing. This lower pricing was offset by volume growth, which highlights the strength of our brands. AOI improved slightly year-over-year despite lower sales. Our ongoing productivity initiatives and easing inflation offset lower pricing, increased marketing, advertising and promotional support and the onset of start-up costs for our new facilities.\nAOI margin declined sequentially in Q4 due to seasonality, increased brand support and start-up costs. However, the $151 million of AOI this segment generated is the second highest Q4 result in the past 5 years and full year fiscal '23 AOI grew by more than $100 million, representing growth of nearly 14% year-over-year. Now moving to chicken. Sales declined 10% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by lower pricing, reflecting primarily lower commodity protein prices. Volume grew modestly in Q4 versus last year, driven by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory, and this was partially offset by a decline in production. This decrease in production highlights our ongoing focus on balancing supply with our customers' demand.\nYear-over-year profitability declined, primarily due to lower commodity chicken pricing, but this was partially offset by lower input costs and operational efficiencies. On a sequential basis, lower grain cost and productivity enhancements drove another quarter of AOI improvement. In fact, when we compare to Q4 to Q2, chicken AOI increased by more than $240 million. In beef, revenue increased modestly year-over-year in Q4 with lower head throughput, offset by higher pricing.\nOperating profit was down, reflecting compressed spreads primarily due to higher cattle costs. As we have been discussing all year, Beef is likely to continue to face headwinds, including in fiscal '24 as we don't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until [ herd ] rebuilding is underway. Moving on to Pork. Revenue was down nearly 7%, driven primarily by lower pricing due to softer global demand. AOI for the quarter was a modest loss, but importantly, it increased by more than $40 million year-over-year and by more than $60 million sequentially as spreads improved along with operating performance.\nBefore moving to our capital priorities, it's worth noting that our international business posted solid Q4 and fiscal '23 results driven by growing penetration across our key markets and channels. We remain focused on market share growth and continued operational excellence as we ramp up our new facilities. Now to our financial position and capital priorities, we're building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders, primarily via our dividend remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy.\nAs Donnie said earlier, we will remain disciplined and prudent with capital. We came into fiscal '23 with a plan to spend roughly $2.5 billion in CapEx. As you saw, we ended up reducing our spend by $600 million as we reacted to market conditions driving lower profitability and impacting our operating cash flow. We were also disciplined managing working capital, which was a source of cash this year. We ended the year with $3 billion of liquidity and net leverage of just over 4x. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning to net leverage of at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA.\nDuring the year, we returned $670 million to shareholders via dividends and $354 million in share repurchases, primarily to offset dilution. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's review our outlook for fiscal 2024. Fiscal '23 was a challenging year, and we took a hard look at how we manage the business in times like these and how we can better communicate and manage expectations for investors.\nOur focus for fiscal '24 is to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation. These are our internal goals and what we want investors to understand. So for this year, as you'll see, we are giving guidance in dollar terms instead of a margin percentage. While there are some top line uncertainties within the individual protein categories, we expect our overall sales to be approximately in line with fiscal '23. Moving on to the segments. Prepared Foods has been a solid and stable driver of operating cash flow. We expect that to continue in fiscal '24 driven by volume growth, disciplined revenue management and productivity offset by MAP support for our brands and the start-up costs for our new facilities as well as risks from changes in consumer behavior.\nReflecting these dynamics, our expectations for adjusted operating income is in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. To help navigate any potential shifts in consumer spending and sentiment we are focused on the most efficient marketing, advertising and promotions that drive the highest ROI and the most effective consumer engagement and demand. To help meet demand in value-added brands and categories, we had previously invested in new capacity, and we expect to incur start-up costs in fiscal '24. On to chicken. Our operational turnaround in chicken is progressing as we expected. We demonstrated sequential profit improvement in Q3 and again in Q4. We anticipate operational improvements to continue into next year, and that, along with lower input costs net of pass-through pricing, this segment should generate between $400 million and $700 million of adjusted operating income.\nNow on to our Beef segment. When and how fast meaningful heifer retention will take hold is uncertain at this point, and this influences our outlook for our Beef segment in 2024. Multiple outcomes are possible, and we will be prepared for all of them to operate as efficiently as we can. Our guidance for this segment is a loss of $400 million to break even for the year, reflecting uncertainty in market dynamics. Now on to our Pork segment, where we see momentum in the business.\nAs spreads begin to improve and we continue to execute, we expect AOI to improve versus last year to roughly breakeven for fiscal 2024. For the total company, we've given a range of outcomes for each segment, but we expect any outsized weakness or strength in any one area to be balanced by the remainder of the portfolio. In other words, neither the low end nor high end of the range is anticipated to happen simultaneously across all the businesses. As a result, we expect our total company AOI for fiscal '24 to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion.\nTo further help understand the shape of the year, let me provide some context on the quarterly phasing. While we foresee more typical seasonality in our business for next year, things like start-up costs in prepared foods and rising cattle costs will impact Q1 and Q2 and generally shift profitability to the back half of fiscal '24. In addition, we are monitoring potential impacts to the consumer of higher interest rates and inflation, which could create some volatility. Now to round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million for the year, and our tax rate to be approximately 23%.\nWe moderated our pace of CapEx in fiscal '23 in a challenging environment. We ended the year with $375 million of expenditures in Q4, which annualizes to $1.5 billion. As we maintain tight controls on our spending in line with profitability and cash flow, we expect CapEx for the year to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion. While there are a range of possible outcomes for AOI, we expect to manage our working capital and CapEx so that we're free cash flow positive for the year.\nIn summary, while the current operating environment remains difficult, we are making improvements across our operations and remain optimistic on our long-term prospects. We have great teams, growing demand for our products and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace. Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We will now move on to your questions.

King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we review the results, I'd like to start out by discussing my vision for Tyson and the decisive actions that we are taking to successfully navigate the current market environment.\nWe remain fully committed to our vision of delivering sustainable top line growth and margin improvement over the long run. With our leadership team, we are executing a multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization, including taking a much closer look at our cost structure across the business to drive operational excellence. We are already seeing tangible benefits of our efforts. We've been through market cycles before, and I'm confident that we have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to emerge stronger from this one.\nWe are making good progress and saw sequential improvements in our results in Q3. We're not yet where we need to be, so we continue to focus on what we can control. Earlier today, we announced our intention to close 4 more of our chicken facilities, demonstrating our commitment to taking bold actions to improve performance.\nBeyond these important actions, I remain optimistic about our future. We are a leader in our industry, and we continue to innovate and take market share in most of our categories. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy, and we are leaving no stone unturned to maximize value for shareholders.\nDiving into our results. We continue to compare against strong performance across our segments last year. However, I am encouraged by the sequential improvements we've made in Q3.\nLet me start with Chicken. Market conditions in Chicken are still challenged with commodity prices across most cuts remaining significantly lower compared to last year. However, adjusted operating income improved by more than $100 million sequentially without any material benefits of market tailwinds.\nThe sequential increase was primarily due to internal actions we took. For example, in our fiscal Q2, we decided to close 2 of our plants, convert 2 others to boneless and rationalize our SKUs, inventory and other assets. In Q3, the team made significant improvements in yield, spend and efficiency, leading to strong improvement in profitability in just 1 quarter.\nAs we become more productive with automation and team member engagement, we can further optimize our footprint and reallocate resources to more efficient plants while still having ample capacity to service and grow with our customers. This enabled us to announce today that we plan to close 4 additional chicken facilities, bringing the total announced closures to 6 this year.\nWe also recently made the decision to transition away from the no-antibiotics-ever labeling for Tyson-branded chicken to a \"no antibiotics important for human medicine\" approach. Data suggests the use of onaforce can lead to more uniform birds with consistent weight. In turn, we can more accurately forecast supply and demand, helping to meet the needs of our customers and consumers.\nAnd I want to emphasize that we will continue to evaluate all options, including more actions like these across all of our businesses. In Beef, we performed better than expected. Our results were driven by our disciplined approach to balancing supply with customer demand while taking advantage of seasonal increases in cutout values.\nHowever, the beef industry will likely continue facing headwinds. As you may have seen in the latest USDA cattle inventory report, herd liquidation continues to tighten supply, leading to higher cattle cost, narrowing spreads and difficult export market conditions. Work remains under pressure across the industry, and we continue to see headwinds there with both our internal live production and our external sourced hog supply, increased feed cost and low cutouts drove spread compression through our results. We also had incremental negative impacts in Q3 from a fire at one of our processing facilities.\nFinally, to Prepared Foods, which is a key growth pillar for the future. The business performed well in Q3. In retail, our core business lines saw strong volume growth in the quarter and continued to gain pound and dollar share.\nIn broadline foodservice, Tyson Focus 6 continues to outpace the industry in volume growth. This led to better-than-anticipated margins in Prepared Foods. In short, our results this quarter demonstrate that Chicken is gaining momentum, and our branded foods business remains an area of strength.\nLet me add some further color on the performance of our branded business versus our top peers. As I mentioned earlier, our Tyson core business lines, including the iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, continue to outpace total food and beverage and our peers in volume growth up 5% versus a year ago. We believe this points to the strength of our core brands and sets us up well for the future.\nWe continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate and across dayparts. Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin. Our share performance and brand strength demonstrate the momentum we've gained with consumers, and they will continue to spend on brands they know and trust. Likewise, we will continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands.\nWhile we are pleased with our brand strength and share performance, we are constantly building new innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for our products. Over the past few years, our innovations have generated roughly $2 billion in annual sales. Let me highlight a few products we've launched this fiscal year that I'm most excited about.\nEarlier this year, we announced the Tyson Original Chicken Breast Sandwich for retail channel, which won the People Magazine Food Award for Best frozen sandwich. Furthermore, we were excited to see that more than 70% of the buyers were new to the Tyson brand and more than 20% were new to the category.\nWe also launched Tyson chicken sandwiches in food service space, where our sandwiches won awards from Food and Beverage Industry, National Agra Marketing Association and National Association of Convenience Stores. As you can see, our innovation in chicken is able to be deployed across channels and occasions, highlighting the power of our scale.\nMoving to Jimmy Dean, which is already a clear leader in the breakfast meal occasion. We're expanding with differentiated capability-based innovation by launching handheld breakfast items. For instance, this year, we launched the Jimmy Dean Biscuit Roll-ups in foodservice channel and Maple Girl Cakes and Toaster Pop-ups in retail. We are seeing strong customer adoption of these products and promising early consumer demand.\nIn Hillshire Farm, one area of focus in retail has been the trend towards healthy snacking. For instance, we launched Hillshire Farm Snack Kits with 100% real premium meats, cheeses and crackers, all ready to eat on the go. If you haven't already, I encourage you to try our Snack Kits like oven-roasted turkey breast, cheddar cheese and wheat crackers. We launched these products at attractive price points and have already seen strong acceptance with major retail customers.\nIn the foodservice channel, we are now participating in the fast-growing cupping pepperoni category with our very own Hillshire-branded Cupping Pepperoni product. We are always on the lookout for how to keep our brands on trend across channels.\nNow I'll turn things over to John to review our financial results for the quarter in more detail.\n\nJohn R. Tyson\n\nExecutive VP of Strategy & Chief Sustainability Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results and then review our individual segments. Our sales were down 2.6% year-over-year driven by pork and chicken, where we saw a reduction in price per pound. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in our Beef and Chicken segments.\nHigher input cost per pound was primarily due to the increase in cattle costs along with unfavorable derivative impacts and higher labor costs, but these were partially offset by lower hog costs, reduced outside purchases of meat in our Chicken segment and lower raw material costs in Prepared Foods.\nWhile profit was down substantially versus last year, it's important to note that it improved meaningfully versus last quarter, and adjusted EPS increased $0.19 on a sequential basis. Challenges remain, but we continue to improve efficiencies by controlling what we can and believe we're heading in the right direction.\nNow on to the individual segment results, starting with Beef. In Beef, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with lower head throughput offset by higher pricing. Operating profit was down, primarily reflecting higher cattle costs, which increased $610 million on a like per pound basis. Operating margin of 1.6% was down from the historically strong margins of more than 10% in Q3 last year.\nOn a sequential basis, disciplined yield and procurement benefits, along with seasonal cutout improvement, helped drive better-than-expected operating profits. Beef is likely to continue to face headwinds, and we don't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding is well underway.\nNow moving to Pork. Revenue was down 18% driven primarily by lower pricing due to softer demand. The operating loss in the quarter was $70 million as spread compression continued to pressure our margins. This was exacerbated by market pressures in our live operations, lower exports and the operational impact of the fire at our Madison facility.\nMoving on to Chicken now. Sales declined 3.5% year-on-year driven by lower pricing, partially offset by volume growth. The decrease in pricing reflects the challenging commodity market. While volume grew modestly versus last year, it decreased more than 4% on a sequential basis. This sequential decline is more than historical seasonality, reflecting steps we took to align internal production to consumer demand while also reducing finished good inventory by $70 million.\nYear-over-year profitability was negatively impacted by market conditions and higher feed costs and a $65 million net derivative loss in the current quarter compared to a $23 million loss in the prior year period. On a sequential basis, it's worth noting that AOI improved by more than $100 million.\nIn Prepared Foods, sales declined 2.6% driven by both volume and price. The volume decline was driven by foodservice as the trajectory of this channel's recovery remains a little uneven. As Donnie mentioned, our [ 46 ] categories are outpacing broadline industry and maintaining their share. Our lower foodservice volumes were partially offset by continued growth in retail, highlighting the strength of our brands.\nLower pricing was primarily driven by lower bacon prices, reflecting the underlying cutout values for bellies. Compared to the prior year period, operating profit was up $34 million due to lower raw material costs and productivity gains, which was partially offset by lower sales, higher packaging costs and increased MAP investments.\nDespite increased spending in brand-building efforts, we were pleased with our operating margin of 9.2%, particularly so given the challenging retail food environment. Our Prepared Foods segment remains key to our strategy, providing a high-margin, stable business with many growth opportunities ahead, helping to offset the pressures and volatility in commodity prices.\nBefore moving on to balance sheet items, I want to provide some context on the goodwill impairment charge that impacted our reported numbers on a GAAP basis. The details of which will be provided in our 10-Q when we file it later this week.\nThe interim impairment testing we did this quarter resulted in noncash charges in the reporting units that we have been disclosing as at risk in our filings going back to last fiscal year. The impacts of the charges are not shown in our presentation this morning as they are not reflected in our adjusted results, but all reconciliations to reported results can be found in the appendix.\nNow to our financial position and capital priorities. We're building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. Q3 operating cash flow was $660 million, in line with expectations with prudent working capital management partially offsetting lower profitability. Inventory reduction was the primary driver of improved core working capital. We still see some opportunity to improve inventory days and drive better cash flow.\nYear-to-date, CapEx is roughly $1.6 billion as we continue to moderate our pace of spending. Based on this pace, we don't expect CapEx to exceed $2.1 billion, below our prior guidance of $2.3 billion.\nWe ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 3.2x. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA for the long term.\nDuring Q3, we returned $167 million to shareholders via dividends and $11 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nNow let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. We're maintaining our total company sales guidance range of $53 billion to $54 billion, and we expect to be at the lower end with roughly flat sales growth for the year.\nTurning to AOI. In Beef, based on our year-to-date results, offset by anticipated live cattle cutout spread compression, we expect full year margins to be at the higher end of our range of between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%.\nFor Pork, due to ongoing market dynamics impacting our Pork segment, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 4% and a loss of 2%, but at the higher end of that range.\nIn Chicken, we're gaining momentum. But with our results year-to-date, including net derivative losses, we expect full year margins to be at the lower end of our range of between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%.\nPrepared Foods has generated strong margins throughout the year. With continued investment to support our brands, we expect margins to be at the higher end of the 8% to 10% range for fiscal 2023. And as I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx to approximately $2.1 billion. Our expectations for net interest expense and tax rate remain unchanged at around $340 million and 22%, respectively.\nSo in summary, while the current operating environment is difficult in several of our businesses, we are making improvements across our operations, and we are optimistic on our long-term growth opportunities. We have great teams across our segments. We've got growing demand for our products and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace.\nSo now I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\n\nSean T. Cornett\n\nSenior Director, Investor Relations & Communications, Valvoline, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instructions."

King\n\nCOO & Group President of Poultry, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Last quarter, we said that we expected Q2 to be tougher than Q1, and this quarter was definitely a tough one. As you will have seen in our release earlier this morning, results were weaker than expected and top line performance was mixed, particularly when compared to our strong performance last year.\nAt the same time, we outperformed our large branded food peers in volume and dollar sales and continue to gain pound and dollar share in our retail core business lines. As I also said last quarter, I can't remember a time when our business faced the highly unusual situation that we're currently seeing, where all 3 of our core protein categories, Beef, Pork and Chicken are experiencing market challenges at the same time. This unusual confluence of issues continued in Q2 and directly impacted our results. I know that you watch the protein markets closely, and like us, know that there are many factors at play here that are macro in nature.\nFor example, Beef is cycling out of historically strong margins that we're seeing throughout most of fiscal 2021 and '22, cutout values across protein complex are much lower than a year ago. Inflation has also remained elevated and persistent, which has dramatically impacted our cost.\nThe current macro backdrop is clearly tough. We have a strong growth strategy and are bullish on our long-term outlook. We continue to implement our strategy, focus on the things that we can control and build upon the strong foundation we have in place.\nLate last month, we announced important initiatives to simplify our structure and rightsize our team. These are a logical next step in our ongoing efforts to drive operational and functional excellence as we strive to be best-in-class in our industry. Last quarter, we talked about executional issues that we needed to improve and operational performance did get better. We set a high bar to execute with excellence and are making progress.\nDespite our overall results, there were strong positive highlights in the quarter that serve as proof points that our strategy is working. As you know, our branded foods business is the key growth pillar for the future, and in Q2, the business performed well. These results were driven by the strength of our share position, especially for our core brands, including Jimmy Dean, Tyson and Hillshire Farm, which helped deliver strong margins compared to the same 13-week period last year.\nWe continue to grow both pound and dollar share and to outperform our large food peers in volume based on Nielsen data. It's clear we are winning with consumers. We also continue to win with our customers. We're proud to have been moved up into the top 10 for the first time ever in the most recent Kantar Power rankings. In fact, Tyson finished in the top 10 in 6 of the 9 categories they measure.\nAs we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with [indiscernible]. While strong performance continued in our branded foods business, I know that our results in Chicken are top of mind for many of you. So I want to spend a few minutes walking through our Chicken business in detail.\nI want to point you to 3 important things on the macro environment. First, marketing conditions remain very challenging. Commodity prices for most fresh chicken cuts are much lower than last year, with boneless breast meat, tenders and wings down more than 50%. While we're not fully exposed to commodity markets, we are not immune to their dynamics. Some might expect these dynamics to impact our results immediately. But in fact, they work through on a lag. As chicken commodity prices declined in Q1, the impact continued into our Q2, while price increases we saw during the quarter are expected to affect Q3.\nSecond, input costs were higher compared to last year as our feed ingredient cost increased $145 million. We also realized an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $135 million due to volatility in commodity grain prices.\nThird, while high path avian influenza has not had a significant impact on our live operations, key export markets remain closed. While we can't control markets, we are focused on the things we can control. We made a series of strategic decisions to better position us for the future.\nFor example, we converted 2 of our plants from bone-in to boneless, specifically to add new business and to continue growing with an important customer. We further rationalized assets, SKUs and inventory. In fact, we reduced our finished inventory pounds by nearly 20% during the quarter. We also made the difficult choice earlier this quarter to close 2 of our less productive chicken plants. These strategic actions are expected to generate significant efficiencies going forward, although some of them generate incremental cost in our current results.\nDespite challenging market conditions, we continue to execute our strategy and have significant opportunities in front of us. We increased our internal production, gaining 130 basis points of harvest share compared to last year. This led to pound share gains of 250 basis points in value-added retail and 60 basis points in food service. As you can see, we are well positioned to keep growing. We continue to invest in automation and digital capabilities with opportunities to improve our yield. We now have 50 debone lines that are fully automated. We have room to optimize our cost structure and a portion of the actions we took last month are focused on this.\nImportantly, we are working more closely than ever with our customers to create value jointly. We're building long-term supply partnerships that have clear benefits for both sites. We improved order fill rates by more than 20%. This was no accident, and I'm proud of our team for accomplishing this. We're winning in the marketplace by winning with our customers.\nNow I've given you specific details on the business, I want to step back and remind you of our overall strategy. Our approach to building and growing Chicken is based on 3 key elements: first, we strive to be the best-in-class operator by executing with excellence. This includes filling our plants to continue increasing our capacity utilization. Second, we plan to grow our value-added business focusing on fully cooked in retail and food service channels and by innovating and differentiating our offerings. And third, we expect to win with consumers behind the #1 brand in Chicken and win with our customers by being their go-to supplier.\nI want to underscore that we are focused on improving our results in Chicken. We can do that by implementing our strategy leading to continued growth and improved margins and I'm confident that we have the right leadership team in place to get us there.\nNow turning to the continued strong performance of our retail branded business. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines continue to outpace total food and beverage and our peers in both sales dollars and volume growth, up 13% and 7%, respectively, compared to a year ago per Nielsen.\nOur brands continue to perform well as Tyson core business lines grew pound share by 2.4 points relative to prior year quarter. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate by more than 2 points and also across all [ dayparts ].\nAs proven by our growth compared to last year, we know that consumers will spend on categories and brands they know and trust. The trajectory of our Tyson core business lines volume share growth shows the momentum we have gained with consumers. We remain focused on maintaining our improved fill rates and on-shelf availability while investing in merchandising and advertising to support our brands, which, along with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in pound share growth increasing sequentially over the past 4 quarters.\nTyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, all hold favorite brand status with consumers by a large margin over our nearest competitor. It is evident that we're delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. As I mentioned earlier, our move into the Kantar top 10 demonstrates that we continue to gain the confidence of our customers. Winning with customers and consumers is a key priority, and it's clear we're having success with both.\nNow let me tell you why I'm so optimistic about our future. Tyson is an iconic company with a broad portfolio of products and powerful brands that has been a recognized leader in protein for nearly 90 years. We've been through market cycles before. I've been through them before myself and we've always come out stronger on the other side. We have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to do it once again. Our vision is to deliver sustainable top line growth and margin improvement. Our strategy to drive growth is built on the foundation of 3 key pillars: first, we will drive growth in our core protein platform where we harvest and process fresh meat across a diverse portfolio. We expect global demand for protein to continue to grow in the years ahead, driven by population growth and per capita income expansion. Tyson is well positioned with the capacity in place to meet demand.\nSecond, we will drive growth through our branded food portfolio. We have over 30 prepared food and snacking brands, including some of the strongest brands in all of food, namely Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. Branded Food is our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins and stronger results.\nThird, we will expand internationally where it makes sense. Most of the growth in protein consumption is expected to take place outside the U.S. We can capture this significant opportunity by scaling our existing business, expanding our customer base and exploring new markets. These pillars are enabled by our relentless focus on customers and consumers, operational excellence and digital capabilities to drive margin improvement.\nWe win customers and consumers by building growth partnerships, delivering top-tier customer service and fill rates and product innovation. We expect to realize our operational excellence goals as we modernize our operations, driving efficiencies, saving on costs and increasing throughput. And we continue to build our digital capabilities, operating at scale with digitally enabled standard operating procedures and utilizing data, automation and AI tech for decision-making.\nWith the combination of our growth strategies and focus on margin improvement, we can deliver the food that consumers love and create long-term value for our customers, for our team members and for our shareholders. We put a strong proven leadership team in place here at Tyson. I've never been more confident in the talent that we have, and I know that we have the right people to capture the opportunities in front of us. Now I'll turn things over to John to discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail.\n\nJohn R. Tyson\n\nExecutive VP of Strategy & Chief Sustainability Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donnie. First, for a quick touch on our total company financial performance and then a review of the individual segments. Total company revenue was up slightly compared to last year's previous record Q2 performance as the benefit from significant volume growth in Chicken were offset by the reduction in price per pound in Beef and in Pork. For the total company, in individually in Chicken and Prepared Foods, we continue to deliver record high sales performance now for a fifth consecutive quarter. We remain focused on driving growth in these businesses to enhance our margin profile over time.\nNow turning to profitability. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating income was driven by lower earnings in Beef and Chicken. Higher input costs per pound in all segments except Pork increased our cost of goods sold. The majority was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and labor costs. The remainder of the increase was due to a few things: inventory value adjustments, unfavorable derivative impacts and a shift producing more value-added mix and this was partially offset by savings from our productivity program, reduced outside meat purchases and Chicken and decreased supply chain costs.\nOur pricing decreased led by lower cut-out values in Beef and Pork. This was partially offset by volume growth in Chicken.\nNow let me go to the individual segment results, starting with Beef. Sales in our Beef segment decreased 8.3% compared to a record high sales in the second quarter of last year. Price was down 5.4% due to reduced domestic demand in software export markets. and volume was down 2.9% due to fewer head process. Live cattle costs increased approximately $305 million on a like-for-like volume in the quarter as the reduction in the beef cattle herd continues to tighten supply and increase competition for cattle.\nThe margin compression resulting from reduced sales and increased cattle costs led to a segment operating income of $8 million and an operating margin of 0.2%, down from the historically high second quarter margin of 12.7% last year.\nLooking next to the Pork segment. The volume gain of 1.1%, driven by improved hog availability was more than offset by the 10.3% decline in average sales price due to the soft global demand environment, leading to a decrease in overall sales of 9.2% versus the second quarter last year. The Port segment posted an operating loss of $31 million for the quarter which was driven by the industry headwinds compressing pork packing margins and inflationary pressures on operating costs.\nMoving on to the Chicken segment results. The sales increase in Chicken of 8.4% over the prior year quarter was driven by a 6.4% uptick in volume due to increased internal production. Benefits of prior period pricing actions drove 2% growth in sales despite a challenging commodity market. At a loss of $166 million, second quarter operating income was impacted adversely by market conditions and near-term impacts of strategic decisions we made that Donnie discussed earlier. Other headwinds experienced in the quarter included continuing export impacts from [ HPA ] as well as higher feed ingredient cost of $145 million and an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $135 million, including a $35 million loss in this current quarter and $100 million gain in Q2 of last year.\nThe industry operational headwinds do not change our approach, though. We expect to perform as the industry best-in-class operator while growing our internal production with our customer demand, enabling us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume and gain market share. In addition to the continuous improvement of our operations, growing the market share of our portfolio of value-added products is imperative to maximizing our profitability and our long-term strategy.\nNow lastly, to Prepared Foods, where our retail brands like Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and State Fair continue to deliver industry-leading performance, outpacing all peers in both revenue and volume growth in the quarter. Total sales revenue grew 1.2%, primarily driven by pricing gains. The slight volume decline of 0.4% was driven by softness in food service volumes as the trajectory of this channel recovery remains uneven. This was almost all offset though by the strong performance of our retail brands, driven by their category-leading position, improved supply and our [ MAP ] investments.\nCompared to the prior year period, segment operating income decreased modestly due to increased raw material costs and brand building investments. This was partially offset by productivity gains and price increases. While down slightly against the historically strong comp, we are pleased with the operating margin performance of 10.4% in this challenging macro environment. We continue to be excited for the future in Prepared Foods as the segment is critical to valuing up Beef, Pork and Chicken commodity meat products and delivering strong earnings at a time when the commodity protein segment's profitability is under pressure.\nWe will continue to unlock value by increasing plant utilization, implementing productivity initiatives, and we will grow through innovation of new offerings, expansion of our existing product portfolio and the recovery of our food service business.\nNow to our financial position and capital priorities, we're building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy.\nFirst, let me spend a minute talking about our financial policy and long-term capital allocation and provide a bit more color around our approach to CapEx deployment. Our financial policy remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA for the long term. Our capital allocation prioritizes investing in our business through CapEx as well as strategic and disciplined M&A while also returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAs owner-operators, our approach to CapEx is simple and effective, we support our maintenance CapEx needs and then we focus on growth and profit optimization, investing in opportunities that generate the greatest returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We don't expect our total CapEx this year to exceed $2.3 billion, which is down from our prior guidance of at or around $2.5 billion.\nNow moving on from CapEx, during Q2, we returned $167 million to shareholders through dividends and $19 million in share repurchases. We have increased our dividend for 11 consecutive years and remain committed to supporting our dividend. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 2.4x.\nLast week, we entered into a new term loan agreement for $1.75 billion to further enhance our liquidity. These funds will be used to pay off our existing commercial paper that's outstanding and some upcoming bond maturities and also to fund our investments in the business, including the pending acquisition of Williams Sausage, which will support our strategic focus on branded retail growth.\nWe remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nNow let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. Based on performance year-to-date and a moderating outlook for revenue growth, we are lowering our total company sales guidance to $53 billion to $54 billion or flat to 1% growth for the year. In our Beef segment, based on the deterioration in current market dynamics, we now expect margins to be between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1% for the fiscal year. Also, due to challenging market dynamics this time in our Pork segment, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between a loss of 2% and breakeven.\nIn Chicken, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%. Based on our results so far in April, we anticipate Q3 margins to be roughly breakeven as we gain momentum and exit the fourth quarter at or above the high end of the full year range.\nIn the second quarter, Prepared Foods continued its strong performance, resulting in a first half margin above the guided range for the fiscal year. So we are maintaining that at 8% to 10%, driven by historical seasonality and continued brand support. And in our International business, we remain committed to expanding globally in the fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Driven by continued year-over-year volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up, we are confident of our improved profitability in fiscal 2023, with stronger quarterly performance in the back half of the year compared to Q2.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx to approximately $2.3 billion. And our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $340 million and 22%, respectively.\nIn summary, the first half was challenging and many of the headwinds experienced are likely to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. Although the current operating environment has proven to be difficult, we view this as an opportunity to grow and improve our business operations, and we are optimistic on our long-term value driver prospects. We have great leadership and operational teams, growing demand for our products, robust portfolio diversity and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders. So now, let me turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Thanks, Sean."

For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter 2023 results. We delivered solid top-line results with year-over-year revenue and volume growth and continued strength in our share position, providing momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year. Compared to record performance in the prior year first quarter earnings declined driven by weaker results in chicken, pork and beef, which more than offset strong performance in Prepared Foods.\nIt's important for you to know that we are uniquely positioned to win in an attractive global protein market. We have market-leading brands across diverse portfolio that resonate with consumers has proven by our year-over-year sales and volume growth. We serve an estimated 1/5 of U.S. protein consumption, and we are well positioned to meet consumer demand, which remains steady despite a challenging macroeconomic environment with ongoing elevated levels of inflation. As we navigate a complex and dynamic operating environment, I'm grateful for our team members whose hard work and dedication make our business operations possible.\nFive key pillars of our strategy are: transforming our team member experience; growing with our customers to service demand; investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence; restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment; and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders.\nIn service of these long-term strategic imperatives, I'd like to emphasize that we continue to deliver on our commitment of growing volume by filling up our footprint, solving labor problems, investing in automation and building inventory to meet customer demand with improved fill rates all while maintaining a focus on liquidity and financial health. We are confident these investments will pay dividends over the long run, and we remain committed to methodically executing our growth strategy driving long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nNow let me take a moment to discuss our results and shed some light on some of the challenges and outlook. We went into Q1 with a good plan, but our overall results were impacted by a confluence of factors, including consumer and customer demand dynamics and the curve of the Beef cycle, among other things. Allow me to touch on each segment.\nAs we have previously mentioned to you, we have been expecting Beef to come under pressure for some time. With higher cattle prices, we expected overall harvest to slow down, but that hasn't happened yet. As such, we continue to draw on the herd, which continues to decline. This is putting pressure on spread margin in the business. We tightened our outlook range for the year. For Pork, when you account for mark-to-market derivatives in the number, we flip back to breakeven as expected, but given continued supply and demand dynamics, we lowered our outlook for the year by 200 basis points. For Chicken, when compared to expectations from last quarter, a few different things didn't go as planned. Most notably, demand didn't appear in the parts of the market where we had expected. As a result, we had to move things around, and we experienced higher cost, a lower price environment and knock-on effects from a network standpoint. And last, it's worth emphasizing our Prepared Foods segment, which delivered a great result for the quarter.\nWe said we were going to grow dollar share and volume share with the strongest portfolio of brands in the categories where we compete and we've done just that. We're feeling good about the outlook for the balance of the year. And our International business continues to build momentum in terms of volume and sales growth. With the end of COVID lockdowns, particularly in China, we expect good year-over-year comps. We'll dive deeper into this during the discussion of segment results and the Q&A portion of the call.\nNow let's turn to our growth numbers. Sales improved 2.5% year-over-year. And as we delivered record first quarter revenue for a total company and individually in Chicken, Prepared Foods and International Other, we are focused on driving growth in these segments, which will enhance our margin profile over time. We continue to see benefits of our efforts to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs.\nPrepared Foods revenues increased 8.8% for the quarter, driven by both volume growth and pricing actions implemented in the prior year. Positive momentum continues to build in Prepared Foods, as it delivered sequential quarterly improvement in revenue since the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. Beef revenue was down 5.6% compared to prior year. Lower average sales price driven by the decreased value of Beef cutout more than offset the increased volume from higher headcount throughput. Compared to prior year, Pork revenue was down 6% for the quarter, this was driven by decreased volume due to balancing supply with customer demand, partly offset by an increase in average sales price.\nChicken revenue increased 9.6% compared to prior year, driven by volume growth from increased domestic production and pricing initiatives and an elevated inflationary cost environment. In International, revenue growth remained strong, up 11.3% compared to prior year quarter. This was driven by our investment in capacity, innovation and brand to support market share growth.\nIn the next few slides, we will detail our success winning in retail marketplace with our advantaged brands in advantaged categories. The retail categories in which we participate are highly consumer-relevant with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre-pandemic and demonstrating growth over the prior year. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson; Jimmy Dean; Hillshire Farm; and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in volume growth, up 9% relative to a year ago per Nielsen. Tyson core business lines also grew pound share by 2 points this quarter relative to a year ago per Nielsen. Continuing to be market share leader in most of the retail core categories in which we compete, we delivered both dollar and pound share growth in both the aggregate and across day parts compared to a year ago, most notably in the Morning Meal occasion.\nOur brands continue to perform well as we see elasticities below historical levels. Additionally, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete, highlighting our brand strength relative to our peers. Consumers spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. The trajectory of our Tyson core business lines' volume share growth shows the recovery we have seen since April and the momentum we now have. We have improved fill rates and on-shelf availability.\nPrice gaps relative to competitors have narrowed while we continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands. These factors, along with other strong business fundamentals resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in Tyson core business lines commanding a 5-year record high market share of nearly 28%. It is evident we are delivering the brands and products that consumers desire.\nWhile the foodservice industry is yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is outperforming pre-pandemic volume sales, up 2.7 and 1.7 share points in the latest 52 weeks according to NPD SupplyTrack data. The Tyson Focus 6 group is also outpacing both total broadline and its respective categories up 11.7% in volume sales and 0.6 share points in the latest 52 weeks compared to last year per NPD. We believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident in the path to continue to grow this business as we align with key growing customers to build momentum for the future.\nOur team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers demand. We're seeing business results from making significant investments to become the most sought-after place to work by investing in our team members' experience. Recent highlights include expanding access to benefits with day 1 eligibility, enhanced parental leave policies, expanding mental health benefits and citizenship support at no cost to our U.S. team members. In November, as recognition for our Tyson immigration program's commitment to improving the lives of immigrant team members, we received the prestigious keeper of the American Dream Award from the National Immigration Forum. We also just completed what we've been calling Project Next Frontier. We are setting the foundation for an HR shared service model focused on process and system efficacy and better overall HR service delivery for our team members, setting us up for savings in the future.\nI am pleased to report we're also progressing as expected with our North American headquarters consolidation focused on building our One Tyson culture. In addition to realizing savings, we are collaborating, innovating and working with greater speed and agility to serve our customers. I would also like to thank our team members for their dedication that led to Tyson Foods #1 ranking on Fortune Magazine's list of the world's most admired companies in food production category for the seventh consecutive year.\nFollowing the strong outperformance of expectation in fiscal 2022, the productivity program is on track to meet expectations this fiscal year and to deliver the $1 billion of recurring savings' commitment a year earlier than originally promised. We expect this program to translate from a onetime initiative to sustain year-on-year productivity improvements, supporting our bottom line on a continued basis. Examples of initiatives in our productivity program include leveraging data analytics to improve inventory visibility; mitigating distressed pounds; a direct plant shipment program, which continues to bring on new customers and categories; removing miles from the roads and driving efficiency in our distribution network, this is an example of how our scale drives competitive advantage, investing heavily in automation, we recently rolled out automated sandwich hand-wrap and burrito assembly capabilities as well as an automated line to serve snacking production.\nWe have also continued to scale our Chicken debone automation across multiple facilities, and we are piloting a robotic tray pack machine that is showing promising results, expanding our Smart Factory program to digitize our plants to new sites as well as exploring opportunities to digitize our processes. Our progress displays how Tyson remains focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing the supply chain, increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations.\nBefore I turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the quarter, some final comments. Our segments individually and in aggregate, have clear and compelling roles within Tyson's portfolio strategy to deliver sustainable, high-quality growth at good value. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins and channels around the world. We have products for consumers across proteins and price points, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings' objectives and desirable return for shareholders. We are modernizing our operations with our productivity program and are building a team positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us.\nAgain, we entered Q1 with a good plan to execute our strategy. That led to solid top-line growth and strong performance in Prepared Foods. Market dynamics and some operational inefficiencies impacted our profitability. We see opportunities to become more agile and efficient, which will further improve our operational execution. We remain committed to executing our growth strategy and are confident we will grow volume, revenue and operating income in the back half of fiscal year 2023 and have a long runway of growth ahead of us.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn R. Tyson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donnie. First, let's review a summary of our total company financial performance, then we can dive deeper into the details for the individual segments. As Donnie stated, sales were up year-over-year for the first quarter, benefiting from both volume growth and disciplined revenue management to offset elevated inflationary increases in our cost of goods.\nLooking at our sales results by channel, retail drove $324 million of top-line improvement led by Chicken and Prepared Foods. Our industrial and other channel sales increased by $108 million, led by Beef and Chicken and this was offset by slight decreases in sales to the foodservice and International channels. As expected, given the record strength of Beef a year ago, we delivered lower adjusted operating income in the prior year of $453 million. This translated to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.85.\nNow turning to the adjusted operating income bridge. We significantly grew Prepared Foods earnings in the quarter, but underperformance in Chicken, Pork and Beef led to $979 million lower operating income compared to the prior year. While pricing actions led to an improvement of $222 million, higher input costs per pound increased cost of goods sold by $1.3 billion. About 2/3 of this increase was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and supply chain costs. The remainder was primarily due to a shift to producing more value-added mix, higher labor costs and unfavorable derivative impact. Excluding the impact of restructuring, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was down to 3.7% from 4.3% in the prior fiscal year as we continue to eliminate non-value-added spend across our business while investing to support the future growth of our brands. Our productivity program continues to play a critical role in the long-term improvement of our margin profile.\nNow to the individual segment results. Starting with the Beef segment. Sales in the quarter remained strong at more than $4.7 billion but were down 5.6% compared to record high sales in the prior year. Volume gains of 2.9% were supported by improved staffing for higher throughput, while the average sales price was down 8.5% due to softer domestic demand for Beef. Live cattle costs increased approximately $530 million in the quarter as capital supplies continue to tighten. Net-net, segment operating income for Beef was $129 million for an operating margin of 2.7% off the previous year's historical record first quarter margin of 19%.\nWe saw higher cattle prices as Beef herd numbers continue to decline. We will continue to monitor the Beef cutout value and balance our supply with customer demand during a period of margin compression while pushing volume growth in case-ready and premium branded products. Although the near-term operating environment remains challenging, we have reasons to believe in our long-term outlook for Beef. This outlook is supported by our investment in strategic supplier relationships that provide higher quality beef, a growing global demand, specifically in Asia, and the strengthening drop credit as well as opportunities to shift our Beef products up the value pyramid.\nNow let's look at the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.5 billion for the quarter, down 6% for the record high in the prior year. Average sales price gains of 1.4%, mostly driven by higher value specialty products were offset by volume decreases of 7.4%. International demand for U.S. pork products continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, while domestic demand is being affected by high retail prices despite the cutout realigning to historical norms. However, we are optimistic that when these factors normalize, demand will improve. We expect to see continued industry supply challenges in the fiscal year as the producer navigates herd health issues and higher input costs. On expenses, we incurred greater costs as lean hog costs increased approximately $55 million over the prior year.\nWe also experienced an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of $35 million. Segment operating income was lower than expected at a loss of $19 million for the quarter, down from a profit of $160 million in the prior year. As we move forward, Pork margins should be supported over time with the normalization and the strength of the U.S. dollar aiding future export demand, a strengthening drop credit and additional opportunity to shift Pork products up the value pyramid, especially into our case-ready business.\nNow let's move on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were a record first quarter high at $4.3 billion, up 9.6% from the prior year. The sales increase was attributable to a 2.5% uptick in volume and 7.1% gain in pricing compared to the prior year quarter. Volume gains are due to a combination of strategic choices to maximize our capacity utilization and pursue an optimal mix strategy with products and customers. Our pricing results while improved, were lower than expected. We pegged this to a combination of factors that influence chicken prices, mostly related to total protein availability, notably chicken and beef. We anticipate these factors easing in the back half of 2023 as beef availability lessen and total poultry harvest normalizes, providing support for improvement in our chicken prices. The fall in commodity chicken prices driven by heightened protein supply in the market and seasonal demand weakness does not change our strategy.\nBased on current USDA industry pullet placement data, we're optimistic on the forward-looking supply conditions in the intermediate term. We intend to grow our domestic production to 42 million head per week during this fiscal year, which should enable us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume and gain market share. We'll continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our Chicken segment, particularly by growing our portfolio of value-added products, which remain in high demand. Operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $225 million of higher feed ingredient costs and an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $40 million. Net-net, our Chicken segment delivered operating income of $77 million in the first quarter.\nWe see significant room for improvement in the long-term operating margin of our Chicken segment as there is still work to do to attain industry-leading performance, and we are optimistic it can be achieved due to the following: our diversified value-added portfolio with lower margin volatility; our brand strength with the highest consumer awareness and brand loyalty according to Nielsen data; our growth strategy; taking advantage of existing capacity; optimization of our portfolio by shifting from commodity to value-added products; and last, a further implementation of our productivity program as we ramp up more automation.\nLast, I want to turn to our Prepared Foods business. In this segment, we had a solid quarter with growth in both revenue and volume. This was driven by strong brands, increased support for our customers and pricing aimed at recovering the continued inflation. Revenue was approximately $2.5 billion for a record first quarter, up 8.8% compared to the prior year. Volume gains of 1.2% were driven by strength in retail, notably Jimmy Dean and improved customer fulfillment despite decreased volumes in foodservice. This quarter was our third sequential quarter of volume growth, and we saw significant pricing power of our portfolio with a year-over-year increase of 7.6%. Driven by top-line growth and productivity savings, we delivered segment operating income of $266 million for the quarter. The operating margin of 10.5% was up from 8% in the prior year. We're very pleased with the performance of this quarter in Prepared Foods, as this segment is critical to drive profitable growth for Tyson by valuing of Beef, Pork and Chicken commodity meat products.\nWe continue to be optimistic for the outlook of this segment due to the following: our diversified portfolio meets consumers across meal eating occasions and snacking occasions in all sales channels; we are outperforming our competition in retail with a room to grow further market household penetration; our comprehensive foodservice portfolio has opportunity to grow by regaining lost customers and broadening our customer base; we've got additional operational efficiencies to unlock by increasing plant utilization in addition to the implementation of our various productivity initiatives; and finally, we have an opportunity to innovate, expand and acquire into new spaces through new offerings, the growth of our existing products and attractive disciplined approach to M&A.\nNow, turning to talk about our financial position. Building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. We produced operating cash flows of $762 million for the quarter, and our leverage ratio finished the quarter at 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our commitment to a sound balance sheet. Focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives, we invested nearly $600 million into our business in the first quarter to capitalize on projected demand growth over the next decade. Investment in the business, both organically and inorganically, is expected to generate returns at or above our 12% return on invested capital target over time. Our capital allocation priorities are first to invest in growth and productivity in our existing footprint. Then we will employ a disciplined M&A approach by investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio.\nNext, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we will continue to support and grow the dividend for our shareholders as evidenced by its continuous payment since 1977 and annual increases each fiscal year since 2013.\nOur approach to share buybacks will continue to be managing for dilution and entering the market opportunistically when assessing for multiple factors. We returned nearly $500 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter through $169 million in dividends and $313 million of share repurchases. At Tyson, we utilize a disciplined capital allocation approach to invest in our business for both organic and inorganic growth, and we returned cash to shareholders while maintaining a robust balance sheet.\nNow let's turn to the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $55 billion to $57 billion, which implies a 3% to 7% sales growth for the year. Supported by the factors detailed earlier, we expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% in the long term. However, based on current market dynamics, we now expect to perform between 2% and 4% this fiscal year. Given the result in Pork in the first quarter, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between 0% and 2%. Counter to normal seasonality for our Pork segment, we expect the back half of the year to outperform the first half of the year.\nFor our Poultry business, we now expect full year margins to be between 2% and 4%, but gaining momentum through the year and exiting the fourth quarter at a margin above this range. Prepared Foods had a strong first quarter in performance as this is historically normal seasonality for the segment, we're maintaining our expected full year margin performance to be between 8% and 10%. In International, we continue to see volume and sales growth year-over-year, and we anticipate improved profitability in fiscal 2023, driven by volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up. We remain committed to growing our business internationally, representing the fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world.\nOur expectation for CapEx for the remainder of the year is unchanged at approximately $2.5 billion. Our expectations for productivity savings remain unchanged at $300 million to $400 million. Our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $330 million and 24%, respectively. We remain committed to our investment-grade rating and managing our net leverage ratio to be at or below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the long term, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders.\nIn summary, we had a slower start than expected, but are optimistic on the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and long term. We have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity and a differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. Overall, we see some persistent market factors, some operational challenges and some expected seasonality influencing our second quarter results. And therefore, we're expecting total company volume, revenue and operating income to be meaningfully stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. We remain in a strong financial position to support continued investment in our existing footprint, productivity and the support of our brands as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders.\nSo with all that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Tucker, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Tucker\n\nHello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call for Tyson Foods. Prepared remarks today will be provided by Donnie King, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John R. Tyson, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Shane Miller, Group President, Fresh Meats; Stewart Glendinning, Group President, Prepared Foods; David Bray, Group President, Poultry; and Amy Tu, Group President, International and CAO, will join the live Q&A session.

These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause our actual results to differ materially from our current projections. Please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on Slide 2 as well as our SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections.

For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\nI will now turn the call over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we announced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2022 results. We showed record annual financial performance, including revenue, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team members. Our results would not have been possible without them.\nIn this challenging macroeconomic environment with historically high inflation, consumer demand for protein remains relatively steady. We remain well positioned to serve this demand. We leveraged our diverse protein portfolio across multiple channels and brands to meet customer and consumer needs across a broad range of products and price points, serving an estimated 1/5 of U.S. protein consumption. And as proven by our double-digit sales growth, our portfolio of value-added and branded products positions us uniquely to win.\nIn addition to growing sales, we are also aggressively mitigating inflationary cost and SG&A expenses through a disciplined revenue management and enterprise-wide productivity actions, including investments in automation to improve operational excellence and efficiency. As we progress our efforts to be the most sought-after place to work, we continue to listen to our team members' needs and invest in areas like childcare to provide a better quality of life for our team members. We're beginning to see results from these investments through improved staffing levels and reduced turnover.\nBefore I discuss our financial performance, let me provide a bit of strategic context. As you are well aware, we have a strong and disciplined strategic growth plan. In this past year, we continue to methodically execute against this plan as we strengthened our position as a global protein leader. Our growth strategy is built on 5 key pillars: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service demand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders.\nI'm pleased to report that we have executed on each of these imperatives and delivered what we said we would entering the fiscal year. Our commitment to strengthening our position as a global protein leader and driving value creation for our shareholders is the most important goal for our team.\nHaving the right leadership team in place is also imperative as a global protein leader. To accomplish this, we recently announced changes in our executive leadership team, which we believe will drive improved results across our organization. Overall, we feel good about our performance. We saw a lot of really good things. We delivered record sales, revenue and earnings. The Chicken turnaround progressed as promised. Beef performed better than expected, and Prepared Foods is seeing positive volume momentum exiting the year.\nWith that strategic context, let's turn to our financial performance. Compared to our initial fiscal year guidance, we exceeded our total company sales and Beef margin guidance, and we met guidance on Chicken and Prepared Foods margins. We managed our balance sheet and sit today at a leverage ratio comfortably below our guidance. Sales improved 7% for the fourth quarter and 13% year-over-year. We delivered record sales revenue as a company and across each of our 4 largest operating segments.\nWe delivered record annual adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion, up 3% over the prior year. As expected, our fourth quarter earnings were lower compared to the prior year, but this was almost entirely due to record strength in Beef a year ago. Our operating income performance translated to adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 for the fourth quarter and a record $8.73 for the full year, up 5% from last year.\nTurning to our results on volume. We're continuing to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. We saw benefits of our efforts in the fourth quarter as total company volume increased 2.1%. We are building positive momentum and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to grow volumes across all segments long term.\nChicken volumes increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year driven by increased domestic production. In Prepared Foods, volumes were relatively flat in the quarter compared to the prior year. We are gaining momentum delivering sequential quarterly improvement driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. The categories in which we play continue to be highly consumer-relevant with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre pandemic. In a few slides, we'll discuss our strong share performance.\nCompared to prior year, Beef volumes were up 5.1% for the quarter, driven by higher head throughput and carcass weights, improving from a full year volume deficit of 1.5% in the third quarter. We finished the year relatively flat. Pork volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter compared to prior year due to limited hog supply and reduced export demand. In International, volumes continue to grow, up 7.3% compared to the prior year quarter driven by our investments in capacity, innovations and brands that support market share growth.\nAs we look ahead, one thing that excites me is the momentum I see in our branded retail business. It is evident that we are delivering the brands and the products that consumers want. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in growth, up 18% in volume sales in the last 13 weeks compared to prepandemic levels per Nielsen data.\nAccording to Nielsen data, Tyson core business lines grew volume share by 2.6 points this quarter compared to prepandemic levels while also growing share relative to a year ago. We continue to be the market share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete while also gaining share in 7 of these 9 core categories. We experienced the greatest share gains in frozen protein breakfast, smoked sausage and corn dog category. Our brand strength relative to our peers is undeniable as Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete.\nMany of our retail businesses continue to outperform total food and beverage and remain highly relevant to consumers and therefore, elevated in consumption. Consumers will continue to spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. This data shows the recovery we're seeing versus a year ago and the momentum we are gaining as we move into fiscal 2023.\nWe have made steady progress improving fill rates and on-shelf availability as we focus on serving our current customers and attracting new customers to grow our distribution and volume. Additionally, we took various degrees of pricing in our key categories earlier this fiscal year to offset inflationary cost pressures. Recently, we have seen competitors follow by increasing their prices, nearing Tyson's price gap relative to our competitors. This is supporting improved volume performance across our portfolio of prepared foods products as we are continuing to see price elasticities remain below historical levels.\nWe're investing strategically in merchandising and advertising to support the long-term health of our brands as their strength enables continued growth in both dollar and volume retail share. These factors, along with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in many of our key retail category, and we expect our retail share growth to continue.\nWhile the foodservice industry has yet to recover to prepandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is outpacing both total broadline and respective categories and volume sales, up 18.9% and 0.9 share points in the last 52 weeks compared to last year according to NPD's SupplyTrack data. The Tyson Focus 6 group, composed of value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon and Philly steak, is also up 1.7 volume share points in the last 52 weeks compared to prepandemic levels.\nWe believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident there is immediate and long-term growth ahead of this business as we align with key growing customers and execute our strategy across all categories to build momentum for the future.\nOur team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers demand. Staffing levels and the impact on operational throughput were a challenge in our business. We continue to make significant investments in our team members' experience, prioritizing these 3 key areas of health, safety and well-being of our team members, total rewards and team member growth and our One Tyson culture with digitalization as a key enabler. We're now seeing business results from investing in becoming the most sought-after place to work.\nExamples of these investments are free education, childcare solutions, citizenship support, transportation, maternity and paternity leave and expanded mental health and well-being benefits. In August, we received national recognition for our innovative ridesharing program benefiting team members across the nation. The program provides an option for team members who may have difficulty accessing reliable transportation to get to work and thus improving their quality of life.\nInvestments in enhanced benefits, digitalized processes and tools and career growth opportunities for our team members are paying off. In October, we announced our One Tyson corporate office consolidation to world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. The move will enable excellence and execution by bringing our corporate business unit roles together on one campus, driving a culture that optimize collaboration, innovation, accelerate speed and facilitates career growth for our team members. The feedback we've received from our customers for this change has been well received.\nThese investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from an environmental, social and governance perspective. Today, we are focused on 3 core pillars of our ESG framework, the formula to feed the future. Those 3 pillars are reimagining people and community impact, driving product responsibility from farm to table and working toward achieving net zero.\nIn July, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition to become the world's most sustainable and transparent protein company. In addition to the investments in people mentioned, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, minimizing waste, water stewardship and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce emissions.\nSignificant progress was achieved in the past fiscal year in improving our scores and metrics within ESG rating agencies. We are particularly proud of a more than 30% increase in our Dow Jones Sustainability Index score year-over-year, and we're taking more steps to continue to improve our standing with ESG stakeholders.\nIn the past fiscal year, our productivity program outperformed on our commitments, delivering over $700 million in savings impact across all components of our business. This performance indicates how Tyson has remained focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing our supply chain and increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations.\nWe expect the productivity program will continue to outperform our original expectations of more than $1 billion in recurring savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. The program is now on track to deliver this commitment by the end of fiscal year 2023, a year earlier than expected. As mentioned before, these recurring savings support the partial offset of inflationary pressures while at the same time, improving our competitiveness in the marketplace.\nAutomation remains a top priority, and I'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation technologies across all segments in fiscal year 2022, including continuing to scale debone automation in our poultry operations and pack-out automation across all businesses.\nI will now turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the fourth quarter.\n\nJohn R. Tyson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're pleased to report resilient fourth quarter and record annual performance in the fiscal year. Sales were up for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in cost of goods. Volumes were up for the fourth quarter and relatively flat for the full year as we overcame supply constraints in an elevated inflationary environment pressuring consumer demand.\nLooking at our sales results by channel for the fiscal year. Retail drove $1.4 billion of top line improvement, while the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $2 billion. Fiscal year sales in international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products, were $1.3 billion greater than the prior year as we leverage our global scale to grow our business. Donnie covered our operating income and earnings per share results, so I won't repeat.\nSlide 16 bridges operating income for the fiscal year, which was $126 million greater than the fiscal 2021. We significantly improved earnings in our Chicken segment and generated higher earnings in Prepared Foods, which more than offset the expected decline in Beef earnings. Our pricing actions, which offset the higher input costs, led to higher sales during the year. We saw notable year-over-year increases of 20% to 25% across the business in cost of goods, including labor, feed ingredients, live animals and freight costs.\nInvestment in growth is our priority. To facilitate this growth, an additional $80 million in SG&A expenses compared to last fiscal year was invested in team members, marketing, advertising and promotional spend to support our brand and digitalization initiatives, among other things. While SG&A expenses increased, SG&A as a percentage of total sales was down to 4.2% from 4.5% in the prior fiscal year, reflecting our continued focus on assessing all expenses across the business to identify non-value-added spend and continuing to build leverage across the scale of our business.\nAs mentioned by Donnie, we significantly accelerated our productivity actions to improve efficiency across all segments during the past year, which has had a meaningful positive impact on our margin profile. Our year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports our growth objectives of growing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders.\nNow moving to the Beef segment. Sales were approximately $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3% versus the same period last year, but up 10% for the fiscal year at nearly $20 billion. Sales in the quarter remained strong, supported by higher volume, but offset by lower average sales price. Global consumer demand for beef products remains strong. We expect volumes to remain stable next year amid tightening supply of cattle, offset by improved labor participation, supporting higher plant productivity.\nOn expenses, we incurred greater costs during the fiscal year compared to the prior year as live cattle costs increased approximately $2 billion. But we have sufficient livestock available to finish the year, and we continue to have ample supply to support our operations.\nWe delivered segment operating income of $2.5 billion for the year, and our fiscal year operating margin of 12.5% was a very strong performance by historical standards. We still expect future beef margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% over the long term.\nLooking next to the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter and $6.4 billion for the fiscal year, down 3% and up 2%, respectively, versus the prior year. Global demand remains challenged by high domestic retail prices and the strong U.S. dollar, making U.S. pork relatively expensive as compared to alternative sources globally. For the year, the average sales price increased 4.1%, offsetting the decrease in volume of 1.9%. We expect these headwinds to impact pork volumes next year to a lesser extent than the past year.\nSegment operating income and margins were $198 million and 3.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year. The operating income deterioration was driven by herd health issues negatively impacting hog costs and a constrained cutout compressing pork margins in the elevated inflationary environment, increasing operating costs overall. While the Q4 result was negative operating income, we do expect to flip back to positive returns in Q1.\nMoving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 12% relative to the same period last year. For the fiscal year, sales increased 9.4%, driven by the higher average sales price increase of 13.5%, partially offset by the volume decline of 4.1%, in which 0.9% of the decline was due to the sale of our pet treats business.\nVolume performance improved in the fourth quarter as our investments in brands and merchandising drove an increase in portfolio market share. Our fourth quarter result, which was roughly flat versus last year, was our strongest performance this year and better than the competition, which underscores the strength of our brands. We expect volume to grow sequentially next year driven by foodservice recovery, improved supply and continued investment in our brands.\nOperating margin for the segment was 5.8% or $147 million for the quarter, up 4.1% compared to last year. For the fiscal year, our operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.5% compared to the prior year at $782 million.\nNow on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.6 billion for the quarter, up 19%. And for the full year, sales were up 24% at $17 billion. Volumes improved both for the quarter and fiscal year as we gained momentum in the improvement of our live operations. We expect this operational improvement to continue driving sequential quarterly volume growth into next fiscal year.\nAverage sales price increased by approximately 18% for both the quarter and the fiscal year compared to last year. Our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures, allowing us to be more agile in response to market conditions, was a key decision by our management team.\nChicken delivered operating income of $337 million or 7.3% for the fourth quarter and $926 million or 5.5% margin for the total fiscal year. Respectively, this represents margin improvement of 10.2% and 5.3% over the prior year comparable periods. This quarter, we surpassed our goal of processing 40 million head per week by the end of the fiscal year.\nWe intend to continue to grow next year to 42 million head per week, enabling us to maximize our fixed cost leverage and grow market share along with our value-added business. With live operations on a positive trajectory, we will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our Chicken segment.\nI am pleased with the tremendous progress we have made against our road map to restoring competitiveness in this business. However, there's still work to do to attain industry-leading performance, and I look forward to more great things to come from the team on this one.\nNow turning to Slide 20. Our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support our disciplined capital allocation approach with a focus on total shareholder return. We remain focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members and business and returning cash to shareholders. We produced $2.7 billion of operating cash flows in fiscal year '22. This is after funding a $2.1 billion increase in working capital, which included an investment of $1 billion in inventory to better service our customers as well as the impact of cost inflation.\nAdditionally, we had other planned working capital outflows associated with taxes paid on the divestiture of our pet treats business, payment of a portion of deferred payroll taxes from the CARES Act and the settlement of certain legal accruals.\nOur leverage ratio finished the year at 1.3x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority as we utilize a disciplined capital allocation and balance sheet management approach to invest in desirable projects, brands, categories and geographies.\nWe also maintain a disciplined M&A approach, investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio or our growth objectives, such as the recent acquisition in Saudi Arabia providing access to the growing halal market. While M&A will always be a consideration for growth, we're focused first on investing in growth in our existing footprint. This will facilitate Tyson increasing production capacity, market capabilities and profitability, providing return on capital generation above the market and at a minimum of 12% return on invested capital for our shareholders as our long-term target. To address projected demand growth over the next decade, we invested $1.9 billion in our business in the past fiscal year, focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives.\nFinally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. For the fiscal year, we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through $653 million in dividends and $702 million of share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return.\nLet's now discuss the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We anticipate total company sales between $55 billion and $57 billion and also expect volume growth compared to the prior fiscal year. Both total company sales and volume growth in fiscal '23 will largely be driven by our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses as we work to run our plants full, optimizing our existing footprint and utilizing new capacity expansions.\nTo grow volumes in our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses, construction is in progress of 6 new plants, all to be in operation by the end of fiscal 2023. We're building a value-added chicken plant in Danville, Virginia, and we're growing our bacon business with a new location in Bowling Green, Kentucky. And we're also expanding our footprint and increasing volumes outside the U.S. with 3 plants going live in China and one in Malaysia during 2023.\nThese investments and the recently announced joint venture partnerships are fueling future growth, both organically and inorganically in our international business. We remain focused on growing internationally and on those fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world.\nNow as we touched on earlier, our productivity program is expected to deliver an additional $300 million to $400 million of savings during fiscal 2023 as we build upon the foundation laid across the enterprise this year with focus on operational and functional excellence, digital solutions and programmatic automation initiatives. To continue to capitalize upon the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect to increase CapEx spending to approximately $2.5 billion during fiscal 2023 to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles.\nWe currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%, and we anticipate net interest expense of approximately $320 million. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our minimum target, and net leverage is expected to remain below 2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We expect strong and meaningfully better operating cash flows in fiscal 2023 as we do not expect to invest as much in working capital as experienced in the past fiscal year.\nNow finally, let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to our total company performance. As mentioned earlier, we continue to expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% for the long term. However, based on current market dynamics, we expect fiscal 2023 to be at or below the low end of that range.\nIn Pork, we expect return on sales between 2% and 4%. Due to normal seasonality for our Pork segment, we expect the front half of the year to outperform the back half of the year. We continue to invest behind our expanded case-ready capacity, increasing volume through organic growth with new and existing customers, underpinned by product innovation for both our Beef and Pork segments.\nPrepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal 2023 between 8% and 10%, driven by volume growth, productivity and disciplined revenue management. We expect volume, sales revenue and operating income to all increase through the fiscal year with stronger quarters in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.\nIn Chicken, our operational turnaround progress as forecasted, and we are now increasing our focus on optimizing our mix to maximize profitability of our value-added portfolio. We expect to deliver full year margins of 6% to 8% driven primarily by progressively growing volume and sales revenue while at the same time realizing additional operational improvements. And in International, we anticipate improved profitability from our operations in fiscal 2023, driven by volume growth from capacity expansions ramping up.\nOur segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within Tyson's portfolio strategy. We make products that provide options for consumers across proteins and up and down the value chain, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and desirable returns for shareholders.\nTo sum it up, fiscal 2022 was a record year in revenue, operating income and EPS. And as a result, we are in a strong financial position as we enter fiscal 2023 to support continued investment in our existing footprint, new capacity expansion, more automation and support for our brands as we continue to grow our business.\nNow before I turn the call over for your questions, I want to take a moment to address an important issue. I'm sure you've seen the news about the recent incident involving me. I'm embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my actions. I also want to apologize to our investors as I have to our employees. This was an incident inconsistent with our company values as well as my personal values. I just wanted you guys to hear this directly from me and to know that I'm committed to making sure this never happens again.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Donnie. Donnie?\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I would like to take a moment to make one final point. Like John, the company takes this matter seriously. Tyson Foods has a strong, robust corporate governance process. Our independent Board of Directors are overseeing a thorough review of this matter, and I'm confident in this independent process.\nWith this said, and before I turn the call back over to Brandon for your questions, I'd like to remind you that 2022 was a record year for sales, for operating income as well as EPS, and we look forward to a strong 2023.\n\nBrandon Tucker\n\nThanks, Donnie. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions."

(Operator Instructions) Please also note today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Brandon Tucker, Senior Manager. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Tucker\n\nHello, and welcome to the third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call for Tyson Foods. Prepared remarks today will be provided by Donnie King, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stewart Glendinning, EVP and Chief Financial Officer.

For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\nI will now turn the call over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we reported solid third quarter and year-to-date results. We continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic operating environment, and I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team members. Our results would not have been possible without them.\nAt our Investor Day last year, we shared 3 priorities with you: winning with team members, winning with customers and consumers and winning with execution. And I'm pleased to say that we're making progress. For team members, our continuing investments are reducing turnover and improving staffing levels. For customers, our service levels are improving. Our execution, we're getting stronger, driving substantial savings and improving business results. I'm confident we're on the right track and recognize that there is more work to do.\nLet me cover some highlights from the quarter. Our multi-protein portfolio enabled our business results. In the third quarter versus last year, we delivered substantially improved earnings in our Chicken segment as well as higher earnings in Prepared Foods, which partially offset a decline in Beef and Pork earnings, and we continued to accelerate our productivity actions to improve efficiency across all segments.\nWith our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage, up 13% in the last 13 weeks compared to prepandemic levels. We continue to be the market share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete. While gaining share in both bacon and breakfast sausage in 6 of the 9 core business lines, we grew share versus our second quarter. I was also pleased to see continued growth in our e-commerce channel, where approximately 1 in 5 U.S. households bought a Tyson product during the past quarter with e-commerce sales growing 15% versus last year.\nWe're seeing some recovery in the foodservice channel with continued gains in quarterly sales. In broadline distribution, we have seen specific strength in branded value-added chicken, breakfast sausage and bacon. In this challenging economic environment, where our cost of goods has continued to increase, consumer demand for protein remains relatively steady. Our diverse portfolio allows us to meet customer and consumer needs across a broad range of products and price points even as consumers shift between proteins and products.\nOur balance sheet grew stronger, providing optionality to invest in growth across our portfolio and return cash to shareholders. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on total shareholder return. Our year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports our growth objectives of growing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders.\nNow for highlights from our financial performance. Sales improved 8% for the third quarter and 16% year-to-date compared to the prior period. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price in Chicken and Prepared Foods. Average sales price increased in these segments in response to persistent increase in the cost of goods. Prices were lower in Beef, in line with expectations, and Pork segment versus the same quarter last year.\nWe delivered solid operating income of nearly $1 billion because of our diversified portfolio. Year-to-date, we are up 15% over prior year. As expected, year-over-year third quarter earnings were lower as Beef margins declined relative to a year ago but still performed well in comparison to historical results. Overall, earnings per share came in at $1.94 for the third quarter and $7.10 year-to-date.\nWe remain confident our actions will improve our long-term volume performance. However, our total volume was down both for the quarter and year-to-date. We are focused on overcoming the supply chain challenges, running our plants full and reducing our costs.\nChicken volume is up year-to-date, driven by demand and operational improvements, but down for the quarter. Lower quarterly volumes were driven by the fiscal year '21 fire at our rendering plant in Hanceville, Alabama as well as lower outside purchases of meat, chicks and eggs. This was partially offset by increased levels of internal harvest versus the same quarter last year, and we expect internal growth to continue as we ramp up our bird supply. For the full year, we expect Chicken to deliver 1% to 2% volume growth.\nIn Prepared Foods, volumes are down 5.5% year-to-date due to supply chain challenges, uneven foodservice recovery and the impact of increased pricing. Note also that the divestiture of our pet treats business last year drives 1.2% of the total decline. Although retail volume is down, we maintained our market leadership positions. While the foodservice channel continues to recover, volume growth remains strong in the broadline distribution led by breakfast sausage and bacon.\nIn Beef, volumes are down year-to-date but were up 1.3% versus the same quarter last year, and we continued to increase quarter-over-quarter due to higher head throughput and carcass weights.\nIn Pork, volumes were down year-to-date by 2.1% because of limited hog supply and lower export demand. We expect tightness in live hog inventories and declining export demand to continue to impact volumes in the fourth quarter.\nIn the International/Other segment, volumes are up 11.7% year-to-date and 21.9% versus the same quarter last year. Investments in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth. Volume growth was driven by our strengthening QSR and retail performance. Overall, our International business is growing both organically and inorganically.\nDuring Q4, we signed a joint venture agreement with Tanmiah Food Company in Saudi Arabia. This partnership will enable us to better serve our large global customers as well as expand our reach to new customers in the Middle East.\nWe're investing in new plants and expanding existing capacity across our global network. 8 plants are being constructed, with 2 expected to begin operation this fiscal year and 6 more by the end of fiscal year '23. This additional capacity will enable our team to address capacity constraints, accelerate our value-added growth and better serve growing consumer demand for protein.\nWe continue to make significant investments to attract and retain team members, including childcare, citizenship support, transportation, free technical and college education, on-site health clinics, maternity and paternity leave and other health benefits. Our near-site health centers in rural communities are seeing increased usage. These clinics provide team members, spouses and dependents comprehensive health care services at little to no cost.\nInvestment in team members are making an impact as higher pay and enhanced benefit offerings have led to lower turnover and absenteeism in our plants, which positions Tyson for future growth. We are committed to creating a differentiated work experience for our team members.\nThese investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from an ESG standpoint. Over the past several years, we have made many investments to these ends. Today, we are focused on 3 core pillars of our ESG framework, the formula to feed the future. Those 3 pillars are: reimagine people and community impact, drive product responsibility from farm to table and working toward achieving net zero.\nEarlier this quarter, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition and commitments to become the world's most sustainable and transparent protein company. In addition to the investments in people I mentioned a few moments ago, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, minimizing waste, water stewardship and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce emissions. We're setting aggressive ESG goals and working to meet them.\nAs we run our business better, we are making process improvements, digitalizing the supply chain, increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations. Our productivity program continues to deliver at the upper range of our initial projections, and we'll realize more than $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. We're continuing to accelerate digitalization across Tyson through supply chain planning and executional processes to better serve our customer. Automation remains a top priority for our business, and I'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation technologies. And given the macroeconomic environment, we are taking action to cut costs, reduce spend and reassess every role across the business to ensure that the work we do is value added for our customers and consumers.\nFinally, as we look for new and innovative ideas that can have the greatest impact on Tyson's productivity and sustainability objectives, we held the first-ever Tyson Demo Day. More than 100 companies were considered as presenters for the Demo Day, 20 were selected to make their pitch and ultimately, 6 companies were chosen for partnership. We are committed to strengthening our position as a global protein leader and driving value creation for our shareholders.\nAt our Investor Day, we outlined 5 imperatives for strengthening our position as a global protein leader. I've spoken about transforming our team member experience, increasing capacity, investing in digital and automation and the strength of our balance sheet. Chicken remains a key focus for our long-term success, and we are executing against our road map to restore top quartile performance for this segment. This quarter, we surpassed a 6% adjusted operating margin.\nWe expect to reach 40 million head per week by the end of this fiscal year and to continue to grow after that, enabling us to maximize our fixed cost leverage and grow our value-added business. We are optimizing our plant network by adding fully cooked capacity, converting plants for value-added production, implementing plant flexibility and optimizing our portfolio mix. We have come a long way and have more work to do, but I'm pleased with the progress that we are making in Chicken.\nAs we look to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business. We will have invested nearly $1.9 billion in fiscal year '22 focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives. Year-to-date, we returned to shareholders approximately $1.2 billion in dividends and share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return.\nI will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the third quarter.\n\nStewart F. Glendinning\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're pleased to report solid results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Sales were up for both the third quarter and year-to-date, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in cost of goods. Volumes were down both for the third quarter and year-to-date due to supply constraints and a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting consumer demand.\nLooking at our sales results by channel. Retail drove $173 million of top line improvement in the third quarter relative to the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $165 million. Sales to international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products, were $339 million greater than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. Donnie covered our earnings and EPS results.\nSlide 11 bridges operating income for the third quarter, which was $374 million lower than fiscal 2021. Volumes were down 1.9% in the quarter. Our pricing actions, which partially offset the higher input costs, led to higher sales during the quarter. We saw continued increases in cost of goods across the business, in some instances, up to 15%. Notable examples were labor, feed ingredients, live animals and freight costs.\nSG&A was $20 million unfavorable to the same period last year due to increased investment in advertising and promotional spend and technology-related costs partially offset by lower commission costs incurred by selling direct to customers rather than via brokers. As Donnie said, we are assessing all of our SG&A expenses across the business to identify nonvalue-added spend. Savings from our productivity program initiatives continue to have a positive impact on margins.\nMoving to the Beef segment. Sales were approximately $5 billion for the third quarter, flat versus the same period last year but up 15% year-to-date at nearly $15 billion. Sales in the quarter remained strong supported by higher volume but offset by lower average sales price driven by softer consumer demand for premium cuts of beef. Global consumer demand for beef products remain strong, and we expect volume to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as improved labor participation supports higher plant productivity.\nOn expenses, we incurred greater costs during the third quarter versus the comparable prior year period as live cattle costs increased approximately $480 million in the quarter. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by higher herd liquidation due to drought conditions.\nWe delivered segment operating income of $506 million in the quarter, down 55% versus the prior year comparable period. Our operating margin of 10.2% was lower than the same quarter last year but remains a strong performance. We expect to see Beef margins return closer to an expected long-term 5% to 7% average.\nLooking next to the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 6% versus the same period last year, but up 4% year-to-date at $4.8 billion. Global demand is being impacted domestically by high retail prices and internationally by the strong dollar, making U.S. pork relatively expensive as compared to alternative sources globally. For the quarter, the average sales price decreased 3.9%.\nSegment operating income was $25 million and $248 million for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. While down 63% versus the comparable prior year quarter, operating income is down less than 1% year-to-date. Overall operating margins for the segment declined to 1.5% for the quarter. The operating income deterioration was driven by compressed pork margins with rising hog costs and a constrained cutout.\nMoving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 5% relative to the same period last year and up 9% year-to-date at $7.2 billion. Sales increased despite a volume decline driven by higher average sales prices. Note, part of the volume decline in the quarter was driven by the sale of our pet treats business.\nOur brand strength and category relevance has enabled continued strong performance across multiple categories. Operating margin for the segment was 7.6% or $186 million for the quarter, up versus last year. Year-to-date, operating margin is 8.9% and flat compared to the prior year at $635 million.\nCost of goods continues to increase, pressuring our cost of production. To offset higher costs, we've executed productivity initiatives, revenue management and optimized our spend. To support our growth aspirations, we continue to invest in marketing and trade to increase the market share of our brands.\nMoving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.4 billion for the quarter, up 26%. Year-to-date, sales are up 25% at $12.3 billion. Average sales price increased in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures has reduced risk by allowing us to be more agile in response to increasing cost of goods.\nChicken delivered adjusted operating income of $269 million in the third quarter, representing an operating margin of 6.2%. Quarterly operating income increased over the same quarter last year due to higher average sales price and efficiency improvements partially offset by increased cost of goods. For the third quarter, we experienced $145 million in higher feed ingredient costs versus prior year, and we recognized $23 million in net derivative losses compared to $56 million of net derivative gains in the prior year.\nTurning to Slide 16. Our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support our disciplined capital allocation approach. We remain focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members and business and returning cash to shareholders. We produced $1.9 billion of operating cash flow so far during fiscal year '22, and that's after funding a $1.9 billion increase in our working capital.\nOur leverage ratio at 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA demonstrates our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity, market capabilities and profitability. This will support return on capital generation above the market for our shareholders.\nFinally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have returned $491 million in dividends and repurchased $693 million of shares, including $170 million of shares during the third quarter.\nLet's now discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on the strong results year-to-date, we're maintaining our total company sales guidance at a range of $52 billion to $54 billion. We now expect total volume growth to be flat on a year-over-year basis.\nLooking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is on track, and we expect full year margins to be between 5% and 7% but at the lower end. Based on the current trends in retail and foodservice, we expect the full year margin in Prepared Foods to be at the lower end of the 8% to 10% range.\nIn Beef, we expect margins to move toward our expected 5% to 7% range as the live cattle-to-cutout price spread continues to decline. However, we still expect to deliver a full year AOI margin of 11% to 13%.\nIn Pork, due to margin compression from hog costs and global demand headwinds, we're reducing our full year AOI margin outlook to be in the range of 3% to 5%. In International/Other, we anticipate slightly lower results from our foreign operations in fiscal '22 due to supply chain disruptions and other impacts related to COVID-19.\nOur expectations for CapEx and net interest expense are lowered to $1.9 billion and $350 million, respectively. Our tax rate expectation is lowered from approximately 23% to approximately 22.5%. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders for the remainder of the year.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brandon for Q&A instructions. Brandon?\n\nBrandon Tucker\n\nThanks, Stewart. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Britt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nHello, and welcome to the Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call for Tyson Foods.

For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.\nI'll now turn the call over to Donnie.\n\nDonnie D. King\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Megan, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we reported strong second quarter and first half fiscal year '22 results. Our results would not have been possible without the work of our team members. I'm grateful for their dedication and diligent efforts this quarter as we continue to manage a complex and dynamic operating environment. We delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth driven by strong market fundamentals, acceleration of our productivity actions and improving operational execution across our segments.\nOur diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands and value-added products all contributed to our results. Strong performance in our Beef segment, continued recovery in Prepared Foods and an improvement in Chicken supported improved sales and earnings.\nOur retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, have driven strong share performance in the retail channel since the onset of the pandemic. This quarter, we delivered share gains in bacon, hotdogs and snacking.\nWe also continue to see recovery in the foodservice channel with our relative strength in QSRs and K-12, supporting continued share gains in branded value-added chicken. Overall, consumer demand for protein has remained strong, and we are taking deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes to better meet customer needs, including investing in new capacity, brands, product innovation and our team member experience.\nWe are seeing our investments in team members making an impact. Despite continued labor challenge during the Omicron surge this quarter, we're seeing lower turnover and absenteeism. We have invested in higher wages, benefits and other workplace enhancements, such as flexible schedules, child care and transportation.\nThe construction of new plants continue to progress. This additional capacity will enable our team to address capacity constraints and better serve growing demand for protein across all segments. Along with ramping up utilization of our newest plants in Humboldt, Eagle Mountain and Thailand, we have 4 plants expected to commence operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. In addition to the new sites, we're continually upgrading capacity as needed with approximately 10 projects planned in the third quarter, representing 25 million pounds of volume in Prepared Foods alone.\nIn addition, we are working closely with our customers to ensure that the fair value of our products incorporates the inflationary cost pressures impacting our business. For the first half, our cost of goods sold rose 15% relative to the same period last year. Every part of our business has been impacted by inflation. We experienced higher costs across our supply chain for all inputs from feed ingredients, live animals and other raw materials to cooking oils and basic supplies. We're also managing higher cost of labor and transportation due to robust demand, higher fuel costs and limited availability. As part of our effort to combat inflation and increase profitability, I'm pleased by our accomplishments to drive costs lower by accelerating our productivity actions.\nAlso, our balance sheet and liquidity position remain healthy, providing optionality to invest in growth across our portfolio and return cash to shareholders. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on total shareholder return. Our first half results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives and that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins and driving stronger returns for our shareholders.\nNow turning to the financial results. Let me give you some highlights. Sales improved 16% in the second quarter and 20% during the first half. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price and mix improvement. Average sales price trends reflect disciplined revenue management strategies in the context of a volatile, high-inflation environment. Like many other companies, we've seen varying levels of heightened inflation, notably in grains, labor, live animals, raw material and transportation costs. As I mentioned earlier, our teams have worked together with our customers to manage inflationary pressures.\nWe delivered solid operating income performance, up 57% during the second quarter and 47% for the first half. The performance in the first half was due to strength in Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods. Overall, our operating income performance translated to $2.29 in earnings per share for the second quarter, up 71% and $5.16 in earnings per share for the first half of 57%.\nLooking at our results on volume, we remain confident that our actions will improve our performance. But we are not where we expected to be by now as we faced the Omicron surge in the quarter and other labor and supply chain challenges. Due to these factors, our total volume was down slightly for the first half versus last year.\nChicken remained a bright spot, where volume was up 2.1% through the first half compared to the same period last year. This improvement was driven by solid fundamental demand as well as operational improvements. There is much more work to be done as we focus on filling our existing capacity. We are pulling multiple levers to drive sequential improvement in our performance. And as a result, I'm confident that we will see continued volume performance in the second half.\nIn Prepared Foods, volumes were down 4% in the first half compared to the same period last year. Approximately 1/3 of this decline was related to the pet treats divestiture with the remainder as a result of a challenging supply environment and uneven recovery of the foodservice channel. We are working to improve these results over the remainder of FY '22 as we continue to take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization.\nIn Beef, volumes were down 2.9% in the first half compared to the same period last year. However, Beef volumes increased quarter-over-quarter due to higher harvest weights. We expect continued volume improvements for the remainder of our fiscal year '22 as new team member recruitment strategies support an improved labor position and higher throughput.\nIn Pork, impacts associated with a challenging labor environment contributed to a 2.3% decline in volume in the first half compared to the same period last year. We expect tightness in live hog inventories to affect our second half volume.\nIn International/Other, our investments in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth objectives and volume improvement. Overall, we will continue to take actions across our business to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix and align our portfolio with customer and consumer needs. Although we have reduced our expectations for the full year, we still expect to grow our total company volumes in fiscal year '22.\nWe continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought-after place to work, and we're making significant investments to attract and retain team members. Our U.S.-based workforce is comprised of team members from more than 160 countries. In April, we announced that we are investing over $1 million in several nonprofit groups to expand legal and citizenship support for the team members aspiring to become U.S. citizens. This will allow us to scale a program from 7 Tyson facilities to serve 40 company locations in 14 states.\nWe recently announced an expansion of the Upward Academy program as our latest investment in our team members. Starting this summer, U.S. team members will have access to free education, including masters, undergraduate and associate degrees, career certificates as well as class in literacy and technology fundamentals. And Tyson will pay 100% of the cost of tuition, books and fees with an estimated investment of $60 million over the next 4 years.\nEnsuring the health and safety of our global team is a top priority. We continue to challenge ourselves to be an organization that stays ahead of the unforeseen event and adjusting our protocols to keep our team members healthy and safe. We have educated and encouraged team members to get vaccine boosters and have offered over 100 clinics across our office and plant locations.\nWe are also investing to support team member well-being more proactively in our rural communities. We now have 7 on or near-site Tyson health centers opened and operating. These clinics provide comprehensive health care services, including preventive screenings, chronic condition coaching, mental health counseling, lab services and sick visits at little to no cost to most of our team members or their spouses and dependents. Overall, we're confident that our actions will increase Tyson staffing levels and position us for future growth, and we will continue to explore innovative benefit offerings that make our team members' lives better.\nWe're making excellent progress on our productivity program, which will deliver more than $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal year '24. Based on current progress, we now expect to deliver more than $400 million of savings in fiscal year '22, which is on the high end of our previously disclosed range for the year.\nLast quarter, I highlighted our work in Prepared Foods to build a digital manufacturing platform that utilizes data to simplify complexity and optimize processing. I also shared our work to enhance the mix and allocation of our trucking fleet resources to enable better on-time deliveries to customers.\nThis quarter, deployment of our Tyson production system approach has improved our yield across all segments versus a year ago. Additionally, our procurement program is addressing total company spend, including direct material as well as plant and corporate indirect areas. This program continues to deliver savings in line with expectations.\nOur digital solutions journey has also progressed. In our supply chain, we are leveraging new processes and digital tools to quickly identify gaps in fulfillment. Meeting the demands of our customers on time and in full is of the utmost priority, and we are continuing to maximize our service levels.\nThe early results of our finance automation and digitization work also remain promising. For example, this program is providing more accurate billing and improved collections for Tyson while lowering our intensive labor. We are also investing aggressively in automation and technology to help address some of our most difficult roles in repetitive tasks. This is a well-planned program of automation to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance and asset utilization.\nThe debone automation program is continuing to scale in plants, and our Tyson proprietary debone automation solution is also beginning to roll out in select facilities. Looking ahead, we're starting to scale new programs like pack-out robotics to continue automating highly manual processes and deliver savings.\nChicken remains a top priority, and we continue to execute against our road map to restore top-quartile profitability for this segment. We've been committed to returning our operating margins to 5% to 7% level by the middle of FY '22.\nThis quarter, we delivered a 5% adjusted operating margin, in line with our previously communicated plan. Critical to improving our profitability is maximizing our fixed cost leverage of being staffed to standard and having enough birds to run our plants full. Since September, we have seen an improvement in our hatch rate that is consistent with the expectations that we shared at our December Investor Day.\nWe are committed to growing our harvest capacity utilization, and we outpaced the industry in the second quarter. Achieving improved chicken harvest and higher capacity utilization will allow us to build on the volume growth delivered by Chicken in the first half.\nIn parallel to actions to improve volume, we have also worked with customers to manage inflationary pressures by adjusting pricing to achieve a fair value for our products. This will be important to ensuring we deliver sequential improvement in our operating margins in the second half of fiscal year '22, especially with continued increases in key input costs, such as labor and feed ingredients.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, we are also making good progress on our automation objectives for the segment. This includes the rollout of debone automation and a range of other equipment, which will enhance our productivity and cost effectiveness. We have come a long way in a short period of time, and I'm pleased with the progress we are making in Chicken.\nTo recap, we have strong consumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. The 5 imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation for our shareholders. This starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as investing in improving our team member experience.\nSecond, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales. As a result, we expect our volume to outpace overall market growth over the next several years.\nThird, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment and continue to achieve key milestones on our road map to top-quartile profitability. Fourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our productivity program, where we are accelerating our efforts and now expect to deliver more than $400 million in savings this year.\nFifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business. We're on track to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives.\nWe also continue to return cash to shareholders. Through the first half, we returned approximately $850 million in dividends and share repurchases.\nAs a final comment before turning the call over to Stewart, I want to highlight that Tyson Foods understands we have a critical role to play in the global food system to make it more resilient, more sustainable and more equitable for current and future generations. Just recently, we completed a materiality analysis that will inform our long-range strategy. These insights from key stakeholders shape our strategic framework and provide direction on the expectations of our company.\nI will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through more detail on the financial results for the second quarter.\n\nStewart F. Glendinning\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're pleased to report strong results in the second quarter and first half of this fiscal year. Sales were up in the second quarter and the first half, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset inflation as well as improved product and channel mix. Volumes were down slightly through the first half impacted by continued labor challenges and a temporary disruption from the Omicron variant surge.\nLooking at our sales results by channel. Retail drove $424 million of top line improvement in the second quarter relative to the same quarter last year. Through the first half, retail sales have improved $773 million. In the second quarter, improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $684 million, and domestic export sales to international markets were $311 million stronger than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business.\nSecond quarter adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was up 57% relative to the same quarter last year, led by increases in Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods. First half adjusted operating income of $2.6 billion was up 47%, supported by increases in Beef and Chicken. Driven by the strong increase in operating income, second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.29 grew 71% compared to the same period last year. Second quarter earnings per share also benefited from lower net interest expense and higher other income.\nSlide 11 bridges year-to-date operating income for the second quarter, which was $422 million higher than fiscal 2021. Volumes were down 1.5% in the second quarter. Volume improvement in Chicken, International/Other and Beef were offset by declines in Pork and Prepared Foods, where continued labor and supply chain challenges impacted throughput.\nOur price and mix and portfolio efforts led to higher sales during the quarter, which offset the higher input costs. We saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 25% or more. Notable examples were labor, feed ingredients, live cattle, lean hogs and freight costs.\nSG&A was $46 million unfavorable to the same period last year due to increased team member-related costs and investments in advertising and promotional spend in support of our brands. As a final note, both cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses in the quarter were partially offset by productivity savings.\nMoving to the Beef segment on Slide 12. Segment sales were approximately $5 billion for the second quarter, up 24% versus the same period last year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by continued robust demand for Beef products, which supported higher average sales price and volume. The cut-out and our average sales price remained relatively strong during the quarter despite some consumer demand shifting toward lower-cost beef cuts.\nQuarterly volume improved compared to the prior year despite the Omicron surge experienced by the business. We expect volume to continue to improve in the second half of this fiscal year as new team member recruitment strategies support improved staffing and higher throughput levels. On expenses, we incurred greater costs during the second quarter versus the comparable period a year ago as live capital costs increased approximately $545 million in the quarter. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by higher herd liquidation due to drought conditions. As of February, 54% of cattle inventory were in areas experiencing drought conditions, which may lead to additional herd liquidation through the remainder of the fiscal year.\nWe delivered segment operating income of $638 million in the quarter, up 43% versus the comparable period. This improvement was driven by solid global demand for beef products, supporting a higher cut-out as well as higher specialty product values, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Our operating margin of 12.7% was higher than the same quarter last year but was down on a sequential basis versus the last 2 quarters as cost increases led to a narrowing of the spread.\nLooking next at the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 6% versus the same period last year. Average sales price increased 10.8%, but volumes were 4.8% lower relative to the same period last year. Average sales price was up due to higher input costs, while volumes were lower due to labor challenges from the Omicron surge, which led to lower processing throughput.\nSegment operating income was $59 million for the quarter, down 12% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined to 3.8%. The operating income deterioration was driven by softer exports, higher input costs and labor challenges.\nMoving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 11% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down in the quarter given labor and supply chain challenges and uneven foodservice recovery and the sale of our pet treats business. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by higher average sales price. Consumer demand has remained durable even as we've worked to manage inflation through price increase. Overall, consumer response to higher price levels is below historical expectations as our brand strength and category relevance has enabled continuing strong demand. Raw material costs and logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor all increased our cost of production.\nTo offset higher costs, we have executed productivity, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives, while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through increased marketing and trade support. Operating margins for the segment were 11% or $263 million for the quarter, up 21% versus the same quarter last year.\nMoving on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.1 billion for the quarter, up 15%. Volumes improved in the quarter due to strong consumer demand and operational improvements. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes. We expect to deliver further volume improvements in the second half of fiscal 2022 as harvest numbers improve and we continue to optimize the operational efficiency of our plants. Average sales price improved 14.4% in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to price recovery offsetting inflationary costs.\nOn pricing, we made meaningful progress to shift our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing those benefits. We restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal 2021 to be more agile in response to market and inflationary conditions.\nChicken delivered adjusted operating income of $203 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22, representing an operating margin of 5%. Operating income increased in the second quarter due to increased sales volume and higher average sales prices, partially offset by the impacts of inflationary market conditions, including increased supply chain costs and a challenging labor environment.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal '22, we experienced $100 million of higher feed ingredient costs and $101 million of net derivative gain as compared to $10 million of net derivative gains in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. During the fiscal month of April, the beginning of our third quarter, we have achieved an approximate 5% operating margin, excluding mark-to-market derivative impacts. Restoring competitiveness in our Chicken business remains a top priority, and we are making progress on achieving our long-term targets for adjusted operating margin, but we still have work to do.\nTurning to Slide 16. Our healthy cash flows have continued to support a broad capital allocation approach. We are focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. Consistent with our expectations, our operating cash flows were down slightly in the first half of the year due to planned investment in working capital.\nAnd considering of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we used our existing liquidity to retire $1 billion of debt in the second quarter. Since the start of the pandemic, which this quarter now marks 2 years ago, we have reduced gross debt by approximately $3.8 billion. We maintained our leverage ratio at 1.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality.\nInvesting in our business for both organic and inorganic growth will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. This will support strong return on capital generation for our shareholders.\nFinally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We bought back $175 million of shares at an average price of $88.50 per share during the second quarter. This is in addition to the $348 million of shares repurchased during the first quarter.\nLet's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. Based on the strong first half results, we're raising our total company sales guidance to a range of $52 billion to $54 billion. In support of our sales growth, we now expect 1% to 2% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full.\nLooking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we expect full year margins to be between 5% and 7%. Based on our first half performance, we now expect the full year margin in Prepared Foods to be in the range of 8% to 10%.\nIn Beef, we are raising our AOI margin to 11% to 13%. We still expect the first half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize in the second half. We expect the cattle price increases will reduce the overall margin in the back half.\nIn Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal 2021, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. As is normal seasonality for Pork, we expect the first quarter to be the strongest.\nIn International/Other, we anticipate reduced results from our foreign operations in fiscal '22 due to supply chain disruptions and other impacts related to COVID-19. Our expectations for CapEx, net interest expense and tax rate remain unchanged. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders over the course of the year.\nI will now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan?\n\nMegan Britt\n\nThanks, Stewart. We'll now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions."

Prepared remarks today will be provided by Donnie King, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stewart Glendinning, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, David Bray, Group President, Poultry; Noelle O'Mara, Group President, Prepared Foods; Shane Miller, Group President, Fresh Meat; and Chris Langholz, Group President, International, will join the live Q&A session.\nWe have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks, and these are available on the Investor Relations section of the Tyson website and through the link to our webcast.

King\n\nPresident & CEO, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Megan, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call today. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2022 results. Tyson Foods once again delivered strong financial results. I would like to start by thanking our team members for their dedication Herculean efforts this quarter as we managed a complex and dynamic operating environment.\nAt our Investor Day, I shared our plan to grow our top and bottom lines aggressively over the next 3 years. This meant EPS growth of high single digits relative to a 2019 baseline and volume growth ahead of the market. Our results this quarter put us firmly on that path. We achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth, both of which were driven by ongoing demand strength, productivity savings and improving execution across our segments. Our diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands and value-added products contributed to our results.\nStrong performance in our Beef segment, earlier-than-expected recovery in Prepared Foods and improvement in Chicken and Pork all supported strong earning results. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park maintain their volume share position even as we work through price increases to address inflationary pressure. And our foodservice Focus 6 product lines grew share year-over-year in broadline distribution. This growth was driven in large part by value-added chicken, which outperformed industry recovery and breakfast sausage where we were seeing improved fill rates. Importantly, and despite the continued impact of COVID-19, our volumes improved slightly across the company relative to the same quarter last year.\nChicken was a bright spot, where we saw our volumes improved 3.6%. While this is a good start, we are not where we want to be on volume. So we're taking actions segment by segment to improve our volume performance. These actions include investing in our team members, in additional capacity and in brands and product innovation.\nAs discussed at Investor Day, we are also in the process of building 12 new plants. Each of these is progressing and each will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and meet the growing global demand for protein. Bottom line, we're committed to improving our total company volumes during the year.\nWe're also making sure that our pricing incorporates inflationary cost pressures on our business. In the quarter, our cost of goods sold was up 18% relative to the same period last year. We are seeing higher costs across our supply chain, including higher input costs, such as feed and ingredients. We're also managing higher cost of labor, transportation due to strong demand and limited availability. With these higher costs, we work closely with our customers to achieve a fair value for our products.\nAs a result, our average sales price for the quarter increased 19.6% relative to the same period last year. This helped us capture some of the unrecovered costs due to the timing lag between inflation and price.\nFinally, our balance sheet and overall liquidity position are strong, providing optionality to pursue strategic growth priorities and invest in growth across our portfolio. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital to support capacity expansion while achieving improved returns on invested capital.\nOur first quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives, that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders. While we're growing our business, we are mindful of our corporate responsibilities around environment, social and governance goals.\nFor example, we committed to investing in and supporting our communities in rural America and around the world. Last year, Tyson Foods donated more than 16 million pounds of protein, the equivalent of 64 million meals to fight hunger. We're incredibly proud of this work and the people that make it possible.\nTyson is a great company with a great team doing great things, and I'm pleased that this was recognized just last week by Fortune Magazine, who announced that for the sixth year in a row, Tyson Foods was #1 in our sector in their rankings of the world's most admired companies.\nNow let's look at a few financial highlights from the first quarter. Our results included double-digit top and bottom line growth. We delivered solid operating income performance, up 40% for the quarter. This performance was broad-based across segments where continued strong consumer demand and effective pricing to mitigate the impact of inflation drove higher earnings.\nOn volume, we are up slightly. And while we're working to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and the ability to achieve optimal mix across our network. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, our volume performance is outpacing our peer set. In retail, despite substantial market pressures, core business lines held share in the first quarter, led by strong performance in lunch meat, hotdogs, snacking and bacon. We also realized strong e-commerce results with Tyson Foods outpacing total food and beverage growth in our core lines gaining share in the quarter.\nStill, customer demand continues to outpace our ability to supply products. So we have targeted actions in each segment to improve volumes. This is key to delivering on our commitments. To realize our volume goals, we must be able to fully staff our plants across the company. We continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought after place to work.\nFor example, we provided our hourly team members with more than $50 million in bonuses during the first quarter. We are piloting subsidized and on-site childcare and we are adjusting schedules to flex with workforce needs. These actions are bearing fruit as we see some improvement on the labor front. And while we have seen some labor challenges during the Omicron surge, we are generally seeing lower turnover in absenteeism.\nWe saw Chicken volumes grow 3.6% in the quarter, driven by strong fundamental demand and improved live production. What is important to note is that we grew ahead of the market and gained market share.\nIn Prepared Foods, volumes were down 2.6% in the first quarter. About half of the decline was related to Pet Treat's divestiture. We expect to sequentially improve these results over the remainder of fiscal year '22 as we take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization. In Beef, volumes were down 6.2%, driven by labor shortages previously mentioned. In addition, port congestion has also dipped in export volumes in the segment. We expect these headwinds on volume to normalize over the course of fiscal 2022.\nIn Pork, we have sequentially improved our capacity utilization. We are still working to optimize the mix. In International/Other, while we are starting from a relatively small base, our investment in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth objective. Overall, we expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% in FY '22, outpacing protein consumption growth.\nChicken remains a top priority and we continue to execute against our road map to achieve an operating income margin of 5% to 7% on a run rate basis by mid fiscal '22. I remain confident we will meet this goal. In the first quarter, we've started to see profitability improvement resulting from our actions. For example, we're investing aggressively in automation and technology to help us address some of the most hard to fill roles. This is not a series of projects, but is a well-planned program with automation designed to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance and asset utilization.\nThe second imperative is to improve operational performance and critical to improving performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough furs to run our plants full. Since September, we've seen an improvement in our hatch rate ahead of our expectations. We continue to expect full recovery in this year. We were pleased with our volume growth in the quarter and expect further improvements as we grow our harvest capacity utilization from an average of 37 million head per week in FY '21 to 40 million head per week by year-end. We've noted previously that strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products put our buy versus grow program at a relative disadvantage. We have reduced our reliance on outside meat accordingly.\nWe will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our volumes and be the best in the business. The plan we have continues to be the right plan and our commitment to winning with our team members, winning with our customers and consumers and winning with operational excellence is delivering results.\nLast year, we announced the launch of a new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster, more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program aims to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline and has 3 critical focus areas, which are operational and functional excellence, digital solutions and automation.\nWe're making some good progress on this front. I spoke just a minute ago about our investments in automation, but we've also attacked other issues. In Prepared Foods, we're making use of supply chain, digitization and advanced analytics. Our digital manufacturing platform allows us to analyze real-time data to take actions to optimize process conditions that drive better yields, lower costs, consistent quality and increased output.\nIn transportation and logistics, we have established ongoing optimization of the mix and allocation of our private fleet, dedicated fleet and third-party fleet, mitigating inflationary pressures and supporting better on-time deliveries to our customers. In addition, we continued the expansion of our direct shipment program, reducing miles driven and product touches in our supply chain. As a result of projects like these, we're on track to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings in fiscal 2022.\nWe shared at our Investor Day that we are taking actions to accelerate our growth and drive disciplined return on invested capital. The 5 imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation. This starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment.\nWe are proud of our COVID-19 vaccine policy implemented last year in the U.S. and of the broader investments that we have made to keep our team members, their families and our communities safe. Because of our policy, our team members are better protected and the cases we do see have been mild or asymptomatic, resulting in an extremely low number of hospitalizations. We are strongly encouraging boosters and are hosting clinics to make it easier for our team members and their families to get boosted.\nSecond, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales. As a result, we expect our volume to outpace this growing market. Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment. This starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022.\nFourth, we're driving operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We're working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization. Fifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we are using our financial strength to invest in our business. On capital alone, we're expected to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives.\nAnd we continue to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned over $500 million in dividends and share repurchases.\nTo wrap it up, we are committed to winning with our team members, customers and consumers as well as winning with operational excellence. I'm more excited about the future of Tyson Foods with each passing day. And I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.\n\nStewart F. Glendinning\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donnie.\nLet me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased to report a strong overall start to the year. Our sales were up approximately 24% in the first quarter, largely a function of our pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes were also up slightly, although impacted by continued labor challenges.\nLooking at our sales results by channel, retail drove almost $350 million of top line improvements versus last year. Improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1 billion and our export sales were nearly $333 million stronger than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. First quarter operating income of $1.4 billion was up 40% relative to the same quarter last year due to increased earnings in Beef, Pork and Chicken. Driven by the strength in operating income, first quarter earnings per share grew 48% to $2.87. Higher operating income led to higher adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year. And first quarter EPS also benefited from lower net interest expense and taxes.\nSlide 10 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was $407 million higher than fiscal 2021. Volumes were up slightly during the year, primarily a result of improvement in Chicken, Pork and International/Other, offset by declines in Beef and Prepared Foods. Declines in Beef and Prepared Foods were largely due to continued labor challenges in those segments.\nOur pricing actions led to approximately $2.1 billion in sales and price/mix benefit during the quarter. which offset the higher cost of goods sold of $1.6 billion. We saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 20% to 30%. Notable examples were labor, grain costs, live cattle and hog costs and freight costs. And finally, SG&A was $88 million unfavorable to the same period last year, which was largely a result of cycling a $55 million benefit recorded last year for the recovery of cattle.\nMoving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were more than $5 billion for the quarter, up 25% versus the same period last year. Sales growth was driven by continued strong demand for beef products, which has supported higher average sales price. Partially offsetting higher sales prices were higher capital costs during the first quarter versus the comparable prior year period. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal year 2022 and continue to expect it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs.\nWe delivered segment operating income of $956 million, up 81% versus the prior comparable period. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut out, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Our operating margin of 19.1% was notably higher than the same quarter last year but was down on a sequential basis versus the last 2 quarters as cost increases led to a narrowing of the spread.\nNow let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 12. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased 12.8% and volumes were slightly higher relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $164 million for the quarter, up 41% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment improved to 10.1% for the quarter. The operating income improvement was driven by higher spreads in the business.\nMoving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 10% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice more than offset by labor and supply chain challenges. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by inflation-justified pricing. During the quarter, retail core business mines maintained share, driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong execution by our team.\nOperating margins for the segment were 8% or $186 million for the first quarter. The decline in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material and other input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor have increased our cost of production. Our pricing lagged inflation, but we expect to recover cost increases during fiscal 2022. In addition to pricing, we've executed productivity, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support.\nMoving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.9 billion for the quarter, up 37%. Volumes improved 3.6% in the quarter due to strong consumer demand and increased life production. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal 2022 as hatch recovers, and we continue to look for ways to operate our plant more efficiently.\nAverage sales price improved around 20% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. On pricing, we made tremendous progress toward driving our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing those benefits. We restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal 2021 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions.\nChicken delivered adjusted operating income of $117 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing an operating margin of 3%. Operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $185 million of higher feed ingredient costs.\nNow turning to Slide 15. As part of our capital allocation approach, we focused on building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we used improved earnings to retire debt in fiscal year 2021 and expect to do the same this year.\nContinued strength in our earnings this quarter have further improved our leverage ratio to 1.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. This will support strong return generation for our shareholders.\nFinally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We finished the quarter with a powerful balance sheet and continued capital allocation optionality.\nLet's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $49 billion to $51 billion, although we expect to perform at the upper end of the range. In support of our sales growth, we still expect a 2% to 3% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full.\nLooking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments, in Chicken, our operational turnaround is working and we still expect to achieve a run rate profitability of 5% to 7% by the middle of the year. We expect full year margins that also fall between 5% to 7%. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. Based on our first quarter performance, we now expect the full year margin performance in Prepared Foods to be at the upper end of the range.\nIn Beef, we are maintaining our AOI margin at 9% to 11%, but we expect to perform at the upper end of the range. Also, we expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year. In Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. As is normal seasonality for pork, we expect the first quarter to be the strongest. In International/Other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability.\nConsistent with our expectation for a meaningful increase in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles, we anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal 2022. We now expect lower net interest expense due to lower anticipated average debt balances during the fiscal year. Our expectations for productivity savings and tax rate changes remain unchanged. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders over the course of the year.\nIn summary, we've had a strong start to the fiscal year. We have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. We set out ambitious calls at our Investor Day, and we expect to achieve them. I'll now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan?\n\nMegan Britt\n\nThanks, Stewart. We'll now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction."

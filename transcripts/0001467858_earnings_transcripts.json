[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, October 21, 2025.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2025. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.\nJoining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; along with Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Susan Sheffield, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOn today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language.\nAnd with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChief Executive Officer, General Motors Co.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I want to begin by recognizing the dedication and hard work of our entire GM team, including our employees, dealers and suppliers. Their agility in helping navigate a rapidly changing regulatory and policy environment while keeping our customers at the center has been outstanding. Thanks to their efforts and our leading portfolio of vehicles, we delivered another very strong quarter of earnings and free cash flow.\nIn the U.S., we achieved our highest third quarter market share since 2017 with strong margins, and our restructured China business was profitable once again. Based on our performance, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our full year guidance.\nI also want to thank the President and his team for the important tariff updates they made on Friday. The MSRP offset program will help make U.S.-produced vehicles more competitive over the next 5 years, and GM is well positioned as we invest to increase our already significant domestic sourcing and manufacturing footprint. We appreciate the administration's ongoing support for American Innovation and jobs, and we look forward to progress on trade deals with countries like Canada and Mexico.\nAs trade policies have evolved, we have acted with urgency and discipline to strengthen GM's position. Earlier this year, we announced $4 billion in capital investments to onshore production at plants in Tennessee, Kansas and Michigan over the next 2 years. Today I'm happy to share that we have decided to more than double the planned Chevrolet Equinox production at our Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas, above and beyond what we announced earlier this year. Once these investments come online, we plan to produce more than 2 million vehicles per year in the United States.\nWe are also investing close to $1 billion to build a new generation of advanced fuel-efficient V8 engines in New York. Importantly, we are maintaining our capital discipline while addressing this production and creating new jobs in the United States.\nWe are also monitoring the supply of certain chips from China. This is an industry issue I know you're all aware of. While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. The situation is very fluid, and we will provide updates throughout the quarter as appropriate.\nOn the regulatory side, our portfolio and capacity plans over the last several years had been heavily influenced by steadily increasing stringency requirements for fuel economy and emissions. To meet these requirements, we were working aggressively to install and scale EV capacity. Now with an evolving regulatory framework and the end of the federal consumer incentives, it's clear that near-term EV adoption will be much lower than planned. This is resulting in higher variable costs as we expect to utilize less capacity across our EV plants and supply chain.\nAll of this drove our decision to transition Orion assembly from EV to ICE production and to sell our joint venture-owned cell plant in Michigan to LG Energy Solution. It's also why we recorded a $1.6 billion special item charge in the third quarter. $1.2 billion of the charge is for noncash impairments, most of which are related to the Orion transition, reductions in battery module assembly capacity, our decision to stop development of next-generation hydrogen fuel cells and the write-off of CAFE credits and associated liabilities. The remaining $0.4 billion is for cash charges related to supplier contract cancellation costs.\nOur retail product portfolio is unchanged. We will continue to build award-winning products like the Chevrolet Equinox EV and the Cadillac Escalade IQ, which have been very successful with customers. We're proud of them and we believe their performance will improve even in a smaller market.\nHowever, we have decided to stop BrightDrop production at [ CAME ] assembly and assess the site for future opportunities. This is not a decision we made lightly because of the impact on our employees. However, the commercial electric van market has been developing much lower than expected, and changes to the regulatory framework and fleet incentives have made the business even more challenging. Our actions on BrightDrop and our ongoing work to reset our capacity will cause us to recognize a charge in the fourth quarter. By acting swiftly and decisively to address overcapacity, we expect to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond, making us much better positioned as demand stabilizes.\nEVs remain our North Star, so we will continue to invest in new battery chemistries like LMR, new form factors and other architectural improvements to drive improved profitability.\nI'm equally confident in our ICE strategy. It is clear that ICE volumes will remain higher for longer. We lead the industry today, and we are increasingly well positioned to meet strong sustained demand. For example, we are onshoring production of the Chevrolet Blazer, developing a next-generation Cadillac CT5 and redesigning and extending the Cadillac XT5. And when Orion assembly comes back online in early 2027, it will produce the Cadillac Escalade and then add our next generation of full-size light-duty pickup trucks.\nLooking ahead, our top priority as a leadership team remains returning North America to our historical 8% to 10% EBIT margins. To do this, we will continue to drive EV profitability improvements, maintain our overall production, pricing and incentive discipline, manage our fixed costs, and further reduce our tariff exposure net of our self-help initiatives. In addition, cross-functional teams are attacking our warranty expense by addressing the root cause inside GM at our suppliers and at our dealerships.\nWe are also executing plans to grow software and services like OnStar and Super Cruise to generate even greater revenue during and after each vehicle sale. So far this year, we have recognized nearly $2 billion in revenue from OnStar, Super Cruise and other software services, and our deferred revenue was up 14% from Q2 to almost $5 billion. That's off a base of 11 million OnStar subscribers, which is up 34% year-over-year. This includes more than 500,000 Super Cruise customers, which nearly doubled year-over-year. We expect robust double-digit revenue growth through the end of the decade with gross margins of about 70%.\nWe also continue to make great strides in our autonomous strategy and in the development of our next-generation software-defined vehicle platform. It will be transformational because we will be able to evolve the software layer of each vehicle independently from the hardware-defined physical layer. For customers, their vehicles will become smarter, more capable and more personalized over time. Our platforms will be more stable and last longer. We will see large reductions in complexity. And we will create new revenue streams from features and services.\nThis work is exciting and full of opportunity, and we're hosting a media event in New York tomorrow to hear from the leaders who are executing our technology strategy. We will share more on these and other initiatives with you as we go forward because great vehicles, innovative technology, a rewarding customer experience along with strong financial results will continue to set GM apart in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nThank you, and I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss the quarter in more detail.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I also want to start by recognizing the entire GM team for delivering another quarter of outstanding results, driven by our compelling portfolio of internal combustion and electric vehicles.\nWe continue to demonstrate disciplined incentives, pricing and inventory management while attaining a 17% U.S. share in the quarter, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Our U.S. incentives remain below the industry average for the 10th consecutive quarter. During the quarter, we reduced dealer inventories by 16% year-over-year, ending at 527,000 units. ICE inventory is turning quickly, and we actively managed EV inventory down by almost 30% since the end of the second quarter, bringing it to a more appropriate level as we move forward.\nAs we highlighted at a recent conference, this performance exemplifies how the team has structurally transformed GM over the past decade to focus on profitable growth and durable cash flows. We have successfully adapted to evolving macro conditions while restructuring underperforming business units. Combined with a leaner cost structure and the support of GM Financial, these actions have enabled us to significantly improve free cash flow efficiency while maintaining a strong, resilient balance sheet.\nLet's now turn to the third quarter financial results. Total company EBIT adjusted was $3.4 billion, down $700 million year-over-year. This included a gross tariff impact of $1.1 billion, which was a little less than we had expected due to lower import volumes from Korea. We were able to offset more than 30% of this amount through go-to-market, footprint and cost initiatives.\nThe administration's recently announced expansion of the MSRP tariff offset broadens the scope of parts eligibility for the program and will make U.S. vehicle production more competitive. Additionally, this supports tariff mitigation in 2026 and beyond while we work to adjust our supply chains. On heavy-duty tariffs, the impacts to GM will be minimal and are already factored into the tariff guidance we've provided.\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow was $4.2 billion, partially aided by $300 million in cash tariff offset reimbursements, which have now commenced and will continue into Q4. North America delivered Q3 EBIT-adjusted margins of 6.2%, enabled by record crossover deliveries and strong performance of our full-size pickups and SUVs. As in the second quarter, EBIT-adjusted margins in Q3 would have been around 9% excluding tariffs, well within our prior margin target of 8% to 10%.\nPricing was up modestly year-over-year with model year 2026 incremental pricing being partially offset by a small fleet headwind. EV sales reached record levels in Q3, supported by a pull forward in demand ahead of the consumer purchase incentive being eliminated. GM solidified its #2 position in the U.S. EV market with 67,000 deliveries and a 16.5% share.\nIn October, we are not surprised to see EV demand soften significantly, and we expect this trend to continue into early 2026 before we see what the natural demand is for EVs. Throughout this period, you can be assured that we will build the demand and continue to focus on improving EV profitability, including through material cost reductions by leveraging larger module sizes and new battery chemistries.\nWarranty expense was a $900 million headwind year-over-year in the third quarter. This is too high, and we need to do better. That being said, our customers always come first, and we are committed to looking after them as we take a comprehensive, multipronged approach to reduce warranty expenses. We are asking our dealers in the spirit of partnership to help us lower warranty repair costs. We are also pursuing deeper supplier quality validation and leveraging data, AI tools, OnStar connectivity and proactive over-the-air updates to identify and resolve issues faster.\nInternally, GM is managing repairs to minimize customer inconvenience, and we are refining repair processes, such as shifting from full transmission replacements in many cases to targeted component fixes, which have already yielded substantial cost reductions. In fact, because of these actions, we've seen overall warranty cash outlays stabilize over the past few months.\nTurning to GM International. GM China is continuing its successful turnaround and is comparing favorably to many of its global peers. In the third quarter, our market share grew 30 basis points year-over-year to 6.8%, and China equity income, which has now risen for 4 consecutive quarters, was $80 million. We continue to expect the full year to be profitable.\nGM International ex China EBIT adjusted was nearly $150 million and remain relatively stable year-over-year, supported by strong full-size pickup and full-size SUV sales in the Middle East.\nGM Financial posted another solid quarter with Q3 EBT adjusted of $800 million. They continue to deliver value for our customers and dealers while paying a $350 million dividend in the third quarter.\nRegarding capital allocation, we invested $2.1 billion in capital projects, paid down $1.3 billion of balance sheet debt and repurchased $1.5 billion of stock in the quarter. Despite a challenging external environment, we've repurchased $3.5 billion in stock year-to-date. As a result, our diluted share count at the end of Q3 stood at 954 million, a 15% reduction year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect our share count to continue trending lower as we continue to repurchase shares.\nRegarding our outlook, let me now walk through our updated guidance, along with key supporting assumptions. Based on strong product traction, ongoing disciplined execution and assuming minimal production disruption from the chip issue Mary mentioned earlier, we are raising our calendar year 2025 guidance to EBIT-adjusted of $12 billion to $13 billion; EPS diluted adjusted of $9.75 to $10.50 per share; and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion. This increase reflects our confidence in our underlying business performance and also incorporates the administration's recently approved expansion of the MSRP tariff offset.\nWe expect capital expenditures to be at the lower end of our $10 billion to $11 billion guidance range as we recalibrate our plan in light of policy and upcoming footprint changes.\nOur gross tariff exposure for 2025 has improved from the original $4 billion to $5 billion gross impact to a range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, driven by the expansion of the MSRP tariff offset. We expect to offset around 35% of this lower gross tariff impact through go-to-market cost and footprint initiatives.\nRelative to deliveries, we now expect a calendar year 2025 total vehicle SAAR of around 16.5 million units. From a wholesale perspective, seasonality will play a role in Q4 relative to Q3 with 7 fewer production days in the U.S., along with lower EV wholesales following the phaseout of the consumer credit.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect North American pricing to be up 0.5 point to 1%. In the fourth quarter, model year 2026 pricing will be partially offset by higher seasonal industry incentives. We will maintain disciplined production levels and are on track to achieve our year-end inventory target of 50 to 60 days.\nGM Financial is on track to deliver on its guidance of $2.5 billion to $3 billion of EBT adjusted for the full year, reflecting continued strong performance.\nNow looking ahead to 2026, we have multiple levers to carry our current momentum forward, including progress on EV losses, warranty costs, tariff offsets, regulatory requirements and fixed costs. As a result, we expect next year to be even better than 2025.\nIn closing, GM is stronger and more resilient than ever. We are adjusting our business to a new tariff and regulatory environment. In addition to the self-help initiatives I mentioned earlier, we are expanding our U.S. capacity and working together with our suppliers to increase U.S. content. We see a clear path back to our historical 8% to 10% EBIT margins in North America over time and remain committed to continuing to repurchase shares in accordance with our capital allocation policy.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.",

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, 22 July 2025. I would now like to turn the call over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for Q2 2025. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO, and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Susan Sheffield, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOn today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation, as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThank you, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another quarter of earnings that highlights the core strengths of General Motors. They include the appeal of our vehicles, customer loyalty to our brands, the growing value of technologies like OnStar and Super Cruise, as well as the creativity and resiliency of our global team. I am grateful for everyone's contributions: our employees, our dealers, and our suppliers. In the US and around the world, we have demonstrated consistent execution of our production and go-to-market strategies.\nWe do have opportunities from a quality perspective at both the supplier and the GM level, which Paul will talk more about in his remarks, but we are fundamentally very strong and resilient. As we discussed today, we have delivered strong underlying operating performance, and we are positioning the business for a profitable long-term future as we adapt to new trade and tax policies and a rapidly evolving tech landscape. Our clear priorities are to grow our already expansive US manufacturing footprint and domestic supply chain, further strengthen our international business, and continue to innovate in batteries, software, and autonomous technology.\nIn China, we have been working closely with our JV partner to improve sales, inventory management, costs, and profitability. The performance of our new energy vehicles has been especially strong, and in Q2, we reported our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. We were the only foreign OEM to gain share, and we reported positive equity income. In the US, the industry saw a spike in demand during the quarter due to tariff-related sales pull ahead, especially in April and May. Then, in June and July, demand returned to levels that are in line with our full-year outlook of 16 million units. Throughout the first and second quarters, GM outperformed the market in total, fleet, and retail market share year-over-year.\nWe also gained total, fleet, and retail market share sequentially from Q1 to Q2, despite increased incentives from our competitors. We delivered all of this with inventories at the end of June that were down year-over-year by almost 10%. Our incentives remained well below industry average for both ICE and EVs, and our pricing has been relatively consistent. I'm particularly pleased that the crossover portfolio we highlighted at our last investor day has been delivering record results. These 10 all-new or redesigned crossovers took huge leaps forward in design and technology, resulting in strong demand and revenue growth, while reducing complexity contributed to stronger profitability. The Chevrolet Equinox alone gained nearly six points of retail market share year-over-year in the industry's largest segment, thanks to the popularity of both the ICE and EV models.\nWe are growing in EVs because we have a strategic portfolio of vehicles that people love for their design, performance, range, and value. Five years ago, the EV market essentially had one player. Today, there are 30, and Chevrolet is now the number two EV brand thanks to the success of the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV. In Q2, Cadillac became the number five EV brand overall. Cadillac has also become the luxury EV leader, fueled by the launch of the Escalade IQ and conquest rates that are above 75% for the Lyriq and approaching 80% for the Optiq. At the same time, all-electric road trips are getting easier by the day thanks to our fast-charging collaborations, which have been focused on regional interstate corridors outside of the coast.\nFor example, GM Energy 350kW chargers are now available at nearly 200 pilot travel centers along I-75 between Michigan and Florida, on the routes between Minneapolis and Milwaukee, Detroit and Cleveland, San Antonio and Houston, and Dallas and Nashville. Stations are typically no more than 150mi apart, so it's easy to take long-distance trips knowing you'll have access to reliable fast chargers and convenient services when you need them. In addition, the first of IONNA's charging stations, which can deliver up to 400kW, are now in service in North Carolina, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kansas, Arizona, and Missouri. By the end of the year, our customers will have access to more than 65,000 public fast-charging bays across the country. That will grow to more than 80,000 by the end of next year and 100,000 by the end of 2027, a more than 50% improvement in just three years.\nThe growth of our ICE and EV business is also fueling the expansion of our highly acclaimed Super Cruise technology, which in turn is helping guide the development of our personal autonomous vehicles. We're making steady progress growing Super Cruise. The technology is now offered on 23 models, and we continue to add new capabilities. We're on track to have more than 600,000 customers by year-end, each of whom has paid upfront for three years of service, with 70% of new Cadillacs delivered equipped with Super Cruise. Additionally, we have changed the way we approach the market for our OnStar products, and we now price our vehicles to include a period of basic OnStar services.\nAs a result, our OnStar subscriber totals are increasing at record rates, and we now have even more ways to engage directly with our customers throughout the life of the vehicle to drive our industry-leading loyalty even higher. As of today, we have booked $4 billion of deferred revenue from Super Cruise, OnStar, and other software services that we will recognize over time. Our projected Super Cruise revenue will be more than $200 million in 2025 and is expected to more than double in 2026. As we continue to scale, we anticipate growing at a robust double-digit CAGR through the end of the decade.\nWe have also introduced a new and improved My GM Rewards customer loyalty program and credit card portfolio that gives our members access to more savings opportunities on GM products and services and exclusive access to member-only experiences like trackside access at racing events and off-the-grid EV excursions. We invested in these programs because our loyalty program members are very valuable. They buy vehicles with higher MSRPs and visit dealers for service at nearly twice the rate of non-members. To build on our leadership positions in ICE and increasingly in EV and develop new sources of competitive advantage in AV software and services, we continue to strengthen our team with experienced executives and tech innovators like Sterling Anderson. Sterling, who was the co-founder and Chief Product Officer for autonomous trucking company Aurora, is now GM's Chief Product Officer.\nWe are also embracing AI across the enterprise, which is why we recruited Google and Cisco veteran Barak Turovsky to lead our efforts under Apple veteran Dave Richardson, who leads software and services engineering. Barak is building a world-class team of applied AI experts and researchers as we redefine how intelligence powers vehicle performance, customer experience, and operational excellence at GM. I believe everything we're doing strategically and proactively, along with closer alignment of emissions rules with consumer demand, will further differentiate us from our competitors, increase our resiliency, and drive overall profitability. For example, the $4 billion of new investment in our US assembly plants will add 300,000 units of US capacity for high-margin, light-duty pickups, full-size SUVs, and crossovers to help us greatly reduce our tariff exposure, satisfy unmet customer demand, and capture upside opportunities as we launch new models.\nThe capacity begins coming online in just 18 months, after which we project building more than 2 million vehicles in the US each year as we scale. At Orion Assembly in Michigan, this includes production of the Cadillac Escalade, followed by the launch of our next-generation full-size light-duty pickups. Adding Chevrolet Equinox ICE production at Fairfax Assembly in Kansas and moving Blazer ICE production to Spring Hill in Tennessee will further reduce our tariff exposure and increase utilization of our existing US capacity. In addition, we will have even more flexibility to adjust our mix of ICE and EV production than we do today, which will help us operate both Spring Hill and Fairfax more efficiently in a slower-growth EV market. Despite slower EV industry growth, we believe the long-term future is profitable electric vehicle production, and this continues to be our North Star.\nAs we adjust to changing demand, we will prioritize our customers, brands, and a flexible manufacturing footprint, as well as leveraging battery investments and other profit improvement plans. The battery strategy we are executing is central to our efforts to make EVs profitable and an even better choice for our customers. Domestically developed and produced cells are also necessary for a resilient and secure American-oriented supply chain. Our joint venture cell plant in Indiana, for example, will produce prismatic cells to help lower pack and total vehicle cost. Foundation work is almost done, and more than 50% of the steel structure has been erected. We have also confirmed that Ultium Cells Spring Hill in Tennessee will begin producing LFP cells developed by our Korean partner LGES, in addition to high-nickel pouch cells starting in late 2027.\nThe new lithium-manganese-rich, or LMR, chemistry that we are developing with LGES will be another game-changer because of its unique balance of energy density, charging capability, and cost efficiency driven by its reduced nickel and cobalt content. In large truck packs, we believe the potential savings from LMR may be even greater than using LFP at today's metal prices. Our expertise in leading cell chemistries and formats is also creating new business opportunities. Today, GM's second-life EV batteries are being repurposed by Redwood Materials. In addition, we're finalizing an agreement with Redwood to supply battery modules to Redwood Energy, their new energy storage business, which has been formed to meet surging power demand for AI data centers and other applications.\nImportantly, all of the cells our JVs build have and will continue to qualify for the Advanced Technology Manufacturing Tax Credits, and we're grateful for the continued support of the administration and Congress as we invest in American battery innovation and job creation. As you can see, we are well-positioned to succeed in an ICE market that has now a longer runway. We will continue to drive improved profitability for ICE and focus on EV profitability improvement to generate ongoing strong free cash flow. In addition, we'll continue to drive American innovation in batteries, AV, and software to further differentiate GM. Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul, who will share more details about the quarter.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate you taking the time to join us. The team continues to execute well on our disciplined strategy, which leverages our leading product portfolio and emphasizes prudent inventory management to support stable pricing while delivering consistent performance. Our agility and responsiveness to evolving consumer preferences and regulatory demands remain key strengths that set us apart. For the first half, total company revenue was a record $91 billion, driven by strong demand, stable vehicle pricing, and continued growth at GM Financial.\nNorth America revenue was also a first-half record at nearly $77 billion, up slightly year-over-year. We maintained production levels in line with our full-year plan as early quarter sales acceleration normalized. This measured approach, combined with strong sales that outpaced the industry, reduced US dealer inventory to 526,000 units, down nearly 10% year-over-year and almost 12% compared to the end of 2024.\nEBIT adjusted was $3 billion for the quarter, inclusive of a net tariff impact of approximately $1.1 billion, with minimal mitigation offsets. As we've previously mentioned, mitigation efforts will take time to yield results, limiting their effect on Q2. However, we're still tracking to offset at least 30% of the $4 to 5 billion full-year 2025 tariff impact through strategic actions such as manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives, and consistent pricing. Looking at our sales performance, GM's US market share reached 17.3% in H1 of the year, marking a consistent upward trend and a 1.2 percentage point increase year-over-year, more than double the gain of our closest competitor. As Mary mentioned, continued growth across a number of SUV segments was a key driver, with the Chevrolet Equinox standing out as its total sales rose more than 20% compared to the same period last year.\nOur share gains came on the back of strong product, not aggressive pricing. Indeed, in the first half of the year, our US incentives as a percentage of average transaction price were more than two percentage points below the industry average, highlighting the strength of our product portfolio, our disciplined production strategy, and our sustained pricing power. Turning to capital allocation, we remain focused on striking the right balance between investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning capital to shareholders. During Q2, we announced nearly $900 million for the Tonawanda propulsion plant to support our next-generation V8 engine, along with a $4 billion investment in our US manufacturing footprint. These strategic investments will expand capacity, support next-generation full-size SUV and pickup production, and enhance flexibility to shift between ICE and EVs based on market demand.\nImportantly, not all of this nearly $5 billion investment is incremental to our prior capital plans. A portion is being offset through cost efficiencies, internal reallocations, and by aligning the timing of investments with product updates. Our annual capital spending outlook remains unchanged at $10 to 11 billion for 2025, with a modest increase to $10 to 12 billion projected for 2026 and 2027. This includes key investments in our battery joint ventures, such as Ultium Cells' production of LMR and LFP chemistries, as well as our partnership with Samsung SDI. With regard to our balance sheet, we issued $2 billion of debt during the quarter. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including a $1.8 billion term loan to Ultium Cells LLC to support the voluntary early repayment of their U.S. Department of Energy loan, as well as refinancing a portion of the $1.25 billion note maturing in October.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, which gives us ample flexibility to navigate the current environment while continuing to invest in key future projects and return capital to our shareholders. Speaking of shareholder returns, we completed the $2 billion ASR during the quarter, retiring an additional 10 million shares, which brought the total shares retired under this program to $43 million. On a diluted basis, this resulted in 971 million shares at the end of the second quarter, representing a 4% reduction since the end of 2024 and a 15% decrease compared to the end of Q2 last year. Supported by our strong cash flows, with increased visibility around tariffs and the broader business environment, we resumed open market repurchases in early July.\nLet me now walk through the second quarter financial results in more detail. Total company EPS diluted adjusted was $2.53, and EBIT adjusted was $3 billion, down $1.4 billion year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by a net tariff impact of $1.1 billion in the quarter. We benefited from lower fixed costs, improved mix, and foreign currency impacts, which largely offset the effect of lower volume, EV inventory adjustments, and higher warranty-related charges. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $2.8 billion, down $2.5 billion year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by tariff payments, as well as headwinds from working capital and lower dealer inventory levels. In North America, we delivered EBIT adjusted of $2.4 billion and EBIT adjusted margins of 6.1%. Excluding the impact of tariffs, our margin would have been approximately 9%, which underscores the fundamental strength of our business.\nOn a comparative basis, this keeps us well within our pre-tariff margin target of 8 to 10%. In addition to the impact of tariffs, warranty expenses have also been obscuring our strong performance, including a $300 million increase in the second quarter compared to last year. The main factors behind higher warranty expenses relate to L87 issues and higher warranty claims from software issues on some of our early EV launches. Let me be clear. We are not happy with our warranty trend and are facing these challenges head-on, with the top priority always being our customers. We've provided extended warranties in some instances and taken other proactive steps to support those affected, including shifting some supply of our components to our after-sales group to decrease repair times. To address the root causes, we are pursuing multiple paths.\nWe are working to improve supplier quality across the board and are engaging more on critical component operations than ever before to ensure they consistently meet our high standards. Spending on a per-vehicle basis for software-related issues is down roughly 25% year-over-year when comparing most recently built vehicles to last year's models. Our expanded use of over-the-air updates, lower number of incidents per vehicle, and increased robustness in our infotainment system updates are all contributing to this improvement. Additionally, we are leveraging our enhanced diagnostics and developing new prognostic tools to identify issues sooner, develop repair procedures faster, and minimize unnecessary repairs. Complexity reductions enabled by winning with simplicity initiatives are also supporting improved launch quality, as seen on our recent Tahoe and Yukon launches. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect overall warranty costs to stabilize.\nFor the full year, we now expect warranty to be a year-over-year headwind. We remain fully committed to continuously raising our quality standards and delivering stronger results for both our customers and our business. North America pricing was a $200 million headwind in Q2 compared to last year. We continue to benefit from robust retail pricing, particularly with our new vehicle launches. However, we experienced a year-over-year headwind in fleet pricing, primarily due to increased competition resulting in pricing moderation. We expect the headwind from fleet pricing to continue into the second half of the year. GM International delivered second quarter EBIT adjusted of $200 million, an increase of $150 million year-over-year, driven by improved profitability from our China equity income. We expect this strong performance to continue into the second half of the year.\nOur China team is executing well and launching competitive NEV products that are fueling our market share gains and delivering positive equity income. Outside of China, our operations in South America and the Middle East continue to deliver consistent results. GM Financial delivered EBIT adjusted of $700 million and is on track to deliver within the full-year EBIT adjusted range of $2.5 to 3 billion. The team continues to grow the portfolio while paying a $350 million dividend to GM during the quarter. Credit performance and used vehicle prices remain healthy, reflecting relatively stable underlying consumer demand and market conditions. Now, turning to the forward outlook, our guidance and most of our underlying assumptions remain unchanged at EBIT adjusted in the $10 to 12.5 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $8.25 to 10 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $7.5 to 10 billion range.\nTo help with your modeling, let me first provide some thoughts on the first half to second half comparison. EBIT adjusted for the first half of the year totaled $6.5 billion. At the midpoint of our full-year guidance, this suggests that second half results will be about $1.75 billion lower. There are three key factors causing this dynamic. The first is an additional quarter of net tariff impact in the second half, which accounts for around $1 billion of this gap. The second is that we expect North America wholesale volumes to be down a low single-digit %, reflecting typical seasonality from fewer production days and the July shutdown. The last is increased spending related to preparations for the launch of our next-generation full-size trucks, which are scheduled to begin rolling out as model year 2027 vehicles, including also ramping investments at Orion Assembly to increase capacity in the US.\nNow, let's move to a year-over-year perspective for the full year. We continue to plan for a full-year total US SAAR of around 16 million units. This implies a second-half SAAR in the low to mid-15 million range. Pricing remains stable in the second quarter, as well as so far in July. Our guidance assumes this continues throughout the second half of the year. Our full-year North American pricing assumption is unchanged at a year-over-year increase of 0.5% to 1%. Turning to tariffs, the environment remains dynamic. The second quarter net impact of $1.1 billion was slightly lower than we had expected due to the timing of certain indirect tariff costs. As a result, we will likely see third quarter net tariff costs higher than in the second quarter.\nFor the full year, while there have been some puts and takes since we gave our initial guidance, our gross tariff impact remains unchanged at $4 to 5 billion this year as we continue to produce and import vehicles from Canada, Mexico, and Korea to avoid interruptions for our customers and dealers. Over time, we remain confident that our total tariff expense will come down as bilateral trade deals emerge and our sourcing and production adjustments are implemented. As mentioned earlier, we are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly 1/3 coming from each of our key actions: manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives, and consistent pricing. Next, I'd like to address the recent EV legislation signed by the administration.\nWhile we are still seeking further clarification on certain aspects, we anticipate these changes to have a minimal impact on our 2025 results. Our recent investments in US manufacturing give us the capabilities to flexibly produce an ICE and EV mix based on changing customer demand. We also anticipate that a more rational EV market, along with the need to balance regulatory requirements against reduced EV incentives, positions us well for sustained profitability in the years ahead. I want to be clear that our EV journey is about giving consumers choice. Over the last few years, a steady number of consumers are choosing electric vehicles. We offer a compelling EV portfolio and see significant growth potential, particularly in coastal markets where we remain underpenetrated. Now that we have a robust portfolio of EVs on the road, our investment focus has turned to driving down costs and improving profitability.\nMary shared examples of how new battery chemistries and form factors are driving cost efficiencies. However, we are also working to improve efficiency by making our vehicles lighter and more aerodynamic, enabling us to achieve greater range with smaller batteries. We are also standardizing key components, such as electric motors, across models to drive scale and reduce complexity. While we anticipate headwinds to EV profitability from lower volume due to the recent removal of government incentives, we remain focused on controlling what we can. These efforts are essential to improving our EV profitability and are critical to supporting the company's long-term success. In closing, everything we've achieved in the first half of the year reflects the commitment and hard work of the entire GM team.\nBy staying focused on our key priorities and investing in our future, we are well-positioned to navigate a dynamic environment and deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Thank you, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to analysts, we are asking that you limit your questions to one and a brief follow-up, so that we may get to everyone on the call. To ask a question, press star then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star then two. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi Research. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nFinancial Analyst, Citi Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Paul, I wonder if you could walk through the accounting for the $600 million you called out on the Delta with the EVs.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nHey, good morning, Mike. So I think you're referring to the lower of cost or market adjustment?\n\nMichael Ward\n\nFinancial Analyst, Citi Research\n\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nYeah. So as a reminder, with the sale inventory that we have, we are required to mark any potential losses on that inventory and take it to the inventory that reflects finished goods, etc. And as we work towards EBIT profitability, over time, that'll start to come down. But as we are seeing adjustments in the market, as we are looking at expectations on pricing as well as production and demand, we made an adjustment to that reflecting what we think is future pressure on EV sales going forward related to that inventory. That number will, we expect, ultimately get better as inventory comes down and we see more stability in pricing. But think about it as more of timing from that standpoint, and we expect it'll get better over time.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nFinancial Analyst, Citi Research\n\nOkay. Just as it relates to tariffs, you're taking as the world sits today, and you're talking about the input, $4 to 5 billion, and with mitigation, what would be the best-case scenario? We get a settlement with US, Canada, Mexico, and Korea. What would the impact look like right now, like for this year, if the world changed tomorrow and it went back the other way? And then what do you have strategically that helps you from a performance standpoint as you go forward with the $4 billion investment?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nYeah. Michael, it really, I mean, obviously, our tariff impact would be lower if the tariffs with Mexico, Canada, and Korea were lower. So that would have an immediate impact. You have to look at how much lower it's going to be to know what the total impact there would be. But that would have an immediate impact because, as Paul said earlier today, we have continued to bring the vehicles in from Korea because their contribution margin is positive and they're very much in demand. I mean, customers love those vehicles.\nWe've made some short-term shifts of production into our US footprint. I think what's going to happen, though, as we've always said, we feel we'll be able to offset 30%. A lot of that will come in later this year, as well as we'll continue to make improvements across the board as we get into next year. 18 months from now, the capacity, the $4 billion that we talked about, that capacity will come online, and then that will have another step function improvement. In some cases, the capacity we're adding is also for unmet demand. So it's a win-win from that perspective.\nSo we're on, I think, a positive trajectory as we look into later this year, into next year, and clearly into 2027, we'll be substantially better. To your original question, when we see what the final agreements are between these key countries for us, then we'll be able to size that as well. So you're prepared for the worst-case scenario, so there's potential for some upside the way we look at it. I think that's a fair comment. I think that's a fair comment. I don't want to predict what worst-case is. But I think with what we know today, I think that's what we've used. So I think there's potential.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nFinancial Analyst, Citi Research\n\nYeah. I don't think anybody can predict what's going to happen. So thank you very much.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThank you.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to start first with the question on pricing. I appreciate the commentary that the reason the price and the North America EBIT bridge was negative on fleet, but we did see pretty solid third-party data. So retail was tracking up decently based on the third-party data. Retail is the vast majority of your sales. Maybe you could just double-click on the dynamics there. As far as the second half goes, how do we reconcile the assumption of pricing sort of held where it is versus the notion that as others run out of pre-tariff inventory and inventory is now more expensive, others may now need to raise prices?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nHey, good morning, Dan. Thanks for that. Not surprised by the question. I think a couple of things. Number one, as we talk about fleet, it's largely a comp issue too because remember what we're lapping is fleet deals that were done under significantly tighter inventory than even where we are today at our tight levels. So we think that's some normalization. I mean, we're still comfortable with our pricing assumption of up 0.5% to 1% for the year going forward. We had the strength in Q1. We have tougher comps really through the middle of the year. But as we launch our model year 2026 vehicles with our sort of regular pricing strategy that we've encountered, we still see that working quite well. So I think there's a little bit of noise in the quarter here that we will work through, but nothing has changed about the full year.\nThere's a lot of talk out there about what people are going to do, what they're not going to do. As we've said before, we're pursuing our own sort of commercial path, one that is really centered around the discipline and the demand for our products. And that's worked really well for us. So despite having lower incentives, significantly lower incentives than the industry average, we're still picking up share. So I think to the extent that we see pricing change, we're going to continue to look at it according to where we see the demand for our products, which remains strong, and I expect will into the future.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you. That's helpful. Second question is just about the EV strategy going forward. I appreciate the commentary that you want to give consumers choice. But now that the tax credit is on its way out and there's changes in the regulatory schemes, I know we've seen a broad lineup across price points, but the profitability has been challenged. And I think these changes indicate profitability is probably going to get a little trickier, especially given you're losing some of the scale benefits, which was supposed to drive profit. So how do we look at the depth or the breadth of your EV lineup going forward and the price points at which you're offering vehicles when it seems like it's just going to be much tougher to get profitability at the more lower price points? Is it that we just see higher price points and that's the strategy?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, I think we have a very strategic EV portfolio when you look at luxury trucks and then the affordable vehicles like the Blazer and the Equinox EVs. And so we think we're covering the market very well. Before we even had IRA, the $7,500 tax credit, and some of the other portions of that, there still was demand for EVs. And we think as charging grows, and that's one of the things we highlighted because we are continuing very capital-efficiently through partnerships to make sure we continue to expand the EV charging network. I also think there's an opportunity for EVs for those that have a two-car family that have a garage that they can charge. It makes a lot of sense to have one of those two vehicles be an EV.\nSo I think as we get through this period and we go through with the potential pull ahead before 1 September where the consumer tax credit goes away, then we get to Q4, we'll probably see a little result of that pull ahead. We get into 2026, so I think we'll start to understand what real EV demand is. What we have been saying is what we're investing going forward is largely focused on improving our EV profitability. The announcements we've made from a battery perspective with LMR and LFP, some of the work that we're doing as we move forward to have a lighter architecture, more aerodynamic that allow us to use a smaller battery.\nSo we're very focused in this period of time to drive, not just get to variable profitability, but get to profitability and then continue to improve so we have appropriate and strong margins from our EVs as well. And then we're very well positioned to the market for later in this decade into next decade, and we truly offer consumers choice. So we think we've got the foundation with the EV platform that we have that allows us to go from a very small vehicle all the way up to a super truck like the HUMMER. We think that's an advantage for us. We think there is going to be an EV market that will grow over time, albeit it'll start lower and potentially grow more slowly. But we're well positioned to do that. Right now, we're seeing growth in both ICE and EV from a share perspective with, as Paul mentioned, very disciplined incentives.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nAnd there's a clear path to get the profitability on the affordable EVs?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nI'm sorry. I didn't hear the beginning of your question, Dan.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThere's a clear path to get the profitability on the affordable EVs?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, that is what we're working on from all aspects, and definitely the battery technology changes. And as we grow with affordable, which is in the heart of the market, that gets us the scale benefits as well. So we are focused on each and every vehicle getting to profitability, and we're not going to stop until they do.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the impact of tariffs on your earnings power as we move beyond this year. Earlier, you'd called out $4 to 5 billion of tariff impact over the course of Q2 through Q4 2024, Q1 2025. So annualizing to maybe $5.3 to 6.7 billion with the goal of mitigating at least 30% of the impact this year. But that was before the various investments in US manufacturing announced during the quarter. How should we think about these footprint actions impacting net tariff costs going forward? What degree of tariff cost mitigation beyond the 30% target for this year do you think you might be able to accomplish after these investments come online in 18 months' time?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nYeah. Good morning, Ryan. I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. We highlighted that of the $4 to 5 billion, about $2 billion of it is Korea. As Mary mentioned in her comments and recent question, that obviously the trade deals with Mexico, Canada, and Korea are going to be important. We're not speculating on what those are going to look like going forward, but there is a possibility and a likelihood, if you will, that ultimately a tariff rate gets set at a lower level, which would ultimately bring that impact down. As far as the other aspects of the tariffs, we talked about the $4 billion, which will bring us when all that is implemented to producing over 2 million vehicles here in the US. That will take care of a large part of the other remaining tariffs that are out there. We're still working through supply chain and other indirect tariffs, but we're not speculating on what it'll be.\nBut I expect that it is likely lower than the current run rate of what you would see just as things shake out. Remember, we're only 90 days into this. As to the 30%, I mean, these are shifts in sort of the general operation of the business that we don't necessarily think go away if tariffs are reduced. So I think we've got a longer-term plan to be able to mitigate a substantial part of this. We're obviously looking for things to normalize around these trade deals that will get done. And we expect that'll happen. But it's too soon to extrapolate that as a run rate into the future.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joe Spak with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning. Paul, just maybe turning back to some of the tariff comments. I understand a lot has changed. But you did mention that you expected the biggest headwind to be in the second quarter, and now it seems like the third quarter. So maybe you could just sort of help us understand what large buckets, what sort of changed within that. It seems like in the slide, you're mentioning indirect tariffs, which is maybe commodities, or maybe there's something with the mitigation efforts. Just any color you have there.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Joe. You got it. It's really on a lot of the indirect items that we were when we came out with the overall tariff guidance, we were estimating the timing on when some of that would hit. So I would expect that we would have more expense potentially in the third quarter, but we're still tracking on that four to five despite all the changes that we've seen going forward.\nSo it might be slightly higher in the third quarter, and that's kind of what we're thinking right now. On the cash side, we actually expect that cash impact potentially to be lower. We still didn't get the full benefit of the MSRP offset just because of the timing. So that'll materialize in the second half of the year on the cash side. But from an expense side, just think slightly higher in Q3, but still on track for the $4 to 5 billion for the year.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nOkay. And then just turning back to EVs and regulatory policy, but maybe from a little bit of a different angle. I know in your 10-K, you disclosed that last year you expensed $1 billion for credits. I was wondering if you'd let us know. It doesn't sound like you expect much sort of change to this year, but I was wondering if you could let us know how much you are counting on that expense to be this year. Is it fair to assume you have, if we're comparing 2026 to 2024, you have a potential $1 billion tailwind from credits?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nYeah, Joe. It gets really complicated really fast, as you might imagine, with the different regulatory schemes. But what's in there is CAFE, GHG, state regulations, etc. So what we know today is the CAFE penalties under the One Big Beautiful Bill were zeroed out. So we did have some balance sheet purchased credits that were there this year, but we also have some expenses that we had already booked. That's going to basically be a wash for us.\nI don't expect any material adjustments from CAFE. GHG, obviously, has not been fully answered. We have comments from the administration. In the One Big Beautiful Bill, there are changes to future compliance, but we're still working through that across the board. So I think 2025 is a little bit of a transition year as we understand what the future landscape is going to be and how that's going to affect the credits and the liabilities that are on the balance sheet this year. Going forward, we do expect to be a more, I guess, a lower expense rate for compliance in the future.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nAnd just, I would add to that, it also gives us the opportunity to sell EV vehicles or, excuse me, ICE vehicles for longer and appreciate the profitability of those vehicles while we're month by month, quarter by quarter, year by year improving our EV profitability. So I think it's a huge opportunity.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nEquity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just first on the guidance, just given still the wide range, second half of the year, $3.5 to 6 billion. I'm just curious what some of the factors that could materialize that could cause you to be at the low versus high end of that range and whether you have a current bias within the range currently.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nSo thanks, Itay. As we have continued to practice, as we generally use midpoint convention as how we're thinking about things, the reason to not change is obviously there's still things working out. We don't want a lot of volatility in our guidance from that standpoint. But as we look at the landscape, some of the things that could help us are getting some of the offsets as we've talked about, potentially overperforming on that. Some of the challenges are higher tariff rates for longer. But overall, we're aiming for the midpoint, and that's the way we try to shoot straight across the guidance. So as the year progresses, we'll have an opportunity to tighten that range as we know more.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nEquity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. That's helpful. Then just as a follow-up, just with wholesale volume declining on seasonality and you've gained some nice market share, your inventory's in good shape going into second half of the year. Any thoughts on where US dealer inventory could end the year roughly?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, I mean, we remain committed to our 50 to 60-day target at the end of the year. That obviously fluctuates with changes in demand, but clearly the vehicle count, as we highlighted in our comments, is down pretty significantly year over year. We have responded, I think, the right way with some component availability into our customer care and after-sales group to address some of the more specific warranty issues to make sure customers are getting their vehicles back faster.\nThat was a very calculated measure that impacted our wholesales, to be honest, and something that I think ultimately we can improve in the second half of the year that will have an ability to potentially improve our wholesales. But nothing has changed from that target of wanting to get to that 50- to 60-day target rate.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nEquity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nTerrific. That's all very helpful. Thank you.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Itay.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, everybody. Mary, about 15 or 20 years ago, GM was leading the industry in humanoid robot development, working together with NASA on Robonaut 1 and then Robonaut 2, deploying an upper body humanoid on the International Space Station in 2011. Fast forward to today, and most of your key competitors have a humanoid program.\nMany, myself included, think that this market's 10 times larger than cars, at least. So when can investors learn more about GM's robotics chops and your in-house robot facilities? Mary, as an engineer, I'm sure you must be super excited about the opportunity to show investors where GM can dominate here. Mary, I actually think that this is good for the UAW because we need American human muscle to develop, build, and service these robots. So when are we going to learn more?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, Adam, thanks. I actually didn't work directly on that project, but it was in the area I was responsible for. So I know the NASA partnership you're talking about very well. Also, we have a very long and rich history with GMF or, excuse me, GM Robotics, GM Fun Up, sorry. We still have a very, very strong partnership.\nSo we have a core capability in the company for sure. There's also partnerships that we're looking at and strategic relations that we have. But as we look at automation overall, our first look is we want to not only lead from what happens from a robotics perspective, because remember, a lot of things that we leverage robotics for are areas where there's safety challenges to do the work. If there's ergo challenges, we have a very robust ergonomics program in this company to make sure people don't get hurt doing their jobs. And then just difficult or very dirty tasks that, frankly, no one wants to do, and I don't blame them. And so there's a lot to do there. There's also work to do to get rid of a lot of the indirect. But we've also done a lot of work from a winning with simplicity perspective.\nWe've talked about that for the last few years. But first has been focused on what was, I'll say, some of the low-hanging fruit to simplify how we go to market from a trip level perspective, free flow options, etc. But now we're really getting into part design where the parts are just simpler parts or a part that integrates and does more functions. So there's tremendous work going on across the company to lead to manufacturing efficiency. And then, like I said, as we go forward, we're going to continue to capitalize on the core knowledge that we have in this company to make sure we're driving efficiency.\nI'm also very proud of the fact that way back when, when assembly lines and all the equipment in a plant was controlled by wires and relays, we did training programs partnering with the local community colleges to train our workforce to be able to leverage how we run automation today. From a computer perspective, we have an active training program right now where we're training more and more electricians and technicians as we have more complexity in our plants. And so we're going to continue to do that. Something I'm very proud of. And I do agree there's huge opportunity for our workforce as we look to what technology has to offer to improve the jobs. But overall, we're focused on what's going to drive manufacturing optimization across all elements.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "That's great, Mary. That sounds like stay tuned and bless you for investing in those important areas in our country. Just as a follow-up on EV profitability, I want to return to that. Tesla is still seen as the benchmark in Western EVs by many. Maybe you're now the new benchmark or the new emerging benchmark. But in Western EVs, they're still the big dog. But if you remove ZEV credits, which is probably appropriate, and downstream retail, they're loss-making. I mean, they're worse than Renault. Their margins are worse than Stellantis. They would really love to have your GMI margins. So add this to Elon's that seems to be also exiting the auto industry, clearly pulling capital out of the business and doubling down on AI and autonomy and robotaxis. So how does GM expect to be profitable with EVs when players like Tesla apparently cannot?\nI was just wondering what you'd highlight as your differentiation in terms of how you configure the vehicles or your scale or something about working with the Koreans and your in-house work. When you benchmark Tesla, why are they loss-making and you feel that you can be profitable? Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, I think one of the things I'm very proud of that I'm not going to comment on Tesla because there's a lot there. And as you know, I don't usually comment on competitors. But I think when I look specifically at General Motors, one of the reasons our EVs are doing so well from a customer perspective is they're true to our brands, whether it's Chevrolet, whether it's Cadillac, whether it's GMC HUMMER, and GMC.\nAlso, beautifully designed vehicles that have the range and the performance that customers are looking for, whether you're talking about a truck or all the technology and safety we put into an Equinox. That's what we're known for and the beautiful design with also efficiency. As Paul said in his opening remarks, we still believe we have tremendous opportunity to, as we did our first EV platform, to make changes to that to drive more efficiency from a weight perspective, from a simplification perspective. The same is true for batteries, and we're investing in future technologies that are going to allow us to take significant cost out. And then we will get scale. And one of the things I'm really excited about with how we have been growing our share quarter after quarter is the support that we have from our dealers who now really understand EVs.\nThey understand what the customer is looking for. Like I said, I think we can improve that scale when we think about two-car families that have an opportunity to have one of those vehicles in the garage, BEV, even before the charging infrastructure is there. So it's going to be beautifully designed products with brands people trust. Remember, we have the highest loyalty. It's going to be having the right technology on the vehicle, getting that scale, and then the engineering solutions. So I'm very bullish on where we're going to be on EVs as we continue to move forward in the next couple of years.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nAdam, I'll just add too. I think the other asset that we have is, a lot is made about Tesla's simplicity and their scale. Clearly, within a couple of narrow segments, they do have that, and they've realized some good advantages, and hats off to them. It also leaves them overexposed to a demand set that has been highly volatile. When you look at what we've done in Spring Hill and what we've announced that we're going to do in Fairfax, we're increasingly building flexibility into our operation, into our manufacturing plants that as we go through this period of transition, however long it might be, where customers are adopting EVs at a slower or a faster rate, that is going to change year to year for the foreseeable future.\nThat built-in flexibility for us to switch between EV and ICE and make sure that we meet customers where they are is an inherent advantage that we have because we can absorb some of the costs of that manufacturing facility with more ICE production if EV demand goes down. So that flexibility is going to be important for us as we go through the next several years, and I think is going to be helpful on that journey.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Paul. Thanks, Mary.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Adam.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tom Narayan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst of Global Autos, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question, ma'am. I wanted to do a little more maybe drilling down on the Korea operation you guys have. I know it's a substantial part of the tariff amount, obviously. I know we all hope for a resolution there. But the cost dynamics there are better, I believe, than if you were to produce those vehicles in the US. Just curious, in a worst-case scenario situation where we're at the current status quo and that continues prospectively, how do you think about the Korean business? Is the better economics there sufficient that you could continue working with the same kind of production, same capacity, or would you make changes there? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nYeah, Tom, we really have to see where this levels out. I mean, we've had the operation in Korea for a very, very long time. It's a very efficient operation that we're very proud of. But we've got to evaluate when we have some certainty with what the tariff will be. So I'm not going to speculate. Obviously, we've talked about it with the different choices that we have.\nBut I'm not going to speculate right now until we know where the agreement between Korea and the United States lands. But it's an operation we've had for a long time that's very efficient and high quality. Again, as I mentioned, right now, the vehicles that we produce there, they're in high demand, and they still are contribution margin positive. So I think we're in the right place where we are right now until we get more certainty, and then we'll have more to say about it.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst of Global Autos, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGot it. And then as you think about outside the US, China looks like it was maybe a surprise positively at your performance there despite all the negativity we hear in the press with the domestics there. But then the flip side in Europe, you're hearing a lot of negativity from large OEMs this week with all the competition there.\nHow do you think about these two markets for GM? Is it better just to kind of hunker down and stay more focused in the US where you guys are so dominant? Or do you see opportunities, especially with the EV side, as battery costs coming down in the future presents a great opportunity for you guys to kind of expand further in those two markets? Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, I think from a China perspective, now that we announced the restructuring last year and it's on track, very proud of the fact that the team is gaining share. I think we're the only foreign OEM or foreign brands to be able to gain share, positive equity income. I think there's an opportunity with what we know today from the geopolitical situation and the relationship between the two countries. I think there's an opportunity for Cadillac and Buick to be strong there.\nBuick has a rich history there, and the brand means something to the Chinese consumer. Cadillac is viewed as luxury and a great choice. I mean, one of the vehicles we have there is the GL8, which has been a very, very successful product. Now that we have it out from a new energy vehicle perspective, it's doing quite well. So I think with what we know today, we can have a smaller but strong business that can grow in China. I think that's something that we're going to be continuing to focus on. I'm really proud of the team there. From a Europe perspective, I think there's a lot of changes that are happening in Europe right now from a regulatory perspective, from what's happening from a competition perspective, especially from the Chinese. I think over time that will settle out.\nWe think we have an opportunity in that market. Very proud of the fact that the Lyriq was named German Luxury Car of the Year last year, first American brand to ever receive that honor. So I think we have, especially our EVs, that can do very well in the European market. But I think there's some stabilization that has to happen of what is the policy situation across Europe that will inform the next step we take. Then you didn't mention South America. I think we have huge opportunity from a South America perspective. We have very strong brands there, a very strong dealer base. I think there's opportunity there as well, as well as in the Middle East.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director, Senior Autos, and Auto Tech Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask you about the share buyback program. It's good to see GM back in the markets, buying some on the open market. Can you give us any sense of how much you're hoping or planning to buy in the second half? I believe you still have $4 billion+, maybe on the authorization.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nSo, Emmanuel, good morning. Thanks for the question. First of all, we never left the market. As you know, we were covering with the accelerated share repurchase in Q2. That's been consistent. While we paused open market repurchases, we have said that we're back now, and we began repurchasing in early July. No comment specifically on how much we're going to do. We obviously wouldn't telegraph that.\nBut you're right. We had, as of the end of the quarter, $4.3 billion remaining on that authorization. And as we've said, we're sticking with our free cash flow guide. And you would expect that seasonally, there's going to be more cash generation in the second half versus what we did according to that guide when you look at the midpoint. So I'll just leave it at that. But we are going to maintain that consistent application of our capital allocation policy.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director, Senior Autos, and Auto Tech Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, great. And then second topic, I was hoping to ask you a follow-up about this follow-up on your EV strategy as a result of some of these US regulation changes. I appreciate all the efforts that you highlighted towards flexible manufacturing and the ability to really respond to consumer demand.\nIs there also an opportunity or appetite at GM to try and reduce the overall capital intensity of the business? Obviously, your CapEx remains very stable and steady. Just curious if with this lower EV market predicted as well as essentially easier rules to follow, if there is any appetite there to actually just say, \"Well, maybe down the line at some point, we don't need to spend as much on a go-forward basis as an overall company\"?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, Emmanuel, I think from a capital perspective, I feel very comfortable with where we are at the 10 to 11. And then we've announced that with the footprint changes that we'll go to 10 to 12 over the next couple of years, but still very much in line with affordability, balanced capital allocation, and capital levels that on an inflation-adjusted basis are similar to what we did in 2018 with much better cash flow performance. So when you look at EVs, I wouldn't say that we're going to be spending significantly less.\nWhat I would say is the composition of the investment is changing, where we have been out expanding the portfolio and making sure that we can meet customers where they are. Our capital is now focused on where can we structurally and architecturally improve the costs and the performance. A lot of announcements that we've made on the battery technology, and the teams are hard at work at looking at other things such as aero and materials. So I think there's a path there and one that we feel very comfortable with.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director, Senior Autos, and Auto Tech Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks for the color.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Emmanuel.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, thank you. And I want to thank everybody for your attention and for your questions. We really do appreciate the dialogue. But I hope you step back and see that we are well-positioned for the future. We have a lot of momentum with customers as we adapt to the changing markets, trade, and tax policy, and we are demonstrating leadership in ICE, EVs, software, AV, and other important technologies for the future of mobility.\nThis underscores my belief that GM will emerge from this transition period even stronger financially and with clear momentum, and that we will be uniquely differentiated from our competitors with the strength of our ICE business, the strength of our EV business, and the progress that I know we're going to be making from a technology perspective. Thanks, everybody. I hope you have a great day and be safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."

We are asking analysts to limit their questions to one, and a brief follow up.\nTo ask a question, please press star, and then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star, and then two. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Thursday, 1 May 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Motors\n\nThanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2025. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO, and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Susan Sheffield, President and CEO of GM Financial, who has taken over from Dan Berce after his recent retirement, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOn today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, thanks Ashish and good morning everyone. I want to thank you for joining today's call which was as you all know originally scheduled for Tuesday. We've had continual discussions with the President and his team since before the inauguration and had a good understanding of the President's plans heading into this week. But we felt it was important to hold this call after official actions were taken so we could have a more productive discussion with all of you. We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US auto industry. The administration invested the time to understand what it takes to be successful in this capital-intensive and highly competitive global industry, how we can work together to strengthen and grow American manufacturing, and the importance of companies like GM to communities across the country.\nAlmost one million people in the US depend on GM for their livelihood, including our employees, suppliers, and dealers. We have a network of 50 US manufacturing plants and part facilities in 19 states, which includes 11 vehicle assembly plants. We've invested $60 billion here over the last five years. Our business is growing and will continue to grow our investment in this country as we move forward. With the policy clarity we now have, we are updating our full year EBIT adjusted guidance to a range of $10 to 12.5 billion, including a current tariff exposure of $4 to 5 billion. Paul will address this more from a detailed perspective in a few minutes.\nWe look forward to maintaining our strong dialogue with the administration on trade and other policies as they continue to evolve. As you know, there are ongoing discussions with key trade partners that may also have an impact. We will continue to be nimble and disciplined and keep you updated as we know more. Over the last several years we have been preparing for shifts in global trade policy by strengthening our US manufacturing capability and supply chains. Since 2019, we have increased our direct purchases in the US for North American production by 27%, and the content in our US assembled vehicles is more than 80% USMCA compliant.\nIn addition, we have reduced our direct material spend in China for US production to less than 3% and we have grown to become the largest battery cell manufacturer in the US through our joint venture plants in Ohio and Tennessee. As tariff policy came into focus, we increased full-size pickup production at our Fort Wayne truck plant, which was already running three shifts, by approximately 50,000 units on an annualized basis, and we are developing plans to further increase US vehicle production. GM teams are also working directly with our suppliers to further increase their US content and drive even higher levels of USMCA compliance, and we are increasing production of US-assembled battery modules, a low-cost way to increase US content.\nAlongside these actions, we are scrutinizing our discretionary spending everywhere, and we are taking steps to ensure that we stay aligned with a strong consumer demand for our ICE vehicles and the evolving regulatory environment around vehicle emissions. Some of these steps include extending production of the Cadillac XT5 at the Spring Hill assembly plant in Tennessee through the end of 2026. We're also focused on growing our EV business responsibly. We have some of the best and most successful EVs on the market today, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV and the Cadillac Lyriq. To protect our brands, we have moderated EV production to ensure that we stay aligned with the consumer demand to avoid the heavy discounts our competitors offer. This will reduce our scale driven profitability improvement, but we need to follow the consumer.\nWe're also focusing our EV investments on greater efficiency and cost reductions across the value chain. Instead of further portfolio expansion, we've announced an agreement to sell our share of the Ultium Cells plant in Lansing to LG Energy Solution, which will result in us recouping our capital investment. In addition, we'll continue to execute our plan to develop US sources for battery, cell, and electric motor inputs like lithium, rare earth metals, permanent magnets, and cathode active material. Many of our supply chain initiatives are coming online later this year or early next year. In 2027, we expect our joint venture with Lithium Americas to open Phase 1 of the Thacker Pass project in Nevada, and we are contracted for 100% of that offtake.\nGM's business is fundamentally strong as we adapt to the new trade policy environment. Great execution is driving sales and market share growth with consistently lower incentives, lower inventory, and solid margins. I'm very proud of our employees, our dealers, and our suppliers for their hard work in Q1. We gained almost two full points of market share year-over-year in the US which outpaced every other major automaker. In addition, our first quarter share of the US EV market was 10% and rose to 12% in March, solidifying our position as the number two EV seller.\nOur Q1 margin in North America was 8.8%, well within our 8% to 10 range target range. Despite the addition of Cruise expenses, our momentum is broad based. Chevrolet became the fastest growing EV brand. Cadillac gained ICE and EV market share both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4. Our redesigned ICE SUVs including the Chevrolet Equinox, Traverse, and Tahoe are hits because customers love their design, performance, and value.\nImportantly, they are more profitable than the prior generation thanks to our focus on capital efficiency, complexity reduction, and manufacturing efficiencies. In addition, sales of our redesigned Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon were up more than 30% and the Cadillac Escalade had its best ever first quarter thanks to a combination of new gas-powered model and the all-electric IQ. In their review of the Escalade IQ, MotorTrend said it may be the best luxury machine Cadillac has ever built, which speaks volumes about design, performance, technology, and everything we're delivering in that vehicle. The success of these products also supports the 2025 Super Cruise growth targets that we outlined in January, which include doubling the number of Super Cruise equipped vehicles on the road and we're off to a good start.\nIn the first quarter we expanded our Super Cruise equipped fleet by more than 100% year-over-year or about 230,000 units. Tariffs had a relatively small impact in Q1, and there were other headwinds, and one-time factors that impacted the results which we will discuss. They included some cost pressures and lower full-size pickup wholesales because of planned downtime for plant upgrades. Behind the scenes, our supply chain team worked with speed and agility during the quarter to overcome the effects of a fire at a supplier factory that could have severely impacted production of full-size pickups and SUVs. As things played out, we were able to quickly move some of the production and recover and repair tools from the damaged site, limiting the impact to about 7,000 units in the quarter. All of these units are expected to be recovered in the second quarter.\nThe team in China also deserves recognition for delivering positive equity income while restructuring the business. They are launching very competitive new products and growing sales volume and market share. For example, all new Buicks launched in China will be launching in China starting in the second half of this year, and they will be new energy vehicles, and the premium models will be marketed under the Electra sub-brand. They will also lead the development of a sophisticated ADAS, smart cockpit, and chassis designs across our Chinese vehicle portfolio. As I said, we started the year strong after growing revenues 9% and delivering record results in 2024. Because the fundamentals of our business remain strong, we managed everything under our control, and we continue to thoughtfully plan for the future.\nThis includes developing our next generation software-defined vehicle platform, which will be simpler but have even more capability. It includes adding new features and products developed by our software and services team. We will also continue to grow and enhance the capabilities of Super Cruise, the industry's best L2 driver assistance technology. We will also develop L3 and even more advanced automated autonomous technologies in collaboration with the team from Cruise. Leveraging the economies of scale we have made us the OEM producer of lithium-ion cells in the US and we're introducing new battery chemistries and form factors that will deliver the EV range and performance our customers have come to expect from GM with even lower pack costs, improved profitability.\nFinally, we're continuing to deploy AI solutions across the business. This includes exciting collaboration with NVIDIA on next-generation vehicles, factories, and robots using AI simulation and accelerated computing. You'll hear more about these profit-driven, value-creating initiatives throughout the year. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nThank you, Mary. Appreciate you all joining us this morning. Our robust vehicle portfolio combined with our continued disciplined market strategy has once again delivered solid financial results. Our Q1 US sales growth outpaced every other major automaker. US deliveries were up 17% year-over-year, and our market share grew to 17.2%, marking a nearly 2-point improvement from the prior year, all while maintaining incentives around 300 basis points below the industry average. We ended the quarter with ICE US dealer inventory of 49 days, down from 53 days at the end of Q4.\nInventory is turning quickly, and nearly 90% of the inventory at quarter end was comprised of model year 2025. As we all know, we're witnessing a significant shift in policy under the new administration, and we are encouraged by the President's recent actions to strengthen the auto industry. As Mary outlined, we have already implemented several no regret strategies to mitigate some of the impact, with additional measures being evaluated. Adapting to this dynamic environment will take some time, but we remain confident in our ability to respond effectively and offset at least 30% of our exposure. We believe our product portfolio and continued strong demand for our vehicles positions us ahead of the competition during this period of transition.\nLet me begin by summarizing our Q1 results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $44 billion, up 2% year-over-year, with wholesales also up 2%. We achieved $3.5 billion in EBIT adjusted, 7.9% EBIT adjusted margins, and $2.7 billion, or $2.78 in EPS diluted adjusted. Our EBIT adjusted was down slightly from last year's Q1 performance. Let me walk you through some of the key items on the bridge. Pricing was up around $900 million year-over-year, demonstrating our ongoing disciplined market strategy as well as continued strong demand for our products like the new midsize SUV family, the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, and Buick Enclave, as well as our compact SUVs, the Chevy Equinox, and GMC Terrain.\nLet's turn to volume and mix. Wholesale volumes of light-duty full-size trucks declined year-over-year, largely due to a few weeks of scheduled downtime at our full-size truck plants for upgrades along with the effects of the supplier fire that Mary mentioned earlier. However, this was more than offset by the Chevy Trax and Buick Envista delivering exceptional year-over-year growth, propelling us to a leading position in the US small SUV segment. In EVs we achieved over 90% year-over-year growth, securing the number two position in the US. Models like the Equinox EV are gaining meaningful traction with mainstream customers. Meanwhile, Cadillac continues its own momentum with EVs now accounting for 20% of its US sales.\nFX was a headwind of around $300 million in the quarter, primarily attributable to weakness in the Mexican peso. Fixed costs were up $400 million year-over-year due to higher depreciation and amortization, ongoing warranty pressure, and higher labor costs, partially offset by the reductions at Cruise. Relative to warranty costs, we face persistent inflation challenges and are also taking voluntary measures to address the 6.2-liter L87 engine supplier quality issues in some model year 2021-2024 vehicles. The good news is that dealers have already begun applying the remedy to vehicles in their position. It's the right thing to do for our customers.\nDespite around $500 million of incremental expenses for the L87 in Q2, we expect warranty to still be a slight year-over-year tailwind in 2025. We are focused on maintaining our cost discipline. Comparisons become easier as the year progresses, and we expect fixed costs, including crudes but excluding depreciation and amortization, to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2025. Now let's move to North America. Notwithstanding higher wholesales quarter-over-quarter, US dealer inventories were down in part due to a meaningful step up in the SAAR throughout the quarter.\nThe industry undoubtedly benefited from some pull ahead demand from customers purchasing vehicles ahead of potential tariff impacts, particularly in March. But this strong demand has continued into April where we've seen US deliveries up around 20% versus last year. Q1 margin was 8.8%, well within our 8% to 10 target range, despite the additions of the expenses that were formerly approved. With respect to our international business, GM International EBIT Adjusted excluding China equity income was breakeven in a seasonally low quarter, influenced in part by this year's timing of holidays in the Middle East. China equity income reached nearly $50 million.\nThe team in China, including our JV partner, have made significant strides in reducing inventory and costs while also focusing on enhancing the competitiveness of our products. Their efforts are yielding results as evidenced by a third consecutive quarter of sequential market share growth. Notably, sales of our new energy vehicles increased 53% year-over-year. GM Financial also performed well with Q1 EBT adjusted of almost $700 million in line with last year. Higher provision expense from increased loan origination volume was partially offset by higher net financing revenue and leased vehicle income. GM Financial continues its proven track record of profitability and consistent capital returned to GM with another $350 million dividend paid during the quarter.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on tariffs. Beginning in early April, a 25% vehicle import tariff was imposed for vehicles that are USMCA compliant, which all of our North American produced vehicles are. The US content is not subject to the tariff once the necessary administrative processes are implemented in the coming weeks. Since the election, our manufacturing and supply chain teams have been focused on developing strategies to help mitigate the impact of potential tariffs. These strategies are now actively being put into action.\nMary mentioned a few of these examples in her remarks. We'll take additional mitigation measures, including cost reduction targets where it makes sense to do so. We're reviewing the cost initiatives that were implemented during COVID, but we want to ensure that we don't cut too deep. The environment is very different today than COVID as demand remains quite strong. They've also announced tariffs on imported parts. While we source parts globally, our guiding principle is to buy where we build.\nThe US is GM's primary location for sourcing parts supply for US assembly, comprising well over half of its annual parts expenditure. Steel and aluminum are largely sourced local to production. We have a proven track record of working collaboratively with our suppliers to navigate industry challenges, and we anticipate that this occasion, as we work to increase US sourcing further, will be no different. By working together, guided by transparency and trust, we are carefully evaluating the actions we can take with our suppliers to help mitigate the impact on their business.\nOne of Tuesday's presidential actions will provide a tariff offset based on the more than 1.5 million vehicles we build in the US each year. This will help mitigate a substantial portion of tariffs on parts going into those vehicles and help avoid added costs on US vehicle production. This offset program supplements, but does not replace continued preferential treatment for USMCA compliant parts. The other action will ensure that tariffs on parts don't stack on top of each other. We believe both of these are smart policies that help encourage companies to do more in the US while also ensuring satisfactory return on invested capital.\nNow let's move to our 2025 guidance based on Q1 results. Our underlying business trends remain strong and would have kept us on track with the initial guidance that was given on the Q4 earnings call, with better pricing offsetting warranty and FX headwinds. Post clarity from the presidential actions of Tuesday, we are expecting a $4 to 5 billion impact from tariffs. This includes about $2 billion coming from vehicles we import from Korea, as well as tariffs on vehicle imports from Mexico and Canada, in addition to indirect material imports. Based on the current commercial environment, our updated guidance assumes we can offset at least 30% of this headwind via self-help initiatives.\nThis results in EBIT adjusted in the $10 to 12.5 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $8.25 to 10 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $7.5 to 10 billion range. Pricing was strong in Q1 as well as during the month of April. We now expect pricing to be relatively consistent for the remainder of the year. As a result, we expect North American pricing to be up 0.5 point to 1% year-over-year versus our prior guidance of being down 1% to 1.5. On the EV side, we have a strong portfolio and saw significant year-over-year growth in both volume and US share in Q1. We maintained our number two position in the US market notwithstanding the US.\nEV industry moderation from the Q4 last year to the first quarter this year. Going forward, we will continue to remain disciplined and manage EV production in line with demand. Inventory levels for EVs remained reasonable at 78 days at quarter end, and our EV incentives continue to be well below the industry average. We are continuing our momentum on EV profitability improvement in the first quarter. Nearly 50% of our entries were variable profit positive. The portfolio was near break even on variable profit primarily due to a mix of production during the quarter.\nGoing forward, we expect to continue to make progress on our EBITDA improvement journey, but the actual year-over-year improvement is going to depend on total volumes and tariffs. With crude operations now included in North America, we are continuing to target at least $500 million in year-over-year savings in 2025 versus 2024. We anticipate commodities to be relatively flat year-over-year, while rates for steel and aluminum have increased recently. These are somewhat mitigated by our limited exposure to index prices for GM International. We expect a tailwind from restructuring the China business, and are continuing to target profitable equity income for the full year. GM International outside of China should be similar to what was delivered in 2024.\nWe expect higher profitability in the second half driven by seasonality and some new launches. For GM Financial, we continue to expect EBIT adjusted in the $2.5 to 3 billion range, and we also continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $10 to 11 billion, including battery JV investments. Finally, I'd like to turn to capital allocation. Let me start by reiterating that there is no change to our capital allocation policy. We continue to balance investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning capital to our shareholders. Investing in our business to optimize long-term profitable growth remains our top priority.\nOur balance sheet is strong. On 1 April we paid off $500 million of senior notes, which leaves another $1.25 billion maturing later this year. We will assess refinancing opportunities or debt extinguishment as we progress through the year. We have also entered into an agreement with Ultium Cells to provide a $1.8 billion five-year term loan that will facilitate a full voluntary prepayment of all remaining amounts under the US Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing. We are grateful for the support of everyone at the local, state, and federal level who helped make these plans possible. Going forward, the JV's simplified capital structure will allow it to grow and evolve with even greater flexibility.\nBack in February, we announced a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, retiring 33 million shares immediately. The total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the ASR program will be determined upon final settlement, which is expected to conclude this quarter. We ended the first quarter with a diluted share count of 983 million shares, down 15% compared to the end of the first quarter last year. GM has $4.3 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization, but we are temporarily pausing additional repurchases until we have more certainty with respect to our operating environment.\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to every member of the GM team for delivering another great quarter. Although the current environment poses challenges, we will navigate this evolving landscape with the same agility and resilience that have defined our successful responses to past industry disruptions. Thank you and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to analysts, we are asking that you limit your questions to one and a brief follow-up so that we may get to everyone on the call. To ask a question, press star and then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star and then two. Our first question comes from Itay Michaeli with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thank you. Good morning everyone. Just had one tariff question and one follow up on tariffs. With this week's relief on parts tariffs, is there scope for the industry to also receive similar relief on the imported vehicle tariffs? How should we think about the plan for full mitigation of tariffs and maybe how long it would take roughly?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nHey, good morning, Itay. Thanks for the question. Look, as we said in the comments, the environment remains fluid, and we're hopeful that the administration is going to continue to work on trade agreements across the world, and we'll continue to assess that going forward. As far as offsets, you know, I think, you know, we've said it'll take a little bit of time to implement particularly the, any manufacturing or supply chain moves. I think that was evident in what the President did with, you know, kind of two year rolling relief here with the, with the offsets. We're going to work actively to try to find the optimal way to do that across the board.\nWe've really looked at addressing the tariffs are offset mitigation in three buckets. One is go to market. When you look at where the environment is right now, you know, we feel good about where pricing is versus where we started the year. That's been evidenced by what you saw in the first quarter as well as what continued into April. We've assumed pricing remains constant from here. We do expect the SAAR to come down a little bit off of the, you know, the peaks that we're seeing right now, but still in line with our full year target that we started with about 16 million units for the rest of the year.\nThe second bucket is cost reductions. As we talked about, we've pulled out the COVID playbook. It'll take some time to roll those things in. We don't want to panic, we don't want to overcut because it is a very different environment than COVID and we want to make sure that we're investing in our great products portfolio. Then lastly is the footprint responses and supply chain responses, et cetera. That's what's going to take a little bit of time. As we continue to go through, we'll provide more detail on our progress on each of those.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThat's very helpful, Paul. A quick follow-up, big picture question. With all the disruptions we've seen in new vehicle production in the last four years, how does that shape your pace of investments in AV and AI to capture more of that installed base revenue? Maybe to that, if you could provide an update on like the timing of the next-gen software defined vehicle platform and maybe some of the L3 offerings you're working with the Cruise team. Thank you.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, so when you look at, I mean the timing, we have successfully integrated the Cruise team into working with the GM team, and it's going quite well. We're going to talk more about what the timeline is for the software defined vehicle, as well as continuing to make improvements and getting to L3 from an AV technology perspective. What we're committed to do in the meantime, to keep adding features to Super Cruise. Hopefully everybody saw that it was just stated as the best driver assistance technology by MotorTrend.\nWe're going to continue to add features like we have towing right now. No one else in the industry has towing with their L2. We can go to L2, L2 plus, and then on the way to 3. We'll share more about the actual timing for it later this year. I would just say on the software-defined vehicle, there's already been tremendous progress made in our software development process and, more importantly, our software validation process. It has led to simplicity and less variations of the software that is allowing us to dramatically improve the quality and improve the speed of putting additional services and things that our customers will value.\nThat's all on the way to the whole next generation of SDV. Again, more to follow on that later in the year. Then the first part of your question, EK, was.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nJust at the pace of AV AI investment, it sounds like you're accelerating those in light of all the disruptions we've seen in the last few years?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, we're going to continue to invest because we think autonomy is so important. Again, improving L3 all the way to L4. That's why we did the change that we announced last year with Cruise because we really want to focus on personal autonomy, and that's going to be, I think, very important and a differentiator from a technology perspective as we go forward. From an artificial intelligence perspective.\nWe announced the partnership we had with NVIDIA. We have many other partnerships going on because we think we can leverage AI to make our business much more efficient and faster. Those are continuing. We just hired a new head of AI who's working across each area of the business. Each of my directs has a goal to demonstrate how they're leveraging AI to either improve the way we do business or the cost of how we do business. Very active on that front.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nTerrific. That's all very helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joe Spak with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning everyone. Just wondered if we could sort of get a little bit more? Details on some of the guidance. The guidance was lowered by $3.5 billion. Seems like you're saying about a $4.5 billion tariff impact.\nI'm assuming that's the gross number but includes the reimbursement mechanism. If you could confirm that, and then the 30% mitigation you said is from self help, does that include the pricing or not? Because the pricing assumption looks to be like +$3 billion versus the prior guide. If that's the case, I'm just wondering what may be some of the other offsets are.\nIt doesn't sound like volume is that much of a change. I don't know if there's anything in warranty or. I know you sort of changed some of the language on EV improvement as well. Maybe you could just help us with some of those factors.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Good morning, Joe. Frst of all, on the tariff calculation, it really is a straight $4 to 5 billion, which is the expected tariff after the actions, including the offset mechanism that the President signed with reduced by 30%, which is our self-help initiatives that I described earlier. That was the metric that we did and kind of rounded it off into the 10 to 12.5 range. That was the genesis of how we calculated as pricing goes. You know, I want to be clear, we haven't assumed any increases in pricing.\nThe pricing that we've seen year to date, the current environment of where we sit has been somewhat offset by continued warranty pressure and some other FX challenges that we've seen. But when you net all that together, I think we feel good about where the pricing environment is today. We're obviously going to continue to watch it, but we're not banking on any additional pricing beyond what we've already seen in the market.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay, perfect. That's a good segue to the second question, which is, I know you're assuming pricing holds. I guess it is obviously, I think, a change versus what your guidance was before. But even going forward and holding it at this level. You've over the past couple of years, I think, been very disciplined on pricing and not chasing volume.\nI'm wondering how you just think about potential pricing actions going forward, especially given what maybe some competitors might do. Is there greater risk that there's pricing actions because there's obviously different cost structures in the industry versus what was even a couple months ago.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nWell, Joe, a lot to unpack there. What I would say is over the past few years we have seen a lot of pricing actions by our competitors, whether it be inventory driven or campaign driven. It's been clear that. Our competitors have generally carried much higher inventory than we have. Despite the fact that we've operated very independently with our, with our own pricing, our own go-to-market approach, we've continued to get share in the industry, and we've done it the right way.\nWe've expanded margins, we've reduced incentives. We're not buying share. It's coming to us because of our vehicle portfolio. So, you know, we've seen other actions by competitors, including discounting that might continue. At the end of the day, our strategy has worked really, really well for us, and it's that disciplined approach that I think has led to our outperformance relative to others.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you so much. Just to make sure I understand the tariff offsets. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what is going into that 30% plus offset from self help? Is it truly sort of like that discipline on pricing? Is it cost?\nWhat sort of costs are you able to take out quickly so that you would still get all that benefit within 2025? I guess broadly what goes into those tariff offsets for this year?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThanks, Emmanuel. As Paul said, it is self help. It's one taking steps like we did to add volume to Fort Wayne to build 50,000 more full size trucks on an annualized basis that's already in place. It's building more battery modules in this country. We already built all the cells in this country, but battery, battery modules, that's more content in the United States. That improves the tariff position, and there's things like that that we're going to continue to look and do.\nThen it's working with our supply base to make sure they're USMCA compliant first off. Then to look for opportunities with our suppliers where we can leverage capacity in this country that they have. To build more from a US perspective. Then as Paul said, the third is discipline within the company as we face a challenge like this. We delivered the message, even as we ended last year and reinforced it earlier in the week, that we need everybody to show great discretion on discretionary spending. That message is resonating.\nWe're going to be effective. We're going to, as Paul said, continue to invest in our great product portfolio, both ICE and EV. Our investments in EV will be primarily focused on improving our cost structure. There's a lot of things that we can do to build on what is already a very strong, greater than 80% USMCA-compliant. The lion's share of that is US content. We're going to continue on what we've been doing from a battery, raw materials, and supply chain resiliency.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks, those steps that we took and started a couple of years ago are going to pay off this year and into next year, and then into even 2027 from a lithium perspective. It's just fundamentally having a resilient supply chain. As Paul said, it's from a supply perspective, it's by where we build. It's working on improving US content, and it's being very cost focused.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, thanks for the caller. Then as we look beyond this here, can you confirm this $4 to 5 billion impact? This is essentially what you're getting from nine months of the year. You would have potentially something larger, sort of like as you move forward and therefore need potentially larger offsets. In this context, talk to us of what you would be considering in terms of larger offsets. I'm particularly curious if there's room to reduce fixed costs within your EV spend in particular.\nObviously this administration is relaxing the rules. The Congress seems to be potentially going after even California's ability to have its own waiver. Does that enable you potentially to take some fixed cost out on the powertrain side and on the EV investment?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, Emmanuel, you raise a really good point. We are monitoring carefully what's happened, and as from an emissions regulatory perspective. Right now nothing's changed. We need to make sure that we're compliant until whatever actions are taken from a reconciliation process or what actions are taken by the EPA and NHTSA. We are evaluating our spend, and as I already mentioned, we're going to focus on how do we make our EVs more cost effective. We reaffirmed our capital being in that 10 to 11 range.\nWe're going to work within that as we deploy smart capital that's going to generate the right return, that may be increasing what we do in the US, continuing to invest in our strong internal combustion engine portfolio, and improving the efficiency of our EVs, but we're going to work within our dollar amount. You could make the conclusion, as we deploy some capital from an investment in the US perspective, that's going to have to come from somewhere. We think we can do what we have planned to do with all three of those components within the guidance we already gave.\nThat's what we're focused on doing, but making bigger, broader decisions. It's not really smart to do that until we really know what the regulatory environment's going to be. Because as you well know, the cost of noncompliance that varies across the different agencies is pretty significant. We're going to work on compliance until the regime changes.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks so much. Then Paul, can you just confirm on the $4 to 5 billion, is that net or gross of these 30% litigation. Am I correct in understanding that on a full year basis this would be larger?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nEmmanuel, the $4 to 5 billion is our estimated impact after the President's actions for 2025. It does not include the 30% offsets that we talked about. Lastly, we're not giving any color on 2026. There are lots of things that are going to change between now and 2026. We'll provide more detail as the environment continues to evolve.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to double click on volume, please. Maybe you could just unpack the views on SAAR, which said you still think can be 16 million, and then maybe you can address just from the volume perspective. You know, just under half of the vehicles you sell in the US are assembled outside of the US. How do you manage those, specifically the affordable products and those that are coming from Korea? Thank you.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah, so Dan, I'll take the first part. You know, our assumption on, you know, SAR for the rest of the year is essentially reverting back to our business plan. So, you know, we've obviously enjoyed a nice tailwind with March, you know, being just above 18, April approaching 18 from the early numbers here. We're recognizing that there's a lot of activity there, and we're obviously watching the macro environment carefully as well. No reason to believe that we won't see it kind of go back to what we were expecting for the year. If it continues to run higher, I think we'll enjoy that.\nI think we'll be positioned to do that with where our inventory sits today, but we're not banking on it. We want to make sure that we're approaching the rest of the year as we thought, adjusted for the pricing environment that we've seen in the first quarter.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. As it relates to the footprint and the fact that we do have vehicles coming from outside, we do build a significant amount of vehicles here. I think we also get fixated on where final assembly is versus all the powertrain plants that we have here, the stamping plants, the fact that we've invested in two battery plants, and that's what allows us to have such high USMCA compliant parts, some of those being our parts that we put into the vehicles from an assembly perspective. As we look at the broader portfolio, as you know, there's trade discussions going on with very important trading partners. We're going to monitor how those situations go. We have excess capacity in the US with the plants that we already have.\nThat allows us, if we want to make adjustments, we can do it faster than a greenfield and we can. Leverage the assets that we already have. That gives us speed and it makes it at lower cost. There's a lot of levers that we can pull. You've seen us do one already with the full size truck. We'll be announcing more as we go forward.\nI'm not sharing any more specific details today, but we'll adjust. Our commitment to our investors and our owners is that we're going to be smart in the way we deploy capital to respond to a different and changing environment.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, thank you. As a follow-up and maybe just touching on that, Mary, you know, I see that the CapEx outlook is unchanged, and I think many of us have interpreted the policy changes as a way to drive sort of increased final assembly in the country, which would then require you to move a fair amount of your footprint. Maybe you can just address A, why the near-term CapEx outlook is unchanged or you're just waiting for more certainty on policy, and B, if you are to start moving final assembly to the US, how should we think about the timing of those moves, what's easier, what's harder, and what the cost is?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Hey, Dan, I'll take a shot at that. Look, we've been pretty clear about how we're looking at capital, and we've determined $10 to 11 billion is the right amount to spend. Obviously, things happen that change priorities, and we have to meet and respond to that. I think we're going to continue to do that, and I think we'll endeavor to keep it in that range across the board. You're right in your observation that every decision on production and capacity is an independent one.\nThey all have different variables, and we've got to work through that. We will prioritize and optimize based on what gives us the biggest return going forward, and what's the right timing based on our product cycles and where we are in production, et cetera, to be able to make those calls. We'll manage capital responsibly.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Just to add what Paul said, agree 100%. We already have run. We were running many different scenarios that started last year. We have several things that are underway. We're just not going to announce them today because there's more work to do as we balance all of that. Again, we're going to be responsible with our capital.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ward with Citi Research. Your line is open.\n\nMike Ward\n\nAnalyst, Citi Research\n\nThanks very much. Good morning, everyone.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nMorning.\n\nMike Ward\n\nAnalyst, Citi Research\n\nWe've certainly beaten the negative aspects of the tariff situation all over the media and everywhere else. I'm just wondering what would be the best case scenario for you if something came out like if USMCA is renegotiating a year early, what impact does that have on you?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, it's hard to say, not knowing what will be done. We have no control over when USMCA is renegotiated. What I can tell you is when it was renegotiated during President Trump's first term, again, the administration worked to really understand our industry. As they increase the requirements from a USMCA or from NAFTA to USMCA, we work quickly and comply with that. I think a lot of the things that we've already done with the high level of US content and the work, as I already mentioned, that we've done to get our supply chain to be more resilient and be more buy where we build.\nI think we're going to be well situated, but we're going to continue to drive that up. I'm sure we'll have a voice into the negotiations when they happen. We'll manage it just like we did last time, and very proud of the fact that all of our vehicles built in North America are USMCA compliant, and the parts that we put into our vehicles in the US are more than 80% USMCA compliant.\n\nMike Ward\n\nAnalyst, Citi Research\n\nThe second thing is one of the areas that's been surprisingly on the positive side of the last four or five years has been cash generation at General Motors. What are some of the things you've done that have stepped up your ability to generate cash? And, I know you pulled forward the share repurchase into the first quarter, but what would it take to basically put that back on from a market standpoint?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nHey, Mike. Good morning and congratulations on your new shingle that you hung. I'm actually incredibly proud of the team on cash generation. I think number one, it starts with the vehicle portfolio. When you look at the quality and the demand that we've had for our vehicles over the last few years as we refresh that fleet, it really is a strong anchor for great financial performance. I think we've done a lot in terms of our go to market strategy, approaching it with more discipline in production, inventory management, as well as making sure that we were pricing our products appropriately and not necessarily over indexing into incentives.\nI think the entire commercial team deserves a lot of credit for that. In terms of really improving the margin performance and underlying operating cash flow of the business, then when you combine that with. I know we've been criticized in the past for capital expenditures, but if you look at our capital expenditures today, they're roughly approximate to where they were in 2017, 2018, after adjusting for the inflationary pressures that we've seen over the last few years. I think that disciplined CapEx on top of the really strong operating performance from the vehicle portfolio is really the secret and we've got to continue to harness that. As far as the share repurchase.\nThe banks, the counterparties that were in the ASR that we did in February are still in the market, and that transaction will settle. It gives us a little bit of time to evaluate the macro environment and kind of where we are, where we were, and where we sit. What I would say is that, you know, the actions taken by the President this week do a lot to sort of resolve the uncertainty of the tariff environment. We're making good progress in terms of figuring out where we sit. I think the guidance that we put in out today is evidence of that.\n\nMike Ward\n\nAnalyst, Citi Research\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, Mary and Paul. A question on Super Cruise: you mentioned in the deck you increased the population by 230,000 units year-on-year. Can you confirm how many are on the road right now collecting data in total, and curious, anything you wanted to highlight there in terms of rate of change on Super Cruise?\nIt seems like the Waymo Toyota collaboration on autonomous solutions and data collection is frankly in part a validation of your thesis and approach. I have a follow-up question. Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors",
    "content2": "Okay, just, you know, you're correct in that we added the 230,000 units. Let us see if we can quickly get what's that takes the total volume up to. As we said, we're committed to doubling that this year, and we're on track because we had 100% year-over-year from a Super Cruise perspective. Yes, appreciate your comments. Again, personal autonomy we think is so important as we move forward. That's why it was so important to get the team really focused on what it takes to lead from a personal autonomy perspective.\nThe team is doing that. We have many new members of the team, and now that we're on the GM side and now when you combine them with the Cruise team, I'm very excited about the progress. In fact, I'm going to be out there next week to do a deep dive in that review, and they're telling me by the calendar year end we'll have over 700,000 vehicles that are Super Cruise equipped. One of my regrets there, Adam, is that during the semiconductor shortage we had a choice of build without Super Cruise, not build. We're catching up quickly from that right now. That's why you see the growth this year.\nWe're committed to autonomy and continuing to improve with what we can do year by year. Again we'll hear more about that later in this year. The team is working really well.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Mary. Yeah, when I got my Tahoe, which I absolutely adore, unfortunately Super Cruise is not available at that time. Look, I like my Tesla, but for the record, I love my Tahoe. A follow up question, Mary.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nHey Adam, you know we have Super Cruise equipped Tahoes right now. Happy to introduce you to a dealer who could sell one to you if you'd like.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI don't. The Nero Shell people are great. We'll get talking to them.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nOkay.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nNext, my follow up. How do the tariff changes? Coupled with the advancements in AI and robotics, impact GM's approach to automation? Many of your global competitors such as Tesla, BYD, Xiaomi, Huawei, even Hyundai, Kia, et cetera, they're looking at things like humanoid robotics. As you work with NVIDIA and following the hiring of Barak Trosky, your new head of AI, is GM exploring humanoids in terms of either labor substitution or even making these robots and developing the given your expertise in complex supply chain and scale manufacturing at quality or any other form factors or comments on automation you'd like to share. Thanks, Mary.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, I think we're looking at efficiency and great efficiency all the way to the plant floor. Starts with smart design of the vehicles and then how you design the vehicles and how they can be put together very efficiently and good for the workforce. We focused a lot already and had tremendous expertise within the company of using automation, robots, cobots to really focus on the difficult to do jobs of putting a vehicle together. When they're difficult to do, you generally then get quality issues and you cause ergonomic issues. We are going to continue on smart design starting with the way the vehicles are built, built all the way through to the factory floor.\nWe do have extensive knowledge and work going on and several partnerships as we look at what is the latest technology to make sure we're efficient, we compete, and protect our workforce from a safety perspective. The answer is yes on all of those fronts. I did really want to reinforce it starts with designing the product well so it's easy to build, and therefore then you can leverage automation where it makes the most sense.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Mary.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Röska with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nDaniel Röska\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nGood morning, Mary, Paul. Thanks for taking the question. May I invite you to take a longer term view? With tariffs in place, the cost curve for parts is now higher, and the demand for parts of the US and USMCA compliant will be higher too. In your mind, as you're preparing for your next round of supplier discussions, what would prevent suppliers from raising prices on US and USMCA parts to capture some incremental margin here as long as the tariffs are in place?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, Daniel, we have worked hard over the last decade to have a very positive relationship with our suppliers and not make it transactional of sharing the pie of who gets more of the pie versus how do we take cost outs, drive more efficiency, leverage the good ideas that they have, and incorporate that into our vehicles faster. Frankly I would be disappointed if suppliers, especially with USMCA compliant, they're going to try to leverage this as a margin expansion, and frankly I don't think our suppliers will. We work regularly. There is going to be some pressure on our supply base. Again, and as we approach it, we always look for how do we together look at making the business more efficient.\nLess than a month ago, we had our supplier of the year, where we had our top suppliers together. We had conversations and breakouts about how do we work on this together. That's the way we're going to focus on this, not only this year, but into the indefinite future.\n\nDaniel Röska\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nThanks. Maybe as a follow-up, is there risk that there may be suppliers in your network were not able to completely document the USMCA compliance in the upcoming months, and kind of do you expect kind of the parts cost to be a little bit higher in the initial phase as suppliers kind of document the USMCA compliance and you then get to exclude those parts?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, we're working to help them do that because it's in both of our best interests. Again, we have supplier challenges day in and day out every year. We actually have a special team. We work with the suppliers that are struggling, and we're going to be very thoughtful about how we do that and continue to leverage the goodwill we have with suppliers that we earned during COVID, during the semiconductor shortage, and as we move forward. So, you know, I'm not going to comment on, you know, is there going to be zero, but again, we're going to be very thoughtful and first look to see how do we offset and how do we work together to make it more efficient.\nWe've been actually doing some great work with the supply base of really encouraging and getting them involved earlier in our vehicle design so we can take advantage of their best ideas. And that's where you really get the savings versus if you're talking about looking at it at the end, you're not driving the efficiency that you need to have. We're very much bringing them further left in our development process so we can both win together. And when we have great vehicles that sell well in the marketplace like you're seeing right now, that's best for our suppliers too.\n\nDaniel Röska\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nMakes sense. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask maybe a positive question on tariffs. Mary, as you think about your product cadence going forward and the products you're going after, I'm just curious if there's been any significant changes because as we look at this, the German luxury brands are widely disadvantaged and so are really the Koreans sort of in the mid level of the market. It seems like there may be a real opportunity for Cadillac and Chevrolet to really kind of lean into this and not just maybe take price, but really take market share.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nJohn, I think first of all, thanks for the question. I think you bring up a very good point. We do build, you know, what is it over 1.5 million units in this country. Some of our most important where we lead in market share and we're growing share already with the newly redesigned full size SUVs that are built in Texas, we saw 30% growth and the Escalade as well with both the Escalade and the Escalade IQ built in Texas and Michigan. There is huge opportunity for us to continue to build and leverage our product strength and the fact that these vehicles are built in the US and have the USMCA compliant.\nIn fact, what we've just seen is the best April since 2007. I think there is upside opportunity for General Motors in both ICE and EV. Believe me, we're going to leverage every single opportunity.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd then maybe if I could sneak one last one in on the tariff side from the other side of the equation, you guys are operating incredibly well in a very tough environment. $10 to 12 billion of $12.5 billion on EBIT should be commended. You put a floor of $8 a share out there, you're raising the dividends, you're moving some manufacturing back to the US from the administration's perspective, as they look at this, you're a success story. You're certainly not a company in trouble by any stretch of the imagination. You're succeeding in a tough environment as you're talking to them and working on maybe some further relief from tariffs.\nI mean, what kind of leverage or angle are you using with them? Because the reality is given the current state of affairs, you're still doing fairly well. I'm just curious, as you have these discussions and maybe hope for relief or push for relief. How do you kind of position yourselves in that discussion?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, I think one is we're committed to the United States. As I said in my opening remarks, we have more employees in this country than anyone else. We provide over 45,000 and growing good paying jobs from a represented perspective that really the industry created the middle class and will continue to do that. I think that, when we look at everything that's going on, and I think you brought a lot of really good points, we want to be in a position where we're 100% goal aligned with the President, is to have a strong US auto industry. We have made points of what it takes for us to do that and grow share, and then have a level playing field so we can grow from an export perspective.\nWhat we're going to do is continue to leverage the strong product portfolio that we have. We've made the point we need to generate enough that we can reinvest in the business to continue to have strong product programs. We're just going to continue to keep, keep executing. We have never approached this situation because we understood from the early discussions I had directly with the President that he had a very strong goal to strengthen manufacturing in this country. We want to be a part of it. We haven't thought of this as a chaotic environment.\nWe've looked at it as okay; we complied with USMCA when it was done in his first term. We were able to make that point and show that strongly. That's what we're doing. We talked about the opportunities that make good business sense for us to make some changes to our footprint based on the new environment. I'd say the conversation has been very productive.\nI do want to thank the President and the administration for taking the time, investing their time to understand our industry so we can accomplish our shared goals of growing the US auto industry, which will be good for America in the long term. Lastly, I'll just say when you think about our industry, it's not only important from an economic security perspective, it's important from a national security perspective. We've had those conversations as well. Thank you, John, for both of your questions.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, I really appreciate first of all everybody's flexibility as, again, I want to reiterate, we changed this call because we really wanted to provide the best guidance that we could. We had a good sense that after the actions taken by the administration were announced, we would be able to share with you our guidance for the year, which is exactly what we did. We're going to continue to work to strengthen our business. I think you've got a leadership team that is committed to being agile and flexible, focusing on what's important in this industry, and that's having strong product. Because at the end of the day, the product is what gets you more customers, earns you more share.\nMakes your position with the supply base very strong, and continue to build on the loyalty that we have in the United States. We look forward to continuing to grow this business we've grown for the last three years, and continuing to deliver returns to our shareholders. That's what we're focused on. We will continue to be good stewards of you, our owner's, capital, and we appreciate your interest today and your support. So thank you all very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining."

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We are asking analysts to limit their questions to one, and a brief follow-up. To ask a question, press star then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star then two. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, 28 January 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Motors\n\nThanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the Q4 and calendar year 2024.\nOur conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO, and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning.\nI'd like to begin by thanking our employees, dealers, and suppliers for helping us deliver another outstanding year. A year ago on this call, I said that we were optimistic about 2024 given the choice we would offer customers, including industry-leading full-size pickups, new and redesigned SUVs, and an expanding portfolio of EVs. I stressed that we would be focused on execution and profitability. I'm proud to say that our full-year revenue grew by 9% last year. We were number one in the US in retail, fleet, and total sales. We grew our market share, and we distanced ourselves from the industry's pricing incentives and inventory pressures. In our growing EV business, we produced and wholesaled 189,000 vehicles in North America. We doubled our market share over the course of the year as we scaled production, and our portfolio became variable profit positive in Q4.\nThis combination of compelling vehicles in high-volume and growing segments, strong execution, and discipline led to record EBIT-adjusted, record adjusted automotive free cash flow, and record EPS diluted-adjusted. At the same time, we continued to allocate capital consistently and in a balanced manner. We invested to drive the business forward, and we improved our balance sheet. Our employees and owners are all sharing in our success. I'm pleased to share that our global salary team earned strong performance bonuses, and our US hourly employees once again earned the industry's highest profit sharing, totaling more than $640 million. That's a record payout of up to $14,500 per person, equal to more than two months of extra pay for average UAW-represented team member.\nInvestors in GM also earned a 50% total return, and we ended the year with fewer than $1 billion shares outstanding, a goal we reached ahead of plan. Throughout the year, we also addressed challenges with resolve. In China, we have been working with our JV partners to drive better performance in the market by right-sizing the businesses, launching new products, reducing dealer inventory, and building to demand. We are making good progress and reported positive equity income for Q4 before restructuring costs. To improve year-over-year results and make SGM sustainably profitable, they will be implementing a wide range of restructuring initiatives this year that include reducing capacity to operate within utilization levels of about 80% or better. We are in the process of finalizing details with our partner. Importantly, we believe SGM has the resources to complete its restructuring without additional capital from GM.\nAs you know, we also stopped funding robotaxi development at Cruise. We have a proposed restructuring plan that will refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles. We expect to see a run-rate savings of about $1 billion on an annualized basis by ending robotaxi development, and we look forward to acquiring the small number of Cruise shares we don't own and finalizing the restructuring plan later this quarter. The momentum we have in both ICE vehicles and EVs will drive our results once again in 2025. For example, the redesigned Chevrolet and GMC full-size SUVs that we launched late last year are supporting even stronger ATPs than the outgoing models thanks to their refined exteriors, all-new interiors, and new models like our GMC Yukon AT4 Ultimate.\nWe also have a full year of our new compact and midsize ICE SUVs, which include some of our highest volume nameplates like the Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Traverse, and GMC Acadia. They are great examples of our strategy to pair bold designs to drive higher ATPs with discipline and capital efficiency to drive better profitability. As Mark shared at Investor Day, we're seeing EBIT improvements in the 10 percentage point range on some of these vehicles. Cadillac is also very well positioned. Last year, Cadillac had its best full-year sales since 2016 thanks to the ongoing success of the Escalade with its refined exterior and stunning new interior, our high-performance V-Series and Blackwing models, and the LYRIQ, which is now the country's best-selling midsize luxury electric SUV according to S&P Global Mobility.\nThis year, we expect the ESCALADE IQ, OPTIQ, and VISTIQ to further grow GM's share of the luxury EV market. EV adoption has been higher in luxury segments. We are being guided by the customer and will continue to be. These new Cadillacs stand out with their beautiful designs, advanced technology, and customer-focused innovation. Here are just a few examples. The OPTIQ, which is scaling now, and the seven-passenger VISTIQ, which launches in the spring, will be the first Cadillacs to offer AKG Audio Systems with Dolby Atmos that reveal more depth, detail, and clarity in the customer's favorite music. All Cadillac EVs now come equipped with vehicle-to-home capability, allowing them to power a home during outages using a GM Energy PowerShift charger and our vehicle-to-home equipment package.\nWith the VISTIQ, Cadillac will be the first GM brand to roll out a new ADAS feature that builds on adaptive cruise control and lane centering. The new feature allows an attentive driver to engage the system and travel on millions of miles of roads with a light hand on the wheel. There's the Cadillac ESCALADE IQ. With its presence, range, performance, comfort, and technology, it's really in a class of its own. One of our New York area Cadillac dealers, who has decades of experience with other luxury franchises, says it's the most impressive vehicle he has ever driven. Customers are noticing. Since production began late last year, we've sold more than 1,500 ESCALADE IQs. 2025 will also be a year of rapid growth for Super Cruise across all of our brands.\nOur customer-focused strategy with Super Cruise is to continuously refine and expand its capabilities to make it indispensable. This is how we are setting the stage for recurring high-margin revenue streams from subscriptions. Since we launched Super Cruise, we have added hundreds of thousands of miles of new roads to its network and introduced features like automatic lane change and hands-free towing. This has helped make about 60% of our roughly 360,000 Super Cruise customers regular users. This year, we expect our Super Cruise equipped fleet to roughly double in size. Subscription revenue is becoming an increasingly important part of the Super Cruise opportunity now that our first customers have completed their three-year trial. Last year, we saw subscription attach rates of about 20% off of a base of roughly 18,000 vehicles.\nThis year, an additional 33,000 vehicles will end their trial periods, and we target to more than double subscription revenue. Within five years, we expect to approach about $2 billion in total annual revenue from Super Cruise. These are just a few of the many exciting opportunities ahead of us, and we look forward to sharing more details with you as we go forward. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to mention the projects we're pursuing with Hyundai. As Hyundai has shared, our teams are moving quickly to finalize the first of several product and purchasing agreements that are designed to help us move faster, lower cost, and become more capital efficient. The collaborations will be global in nature, targeting specific segments and areas of the business, and we'll be sharing more details very soon.\nI would also like to address the uncertainty around public policy, trade, and regulation. It remains to be seen how things will evolve. So our 2025 guidance, Paul will share in his remarks, does not take into account future policy changes. We have been both proactive with Congress and the administration, and in our conversations, we have stressed the importance of a strong manufacturing sector and American leadership in advanced technologies. It's clear that we share a lot of common ground, and we have appreciated the dialogue. We believe the President wants to use policy and regulations in ways that will strengthen, not harm, domestic manufacturers like GM. We look forward to continuing to work with the President and his team as they consider how to strike the right balance on these important issues.\nWith respect to possible tariffs, we are working across our supply chain, logistics network, and assembly plants so that we are prepared to mitigate near-term impacts. Many of these actions are no-cost or low-cost. What we won't do is spend a large amount of capital without clarity. Whatever happens on these fronts, we have a very broad and deep portfolio of ICE vehicles and EVs that are both growing market share, and we'll be agile and execute as efficiently as possible. With that, I'd like to invite Paul to walk you through our results and 2025 financial guidance, and then we'll move to Q&A. Thank you.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nThank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning as we summarize another year of strong financial results for GM.\nOur full-year EBIT-adjusted of $14.9 billion was at the high end of the range we guided to in October, driven by a particularly strong November and December. This resulted in $10.60 of EPS diluted-adjusted, up 38% year-over-year, and partially aided by a significantly lower share count as we continued to return excess capital to shareholders. We increased our full-year revenue by 9% to $187 billion, with a 6% rise in wholesale volumes and ATPs above $50,000. Throughout the year, our incentives as a percentage of ATP steadily improved, starting the Q1 nearly one percentage point below the industry average and ending the year at the lowest incentive levels in the industry and more than three points below average. Our strategy of disciplined pricing and incentives continues to separate us from most of our peers. And at the same time, we are growing market share. Our US\nMarket share for the full year was up 30 basis points to 16.5%, and we ended the year on a positive note at 17.5% in the Q4, the highest since the Q4 of 2018, excluding the impacts of the pandemic in 2020. Our performance was fueled by strong EV growth and a refreshed ICE portfolio. ICE dealer inventory ended at 53 days at the low end of our 50 to 60-day year-end target, driven by strong sales and appropriately balancing our production to demand. We are also making significant progress on EVs. In 2024, we wholesaled 189,000 EVs and delivered more than 146,000 units. Recall at the end of the Q3, we had around 100 days of EV dealer inventory so that customers would have the opportunity to see and experience our products.\nThis strategy paid off, and we successfully reduced this to 70 days by year-end as our EV deliveries rose. As Mary highlighted, a big focus of the company has been improving EV profitability. We achieved variable profit positive on our EVs in Q4 through continued manufacturing scale and efficiencies from higher production, improved material costs, including lower cell costs from scale and performance, and expansion of our EV portfolio with the launch of the Cadillac ESCALADE IQ and Sierra EV. There's more work to achieve our goal of a positive EBIT margin, but we believe we're making good progress. For instance, the Equinox EV has seen a $1,000 improvement in variable profit since its launch in just Q2 of last year. Next, I'd like to discuss capital allocation.\nWe continue to balance three key elements: investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning excess capital to our shareholders. First, we believe that the amount of capital we are investing back into the business is appropriate to efficiently support long-term profitable growth. Our forecasted capital spend in 2025, including battery JV investments, remains similar year-over-year at $10 to 11 billion. Second, we paid off $750 million of senior notes in the Q4 ahead of their maturity in 2025. We have another $1.75 billion maturing later this year. We will assess refinancing opportunities or debt extinguishment as we progress throughout the year. Third, we returned a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders during 2024. We generated full-year adjusted auto free cash flow of $14 billion and returned nearly 55% of this free cash flow, or approximately $7.6 billion.\nIn the Q4, we completed the ASR, retiring an additional 25 million shares. We also repurchased 87 million shares in the open market during the quarter at an average price of $53.84 a share. This resulted in us ending the year with an outstanding share count of 995 million, achieving our goal from early last year to reduce our share count below 1 billion shares earlier than scheduled. On a diluted basis, this represents 1.02 billion shares, a decrease of 28% since the end of 2022 and a decrease of 12% compared to the end of 2023. Moving forward, we expect to continue returning excess capital to our shareholders and further reducing the share count. Getting into the Q4 results, total company revenue was $48 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by higher wholesales and consistent pricing.\nWe achieved $2.5 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 5.3% EBIT-adjusted margins, and $1.92 in EPS diluted-adjusted. We completed the net $2 billion fixed cost reduction program. Compared to the end of 2022, we realized $900 million in lower marketing spend and $700 million in lower automotive engineering costs. The remainder was realized through rationalization across some of our earlier stage initiatives, which was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization. A quick update on our EV inventory valuation allowances. We ended the year with a balance of $1.4 billion, which includes a small reduction in the Q4. We expect further reductions as we move through 2025, but the pace and magnitude will be dependent on EV demand. We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.8 billion during the Q4, up $500 million year-over-year, primarily driven by EBIT performance.\nNorth America delivered Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion, up $300 million year-over-year. We benefited from the absence of 2023's Q4 strike and inventory adjustments. Additionally, the fixed cost program contributed to offsetting higher labor and warranty costs. While we remained disciplined on pricing, we faced a slight headwind from full-size truck incentives. I want to take a moment to emphasize the strong full-year North American margin of 9.2%, well within our targeted 8% to 10 range. We are executing well on our product launches, along with being disciplined on costs, pricing, and inventory levels. Our broad and refreshed product portfolio is a key factor driving these strong results. In the Q4, we achieved a margin of 5.8%. This included certain discrete items, including breach of warranty and legal reserves, which roughly impacted margin by 1.3 percentage points.\nI'd now like to discuss the continued higher warranty costs, which include the initial product warranty accrual, recall campaigns, and breach of warranty exposure. Despite our success, we know we have an opportunity to improve our results by aggressively targeting our warranty expense. The first priority is always our customers, focusing on parts availability. At the same time, the team is actively working to tackle the root cause of issues as they arise. Our commitment starts with the initial quality of our products, an area where we are a leader in the industry. We've achieved a significant reduction in claims with a decrease in the US of over 30% since 2018. However, this benefit has been more than offset by a 100% increase in the cost of repair, driven by both parts and labor inflation over the same period.\nRest assured, we remain committed to finding ways to mitigate inflationary pressures and navigate the strict regulatory and legal landscape. We are optimistic that our intense focus on driving down repair costs and improving quality will reduce our warranty costs over time. GM International delivered Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $200 million, driven by strong execution and tight cost controls in South America and the Middle East, along with positive China equity income of $17 million, excluding the restructuring charge. The team in China has done a great job of reducing inventory, with SGM's inventories down over 60% from the end of 2023. They have implemented effective cost reductions and have been focusing on enhancing product competitiveness, which helped Q4 sales increase 40% sequentially versus the Q3. We recorded a $4.1 billion special item in our auto China equity income.\nApproximately half of this related to an impairment, while the rest is connected to various restructuring actions we have taken so far in China. It's important to note that these charges are not expected to require any capital from GM, as the joint venture has sufficient cash to cover these costs. We believe these actions, along with a comprehensive product launch plan in 2025 that ensures at least one NEV option per product program, will help us achieve our target of the China business returning to profitability in 2025. GM Financial also had a strong year of profitability and capital return to GM. Q4 EBIT-adjusted was consistent year-over-year at $700 million. Higher net financing revenue offset lower lease termination gains and higher provision expense driven by increased loan origination volume.\nGM Financial's full-year EBIT-adjusted was $3.0 billion at the top of their guidance range, and they paid dividends of $1.8 billion to GM. Cruise expenses, excluding the special items for the restructuring charge, were $400 million in the quarter, down from $800 million in 2023. As Mary said, we believe our refocused autonomous driving strategy will lead to efficiencies and a $1 billion annual run rate savings in our investment relative to the $1.7 billion we spent on Cruise in 2024. These decisions led to a $500 million restructuring charge in the Q4, which was classified as a special item, with approximately two-thirds being cash-based. Additionally, later this year, we plan to include the expenditures for the Cruise employees in our North America segment. This will impact our North America margin by around 50 basis points this year.\nHowever, we still expect to remain within our 8% to 10 range. It will also increase our auto fixed costs and reduce our adjusted automotive cash flow as the cash used by Cruise was excluded previously. Moving to our 2025 guidance, we expect EBIT-adjusted in the $13.7 to 15.7 billion range, EPS diluted-adjusted to be in the $11 to 12 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $11 to 13 billion range. It's important to note that our guidance does not account for the impact of future policy changes by the new administration, including tariffs, tax reform, or other regulation changes. We do anticipate some headwinds in both volume and mix, stemming from a modest decline in ICE wholesale volume in North America as we appropriately balance dealer inventory levels. However, this will be partially offset by higher EV volume.\nWe're optimistic in our robust product portfolio and our ability to drive market share expansion through strong ICE sales, complemented by a strategically diverse lineup of EVs. Additionally, we are planning for a similar US industry year-over-year to 2024. In terms of pricing, we're assuming a decline in North America of 1% to 1.5 year-over-year to capture potentially higher incentives or a moderation in ATPs. While we are not seeing this at the moment, we believe it's a prudent way to plan our budget as we have in years past. Offsetting these headwinds, we anticipate EV profitability improvements at the low end of our $2 to 4 billion EBIT year-over-year target. This improvement is based on wholesales of around 300,000 units and is predicted to come from scale, fixed cost absorption, and a continued focus on sell and vehicle cost reductions.\nRegarding Cruise, our guidance includes around $500 million of the $1 billion annual savings we previously discussed. This is based on our assumption that Cruise employees will be fully integrated into GM by mid-year. We anticipate other costs outside of Cruise and the EV profitability improvements to be favorable. This is mainly due to variable costs such as commodities and logistics, which are expected to more than offset headwinds from depreciation, amortization, and higher labor costs. For GM International, we expect a tailwind from restructuring the China business and are targeting profitable equity income for the full year. GM International outside of China should be similar to what was delivered in 2024. For GM Financial, we expect EBIT-adjusted to be in the $2.5 to 3 billion range, reflecting the targeted return for the credit risk profile and asset mix in a largely stable economic environment.\nWe expect an increase in earning assets driven by both loan and lease portfolios. We are forecasting another year of robust adjusted automotive free cash flow. However, we anticipate year-over-year headwinds in the range of $1 to 3 billion from the non-repeat of working capital benefits realized in 2024, primarily from dealer inventory restocking, the timing of payments for previously accrued liabilities, notably warranty, and the inclusion of Cruise spend. Capital spending is expected to be similar year-over-year and in the $10 to 11 billion range, including battery JV investments. We continue to strategically spend on our ICE portfolio and build flexibility into our manufacturing capabilities to maintain agility to adapt to consumer preferences between ICE and EV powertrains. Our full-year EPS guidance assumes weighted average diluted share count of approximately one billion shares, which excludes the impact of any future open market purchases.\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to every GM team member. Their hard work and dedication have been pivotal in driving our strong financial performance in 2024. A relentless focus on execution, discipline, and adaptability has enabled us to successfully navigate a dynamic and challenging landscape, and we believe these key success factors are going to continue to support our efforts towards another promising year in 2025. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to analysts, we are asking that you limit your questions to one and a brief follow-up so that we may get to everyone on the call. To ask a question, press star then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star then two.\nOur first question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start with the question on the guidance and specifically if we could double-click on the volume assumptions. I know you're talking about headwinds, but I'm wondering if we could maybe get a sense of the magnitude. The third-party data forecasters have your North America production down 9% for 2025. I know a lot of that is just non-repeat of inventory build. Maybe you can just give us a sense of what type of SAAR and share assumptions you have. And then maybe you can just comment specifically on the share. It was really strong in the Q4. Is there any sustainability to that?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nSo, hey, Dan, thanks for the question. You were getting a little garbled at the end.\nI think bad cell connection, but I think you were asking about SAAR assumptions for 2025 and then the share uplift that we saw at the back half of the year, particularly in the Q4. How sustainable is that? So we're looking at 2025 on a SAAR basis to be fairly similar to '24 or to 2024. I think there's some speculation out there that we saw a big pull ahead in demand in the month of December, whether that was EV-driven or just consumer-driven ahead of inauguration. I think one of the things is we're adopting a little bit of a wait and see on that. January has been really noisy, as Mary had mentioned in comments this morning about both the weather, the fires in California, etc. So it's tough to glean whether there was a big pull forward.\nSo we've kind of projected demand to be pretty similar to last year. On the share side, I think, really proud of the team. They have done a tremendous job. And as we've said for a few years, as we have been able to ramp up EVs, we saw the opportunity to grow share in EVs, and ICE, and it was not mutually exclusive. And I think the team's been doing that. We are at a share level that we haven't seen if you exclude COVID since 2018. I think that's tremendous results. I think the team is not going to stop there, but we're going to continue to work towards that. Going forward, I think we were projecting an opportunity or some pretty big ICE impacts from not having as much restocking. I think we're going to kind of wait and see to where demand is.\nWe obviously do have an opportunity to build a little bit of inventory within the 50 to 60-day window that we've outlined at year-end as a result of that demand surge that we saw in Q4. But we're going to kind of watch that. But other than that, I think a pretty similar environment in 2025 than what we experienced in 2024.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. As a follow-up, a bit of a policy question. I know you're waiting to see how everything plays out, but President Trump has said he's reversing the EV mandate. I think we all expect some reversal in the tax credits, perhaps a change in EPA. In this environment, can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about resource allocation toward EVs? How much overhead spend can you pull back on? Just how the strategy shifts amid a potential change in EV policy?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, I think you've seen us over the last few years be very mindful of what consumer demand is for EVs and make decisions like we did with Orion and the third plant that we're in the process of selling our share to LG. So we're going to continue to make decisions like that to be appropriate with our capital as we look at how EVs are going to grow. We never expected it would be a straight line. We're also going to deploy capital appropriately to our ICE portfolio. I think we have the strongest portfolio General Motors has had in decades. Maybe I'm a little biased there, but I think we're seeing that with the response in the market as well. So we're going to continue to be very efficient as we deploy capital to both ICE and EV, again, guided by the consumer demand.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you very much. Good morning. My first question on this margin exit rate in 2024, with that sort of at the large LC and RV charges like you had last year or the strike and strong ATPs in the quarter, I think some investors may have expected a bit of a higher exit rate in terms of margin. I know you mentioned about 130 basis points of one-time type items. Can you just come back and comment on the quarter performance and, to what extent, I guess, what would the bridge look like towards 8% to 10 in 2025?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Good morning, Emmanuel. Not surprised about this question. We did say in the remarks that there were two specific issues really around warranty and policy.\nOne was a legal settlement on the oil consumption case, which we recorded in the Q4. That'll be in our 10-K. And then the second is we've continued to see some breach of warranty pressure, as we talked about in the regulatory and legal environment. We're trying to get a little bit ahead of that just based on the trends that we see. Those two items in and of themselves were a little bit more than a point, as we talked about. That kind of puts us in line with normal seasonality. I'd also point out, remember that we had, I think we disclosed about $300 million in Q3 that was a pull forward of vehicles that were expected to deliver in the Q4. That benefited September and Q3 at the expense of Q4. And then lastly, normal seasonality.\nWe've got 11 fewer production days just generally based on the holiday schedule. Remember, we lost a couple of days at Arlington because of the floods in North Carolina, and the tragedy that impacted that community, and a supplier that we had there. So I'm not overly worked up about it. I think when you look at some of those one-off events, I think we're pretty good. The one thing I do want to say, because I know we've received some inbound questions, EV mix wasn't really a meaningful factor in that Q4. It does have a downward impact, but it was really outweighed significantly by those pressures that I just highlighted. So that hopefully gives a little bit more confidence in the construct going forward for 2025.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nI appreciate that, caller. Second question is around capital allocation. So it was good to hear you restate the capital allocation policy.\nIt seems like based on the guidance, CapEx, and sort of other actions, it would leave again some considerable amount of capital to return to shareholders. I think you're probably through most of your existing authorizations for buyback. So what would be the next step here?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, Emmanuel, thanks for the question. We're really proud of the strong free cash flow generation that we had in 2024, and we expect another year of very strong free cash flow. And we're going to continue to follow our capital allocation policy. So we'll be working with the board on the next phase, and we'll provide updates as we move forward. But you can look to us following the capital allocation framework as we've done this year, or I should say done in 2024.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYes. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joe Spak with UBS.\nYour line is open.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just one quick one on the quarter and then a bigger picture one. GM&A pricing in the quarter, I think when you showed some of the pricing data and the sales release, it looked like things were really strong, accelerating through the quarter. Incentives were low. Yet in the factor, it was still a slight year-over-year headwind. Was there any incentive accrual or anything in the quarter that weighed on that? And maybe related to pricing also, the 1% to 1.5 for 2025, does that include? Is that overall including the EV portfolio, and do you expect some pricing on pressure on EVs?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Hey, Joe. Thanks for the question. What I would say is there is a little bit of noise in the sort of year-over-year interplay in the accrual on the inventory for incentives.\nBut commercially, I think everything that you mentioned is right. It was a strong year for pricing across the board, and strong demand in the Q4, and we expect that to continue going forward in pricing. For the 1 to 1.5, you'll notice that that's down a little bit from the way we've haircut in prior years. I think that's a statement that we expect a little bit more stability as our competitors have worked down some of their higher inventory balances. So we expect a year of a little bit more stability. The down 1 to 1.5, I would remind you, is just kind of the way we look at a planning assumption.\nIt's not necessarily in our expectations, but it's how we run the business and how we guide the business going forward so that we can adjust if we see that, but not necessarily an indication of the commercial market. Like I said, January, the pricing has been good. In fact, I think ATPs were up a little bit. Incentives were down a little bit. But there's just so much noise in it. We're being cautious until we get a little bit more smooth data from the marketplace just because January was so noisy.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nOkay. And just going back to policy, and I know you're not going to do anything without prudence or you're going to take some careful evaluation and have profitability and capital efficiency in mind. I just was wondering if you could spend a minute talking about the flexibility you have in your footprint.\nI mean, we know about the ICE, EV flexibility because you showed us that in Tennessee, but I'm curious a little bit more about just shifting mix of production between plants, especially on the full-size vehicles, which are produced across North America, if there are any sort of near-term actions on tariffs, etc.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, Joe, it's a good question. And we've been studying multiple scenarios. But from a Mexico perspective, we do build trucks in Mexico, in Canada, and in the United States. And so we have the capacity in the United States to shift some of that. We also sell trucks globally, and so we can look at where the international markets are being sourced from. So there's plays that we can do on that perspective to minimize the impact if there are tariffs either on Canada or Mexico.\nWe're encouraged that President Sheinbaum of Mexico has indicated that they are working and having conversations to take the steps necessary that the Trump administration is looking for, specifically around immigration and some other things to avoid the tariffs. But we're doing the planning and have several levers that we can pull.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, everybody. Sorry to stay on the mundane topic of policy, but just trying to understand the baseline of where you're starting, where you're assuming policy doesn't change. I mean, Trump, through the Unleashing American Energy Executive Order, essentially canceled CARB's waiver so they can't execute on the ACC II.\nWas your understanding that you do not have to comply with CARB's ACC II and get to 35% of your volume as EVs in California and the other states? I mean, just what is your interpretation there and how are you going to operate going forward? Because obviously, that ratchets up to 45% next year and then 100% by 2035.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Our message to President Trump and the administration is that as EV requirements are changed, we've got to make sure that the stringency is as well. Frankly, even in today's environment, before anything changes, what's happening from a CARB perspective across multiple states is just not where the customer's at. And we've been engaging at the state level. Our dealers have been engaging at the state level. And so there's a tremendous amount of work going on in that.\nAs it relates to what specifically has happened through executive order, I think there's still some more policy work that needs to be done so we can comply and make sure we're not in a penalty situation, which we're watching carefully. But don't disagree with you that I think there's directional change coming. It's not completely done yet, but we're watching and providing our input at the state level, and the federal level.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nBut your understanding, Mary, is right now that the 35% requirement that would have been put in place is actually not in place at the moment, right, because of that Executive Order. Is that how you guys are operating? I just want to make sure I understand that.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Actually, no, because I think there's legislative or legal changes or policy by different organizations that have to align with that.\nWe're very clear on the direction, but I don't think we can, as an auto manufacturer right now, can assume that that is gone at this precise moment.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Very uncertain. Just one last one, Mary, quickly on the AV commitment. Obviously, there's a lot of costs that are being ported across from Cruise into the company. So you're getting some good savings, but you're still spending a lot of money on ADAS and level three to ultimately level four and five autonomy. Are you still have an internal commitment to developing level four and five on your own as sort of a build, or is there the potential that you think you might need to go out and buy just given the way that you're going after this at the moment?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, John, it's a great question.\nI think even with what we saw yesterday, there is so much happening from an artificial intelligence perspective of how we move forward. We do and have built the capability inside General Motors. Obviously, our plan that we're working to execute with Cruise would strengthen that, much of what we can do. There may be strategic partners that we also work with on aspects of this. So we want to be leaders in level four autonomy. We think we're going to continue to evaluate the landscape to do that as capital efficiently as possible, but still maintain a leadership position and also a strong relationship with the customer because we think that this is game-changing for our industry.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Yeah.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto and Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nI just wanted to follow up on Murph's line of questioning around autonomy. I think you said you had 360,000 enabled vehicles with Super Cruise on the road, and you expect to double that in 2025, and that you're moving from a foundation or moving to a foundation and end-to-end approach, training your massive data sets. Can you tell us how moving to end-to-end might change your spending, how you approach compute costs? You alluded to, Mary, working with strategic partners. I think that resonates too. But maybe elaborate a little further on what that might mean to the bottom line or how you're allocating capital over the next 12 or 24 months. And also, I assume most of those 360,000 units are ICE vehicles.\nSo I'm wondering if in your answer you can include, is there any significance or difference, disadvantage, if you will, of collecting data from non-software-defined ICE vehicles versus your completely new architecture, kind of EV architecture vehicles for training? Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, just thanks, Adam. And from the last question, we can collect information. Of course, we're following all the appropriate policy guidelines and rules that we have within General Motors to make sure that we treat customers' data appropriately. But we can anonymize the data and leverage it to not only improve the performance, but to improve the safety. And we're really proud of where we are with Super Cruise, with our safety record, and the fact that we have some features like towing that no one else has. We're going to continue to build on those.\nI mentioned something that's coming as an improvement from a driver-assist technology yet this year. We're going to continue and think we can accelerate that if we are able to execute our plan to incorporate the great talent that we have at Cruise for getting Super Cruise to level three, level three plus, and beyond. When we talk about in our forecast, you asked for the next 12 to 18 months. I think what we shared of the savings that we'll see from not pursuing robotaxi, $1 billion on an annualized run rate, that kind of captures within the spend that we have is what we think we need to spend from a compute perspective as kind of part of the operating budget. So we're going to continue to evaluate it as we saw yesterday.\nAnd I mentioned that there's so much change that's happening in this space right now. Anything that we can do to be more efficient with the spend, of course, we're going to seize that opportunity. But we remain committed to autonomy because we do think it has such a dramatic impact from a customer experience perspective for the better and actually changes the margin profile of the business as well.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto and Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Mary. Just as a follow-up on China, despite recent challenges that you've addressed very proactively, GM does have decades of experience in the market, and you have many billions of invested capital, lots of people, and capacity still in place in IP with your JV partners. President Trump has been open to foreign firms participating in the US as long as they make products in America, if I'm paraphrasing accurately.\nDo you see scope for GM to help your existing or even new Chinese partners kind of gain access to the US using your existing onshore capacity and distribution capability? I want to see how you'd approach that, maybe if not so relevant in the next six or 12 months, but longer term, just given your decades of experience in that market and the relationships that you've built there. Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Adam, what I've always said broadly on trade across the board is give us a level playing field and let us compete and win based on the strength of our products, the technology, design, loyalty, etc. I think what's happening right now with the overcapacity in China and what's happening around the globe and the subsidies that are occurring, we're not any close to a level playing field. So I also think we have the opportunity.\nAs we mentioned last year, we grew both ICE and EV share. So I think we're doing a good job of leveraging our capacity that we have in North America. That's where we're going to stay focused because I think that's what's right for the long term of the industry. I think we all have to get focused on not only where's the vehicle final assembly, where's the supply chain coming from for all of the parts, including battery raw materials, but also where's the IP developed? Because understanding where that research and development is done, as I mentioned earlier today in some of my media spots, it's very important for automotive technology, not only for manufacturing in this country from an economic security perspective, but a lot of the technology as it relates to national security. So I think you have to factor all those issues in.\nBut right now, I'm focused on leveraging the capacity that we have with General Motors and our opportunities to grow.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto and Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Mary.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks so much, [inaudible]. Yep. Just the questions around, it seems, Paul, you made it clear that the guide for policy, particularly on the EV front, is sort of status quo. That's clear. Could you just go through then if production's still 300,000 units or wholesale's 300,000 units, what are the specific drivers to the low end of the range already, meaning $2 billion versus the $4 billion, assuming no change in policy?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. So when we talked about the journey towards profitability, we first highlighted that back in November of 2023.\nWe talked about scale being the most important driver in the short to medium term, and then battery cost improvements and other vehicle cost improvements starting to kick in after that. Since that disclosure, and certainly what we saw throughout 2024, where we were talking about 200 to 300,000 units and came in just a touch below 200,000, but still achieved our variable profit positive, the volume trajectory and the growth, and therefore the realization of the scale benefits is coming in a little bit slower and lagged in there. So with 300,000 units, we think that's a good trajectory based on what we've seen over the last particularly six months as we've picked up share in EVs, and the vehicle mix is continuing to get a little bit richer with the ESCALADE IQ, etc.\nWe think we can still deliver the low end of that $2 to 4 billion of savings improvement, even though it's on lower volume than where we thought we would be more than a year ago and certainly throughout last year. So going forward, we're going to continue to watch that. As many people have asked here on the call, what happens to consumer tax credits? What happens to IRA, etc.? There's a lot of moving parts out there. What I would say is whether we're talking about IRA or tariffs, we've got multiple playbooks that we have been working on to make sure that we can respond or even anticipate some of those moves. Some of those are very low cost, and we can be very flexible with them.\nSome of them are bigger deals and bigger transactions, like, as Mary mentioned, the transaction with LGES on Ultium Site 3. We've got ways to be able to respond to that. The reason that we guided to the status quo is because there are really infinite permutations on policy, and we didn't want to get into advocacy in our guidance. So this is why we've done it. But rest assured, we've got plans in place, and we're continuing to work proactively with the administration and with Congress on what we think are the right things to do, which is preserve American jobs and preserve American innovation. And I think we're a good actor in that space.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nSuper clear. And then just the follow-up is on the composition of 2025 wholesale growth. So it sounds like you're guiding wholesale slightly down. Obviously, EV wholesale up 100,000.\nYou didn't give a specific number, but you mentioned ICE down. But one of the things I'm trying to reconcile is the wholesale growth last year was 10%. So the production did single-digit, sales were 4%. Was some of that wholesale growth actually EV or inventory in channel? So that is one of the issues on the mix in Q4. Just anything you can add around the wholesale growth above production in the second half of the year. Thanks.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors",
    "content2": "Yeah. So keep in mind, last year, I think we ended at about 49 days of inventory, if I remember correctly. So we've had a fairly sizable build going in.\nTo be able to keep that 50 to 60-day target, as you know, coming into the Q3, we were sitting at about 67 days, and we were able to work through that with the demand that we saw in the Q4. So that's the overall assumption is that wholesales would be down a little bit because we didn't have that opportunity to build. What I would say is we do have a little bit of an opportunity to build that's not reflected here. We're being cautious about that just until we see the demand outcome and what some of the market going into 2025 is going to be.\nLike I said, I would have probably rather had a cleaner January month to be able to make some of those calls, but there's just been so much noise with the retail environment, with everything going on, weather-wise, inauguration, etc., that it's just a little bit too soon to call that build. But should we see consistent demand as we would expect, I think there's an opportunity to take some of that ICE wholesale volume up.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nThanks for taking the question. On the North American pricing guidance down 1% to 1.5, you're guiding for ICE volumes down, higher EV volumes. I would think EVs would come in at higher than ICE pricing. So it presumably means ICE pricing comes down below the 1% to 1.5 guidance.\nIf so, what level of pricing do you see the ICE portfolio in your 2025 guidance?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nI mean, thanks, Tom. I keep going back to this. When we talk about the pricing assumption, it's really a combination of ATP and the incentive environment. And what we found that has worked well for us in our internal planning and the setup is to assume that we see a little bit of pricing pressure going forward because it's easier for us to react. So what I would say is, yeah, we would expect a consistent ATP environment from what we've seen going forward. But we've modeled in the risk or the assumption that there's some incentive increases going forward, whether that's market-driven or demand-driven, etc. And if we don't see that, I would expect that we'll outperform that assumption as we have in years past.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nGot it. Thanks.\nMy follow-up on Super Cruise, I appreciate the comments on the adoption rate, etc. But wondering, to what extent do you think the regulatory kind of system is a support mechanism for level two plus, level three? Is this something that could ultimately be the real catalyst that pushes Super Cruise or level two, level three down the road? Or do you see this as just being consumer demand-driven? Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWe see it being consumer demand-driven. I mean, our customers, the bulk of people who have Super Cruise on their vehicles use it on a regular basis. I think it's over 60%.\nEspecially as we get newer and newer, or I said new features, it is definitely something where when people arrive at their destination after using Super Cruise, they're more rested, which is why 80% of our customers say they either wouldn't buy a car without it or they strongly would desire it to be on their next vehicle. We're going to look at Super Cruise being standard on our EVs from a Cadillac perspective, the Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, VISTIQ, OPTIQ, LYRIQ. So this is all, I think, opportunity for us for more people to experience Super Cruise and the way we have safely deployed this technology. So I see it very much consumer-driven.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nThe $2 to 4 billion of EV savings year-over-year the company was initially targeting for 2025 was driven about half by volume-related drivers. So as you're thinking about the $2 billion and expecting some EV wholesale growth, can you give us a bit more of a sense of how much of that $2 billion is coming from volume and how much is from other factors like materials and battery savings? And then to the extent there are changes in the policy environment, any sense you can share around what that might do to your EV volumes going forward?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Good morning, Mark. What I would say is it's probably about evenly split between scale benefits and other initiatives on cell cost efficiencies. We're continuing to ramp up cell site two as we talked about at investor day, and that's going to provide us some efficiencies going forward.\nThere are some material cost savings that we're starting to bake in, etc., but it probably split about 50/50 between there. I think any policy changes, as I said before, they're literally infinite iterations that you can go through in terms of demand, value of credits, and where we are on production tax credits, etc. So that's why we've built in the assumption that this is kind of status quo. We'll react to that, which we can. But we're going to continue to watch this. But this is our best estimate on where we are. And I think that's a good journey. Long-term, irrespective of what happens, as Mary has reiterated many times, this is about providing choice to consumers. And many consumers, as we've seen in the share data, are opting for our EVs.\nAs a matter of just corporate strategy, we've got to work, and we've got to be focused on making sure we get those to profitability. And we're on that journey. And I think the team is making good progress for that. And it's going to require a little bit of time to get there, depending on how quickly this scales up. But I think we've seen tremendous improvement already, and we're anticipating more of that in the future.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, and I would also just add that if there are factors that cause EV demand to lessen, we have a great ICE portfolio that we'd happily ramp up production beyond what we have in our current plans for this year. So again, that's that flexibility that Paul talked about.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's all very helpful. And then could you be a bit more specific around the assumptions for EV pricing?\nYou spoke already around how you're expecting it for GM in total, but it'd be helpful to have a better sense of the baseline assumptions around EV pricing. If the industry pricing does get more competitive to the extent there are policy changes, that could help us to better think through what EV profitability year-over-year may move to, to the extent there is more difficult pricing. Thanks.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. I think we're assuming fairly consistent pricing on EVs from what we've seen. And there is a lot of what I would say irrational incentive behavior out there in the market. Depending on what policy changes happen around stringency regulations, etc., we might see some of that incentive behavior tamp down because it's clear that people are out there selling EVs really for the sole purpose of compliance. So I think there are a lot of changes going forward.\nWe're continuing to just keep our head down, focus on building great products. And as you've seen from the chart that we included in the earnings deck, I would put our incentive discipline and our go-to-market strategies up against anybody in the industry in terms of the type of performance that our team is driving.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question, which is on China. It looks like you gained some pretty solid sequential traction there with sales rising 40% from Q3, driven by inexpensive EVs such as the Wuling Binguo. What is the profitability, though, of vehicles such as the Binguo or the Hongguang Mini EV look like? I'm just curious, what are the ways you can capitalize upon these high volume but low-priced and, I'm presuming, low-profit vehicles?\nDo you maybe benefit on the financing side or expect to benefit over time from aftermarket parts and services? Some other automakers have mentioned similarly priced vehicles in China might be unprofitable, but they can then make money when exporting them to higher cost markets. So it looks like some good commercial traction, but just curious your thoughts on the best way to take advantage of this brighter area of the China sales picture.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nSure. Well, Ryan, we don't talk about individual product profitability, but I would say that our joint venture with Wuling is known to be an incredibly efficient and low-cost producer. And to do that well, if you look at their whole portfolio, it kind of is in that space. So I think they're one of the leaders, I think, in doing that well before some of the other growth.\nAnd those are vehicles that are very popular with consumers as well. As you mentioned, there's all opportunities in addition to the profitability on the vehicle to continue to drive favorability. So beyond that, I can't comment on its specific profitability. We do work with Wuling and source some vehicles from Wuling to other markets, international markets, working with us to make sure the product meets the standards for each of those different countries. And we've been successful doing that.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thank you. Maybe lastly, a quick follow-up on your comments regarding capital allocation. I'm curious how some of the uncertainty surrounding regulation, particularly tariffs, could affect your thinking there.\nMight you potentially want to operate with more than the targeted $18 billion of gross cash for a time, or are you thinking any differently about the planned cadence of repurchases in 2025 until we gain greater clarity, maybe as soon as 1 April as per one of the executive orders signed last Monday? Or how are you thinking about this?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Hey, Ryan, what I would say is that our stated liquidity goals alongside our revolving credit facilities are a target that includes a whole host of risks and things that might happen to us. And when you look at the liquidity we had going into COVID, for example, that was enough at the time to get us that time going forward. So we're not anticipating having to build cash in anticipation of a big draw. And I would say it's going to be continued business as usual.\nWe're going to have to execute going forward. As others mentioned, we do have still a little bit of capacity left under the buyback, and we're going to continue to work with the board and allocate capital. But our free cash flow generation is strong, and we expect to continue to allocate that and ultimately share that with our investors.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThank you. And I want to close by thanking our team once again for their strong execution in 2024, which has set the business up for continued success in 2025. If you step back and look, we have a broad, deep, and compelling portfolio of internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs to meet customer demand, and it keeps getting stronger with the strength of our products.\nWe continue to innovate, and we're growing technologies like Super Cruise for today and L3 for the future, even moving to L4. We're profit-focused, and we're capital-disciplined with strong margins, cash flow, and a healthy balance sheet. I want to remind everybody we have demonstrated our agility many times over the last several years. Although there's a lot of uncertainty with some of the uncertainty, there's pluses in the column as well as not just negatives. We intend to capitalize on all of that. That's why I believe that 2025 is a year that is full of promise for General Motors. I look forward to sharing our progress with you and demonstrating once again how much the General Motors team is capable of delivering. So thank you again for joining, and I hope you all have a great day. Stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining."

We are asking analysts to limit their questions to one, and a brief follow-up. To ask a question, press star then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star then two. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, 23 July 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVP Investor Relations, General Motors\n\nThanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2024. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's investor relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO, and Paul Jacobson, GM's. Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward. Forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially.\nThese risks and uncertainties include the factors. Identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the Safe Harbor Statement on the first page of our presentation as. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn. The call over to Mary.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThanks Ashish and good morning everyone. I want to begin today's call by thanking the GM team as well as our dealers, suppliers, and other business partners for helping us deliver strong second quarter and first half results, including record revenue in both periods. There are four key drivers to our performance and our new higher guidance that I'd like to highlight. First, our past investments have created a consistently high performing portfolio of ICE trucks and SUVs from a volume, share, and margin standpoint. Next, our EV portfolio is scaling well and gaining market share. In fact, our U.S. EV deliveries grew 40% year-over-year in the second quarter while the industry grew at 11%. We're encouraged by these early results because disciplined volume growth is key to earning positive variable profits from our EV portfolio in the fourth quarter and maintaining strong ICE margins.\nThird, we continue to deliver stable pricing, and our incentives on average have been more than 100 basis points below the industry average for four consecutive quarters. Finally, with our new investments, we have even greater focus on margins and capital efficiency. Great vehicles and better execution will continue to differentiate us. In the first half, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra volumes in the U.S. were up a combined 5% versus a year ago, and we gained 3.5 points of market share with disciplined production and consistent pricing. In addition, sales of our redesigned Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickups were up 31% year-over-year with ATPs up 9%. In SUVs, we're executing a full court press with eight all-new redesigned compact, midsize, and full-size models that began arriving in showrooms during the second quarter.\nThey include some of our most profitable nameplates like the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, and the Buick Enclave, which will be available with Super Cruise for the first time. We designed Super Cruise to let customers drive hands-free for hours at a time on far more roads and with far fewer disengagements. Road testers at Edmunds.com rated Super Cruise the top hands-free driving system because it's confidence-inspiring and its technical differences between our system and others explain why Super Cruise is so smooth. The Chevrolet Equinox, our highest volume SUV, will also be all-new and we expect it to be more profitable than the outgoing model, just like our family of midsize Buick, GMC, and Chevrolet SUVs. This is a function of several strategic decisions we've made.\nFirst, the styling is bolder and more truck-like for the Chevrolets and GMCs, while the Buick Enclave adopts the brand's sophisticated new design language. Next, we elevated the comfort and technology features to make them even more desirable. Then we leveraged our proven platforms and component sets for lower cost and greater efficiency, winning with simplicity, which is our drive to eliminate unnecessary complexity in the way we engineer and equip our vehicles, will help ensure that we can continue to sustain and even improve our margins in the future. For example, through smarter contenting and optimizing selectable options, we have been able to eliminate more than 2,400 unique parts on 10 vehicles we're launching through Q1 2025. On the 2025 Cadillac LYRIQ alone, we've reduced the part count 24% from the 2024 model year with no compromises to performance or features.\nThe list of parts or subsystems that we no longer need to design, engineer, source, install, and warehouse is extensive and includes complex and relatively costly seat assemblies, consoles, door trims, and fascias. A crucial element is reducing the number of buildable electrical combinations, which is delivering hardware and software quality improvements as well as savings. The work is helping us meet our $2 billion fixed cost reduction program this year, and the savings will be even greater in the future. As I said before, our EV portfolio is growing faster than the market now that our module issues are resolved and we are scaling production. Our early sales are mostly incremental. About 54% of customers are new to GM, and we're working to increase our conquest rate by raising awareness and launching new models.\nOur best selling EV so far this year is the Cadillac LYRIQ and it is now the market leading luxury EV in 22 states including Florida, Texas, and Michigan. The GMC HUMMER EV and the Chevrolet Blazer EV are also building momentum to unleash the next cycle of EV growth. We're scaling production of the Chevrolet Equinox EV with its unique combination of performance, technology, range, and affordability. We delivered our first 1,000 units late in the second quarter and the reaction from customers, dealers, and the media is very strong, one product reviewer said. Chevy seems positioned to grab a piece of the pie that no one else has quite grabbed on to yet, and we think that is spot on. Then over the next several months, GMC will launch the Sierra EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ will be joined by the OPTIQ, Escalade IQ, and Celestiq.\nWe're especially excited about the OPTIC, Car and Driver said. It nails the compact luxury SUV formula. Then next year when we follow with the Vistiq, Cadillac will have a beautifully designed EV in every global luxury SUV segment. We're going to focus on winning new customers with these nameplates as well as with the next generation Chevrolet Bolt EV because they represent the largest growth opportunities for us. But we've also made adjustments to ensure we have a balanced approach as the market develops. This includes deferring Buick's first EV, which had been planned for 2024. As we're expanding choice, other barriers to EV adoption like public charging access are also improving. We are working to finalize commercial agreements with Tesla to give our customers access to their charging network, the IONNA fast-charging venture\nwe joined is expected to bring its first chargers online before the end of the year, and customers are telling us the drive-thru plazas we're rolling out with Pilot Company are the best public charging experience out there. As excited as we are about our portfolio, we are committed to growing responsibly and profitably in any demand environment over the next few years. Third-party forecasters now see the EV market growing steadily but more slowly than it did over the last few years. As a result, we are adjusting our spending plans to make sure we're capital efficient and moving in lockstep with customers. For example, our Ultium Cells joint venture continues to ramp up domestic battery cell supply this year, which is helping drive profit improvement in our EV portfolio. As we go forward, we're going to bring additional capacity online in a measured cadence.\nThis will enable us to better optimize our battery chemistry and form factors to meet our customers' needs on cost and range. We've also decided to reopen the Orion Assembly as a battery electric truck plant in mid-2026. The new timing is six months later than our plan. Heading into the year, we're confident that we can meet customer demand for standout EV trucks in the interim by leveraging the production capability and flexibility we have in Factory ZERO. We will also continue to take advantage of the flexibility we have to mix production between ICE and EV at key plants. Next, I'd like to discuss our results in China. As you know, the market has significant excess capacity, and many startups and established competitors continue to prioritize production over profitability.\nWe have been taking steps to reduce our inventories, align our production to demand, protect our pricing, and reduce fixed costs, but it's clear the steps we have taken, while significant, have not been enough. We had expected to return to profitability in China in Q2. However, we reported a loss, and we expect the rest of the year will remain challenging because the headwinds are not easy. We are working closely with our JV partner to restructure the business to make it profitable and sustainable. I'll close my opening comments by recognizing the progress Cruise has made over the last several months. As you know, Cruise has returned to the road in Houston, Phoenix, and Dallas, and we recently provided them with bridge financing to support their operational cash needs. We've also made several significant leadership appointments, including hiring Marc Whitten as CEO.\nMarc has decades of experience on the front lines of technology transformations, which will be crucial as we move forward. Our vision to transform mobility using autonomous technology is unchanged, and every mile traveled and every simulation brings us closer. Because Cruise is an AI-first company, we have some of the best engineers in tech building a cutting-edge AI platform harnessing the power of large-scale foundation models to continuously improve safe AV performance. The Cruise team will also simplify their path to scale by focusing their next autonomous vehicle on the next generation Chevrolet Bolt EV instead of the Origin. It's a win-win for both GM and Cruise.\nIt addresses the regulatory uncertainty we face with the Origin because of its unique design. Per unit costs will be much lower, which will help Cruise optimize resources and enable them to deliver AV tech and at scale as quickly as possible. The change will help GM fully leverage our investment in the Bolt EV with a major new customer for the product. We think all of these are important steps that will help us attract those who believe in the Cruise mission and see the incredible long term business opportunity of autonomous driving. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul to walk you through our financial results.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nThank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning. Our second quarter results were driven by ongoing strong performance from our ICE business and stable pricing across the portfolio that once again outperformed our guidance assumptions for the quarter. I'm pleased to share that pricing has remained relatively consistent thus far into July. As Mary mentioned, sales have been robust. We launched our new midsize SUVs supporting stable pricing and generating stronger profit margins than preceding models, highlighting our focus on profitable growth. Recent J.D. Power data showed that our U.S. incentive gap compared to the industry average is expanding. In the second quarter we ran roughly 150 basis points below the industry, while at the same time our U.S. retail market share increased by 70 basis points, more than offsetting the lower fleet volume to rental companies.\nOur EV portfolio is gaining momentum in Q2. Our US EV deliveries were up 34% sequentially from Q1, driven by the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac Lyriq. Moving forward, we'll also benefit from the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which delivers more than 300 miles of range and will be sub-$30,000 after factoring in the consumer tax credit on capital allocation. We repurchased $1 billion of stock in the quarter, retiring another 22 million shares, and in early July completed the prior $5 billion stock authorization. We ended the quarter with a fully diluted share count of 1.14 billion, a reduction of 18% from a year ago. The open market share repurchases supplement the ongoing $10 billion ASR that is projected to be completed in Q4 of this year, bringing our share count down to 1.1 billion.\nAs a reminder on the ASR, we paid the $10 billion upfront in December of last year and immediately retired 215 million shares in the first quarter. The first tranche was completed and we retired another four million shares in the second quarter. No additional shares were retired under the ASR as the banks continued to cover their positions in the 215 million shares they borrowed at the outset of the program. In the fourth quarter, we expect to retire another 20 to 30 million shares depending on several factors including the average share price during that period, bringing the total number of shares retired under the ASR to around 250 million. On top of these measures, last month the Board authorized an additional $6 billion for share repurchases.\nConsidering our belief that GM's share price is still undervalued, you should expect us to remain active in future share repurchases, continuing the great progress we have made towards our goal of driving our share count below 1 billion outstanding, getting into the second quarter. Results revenue was up 7% to $48 billion, driven by higher wholesale volumes and stable pricing. In North America, we achieved $4.4 billion in EBITDA adjusted, 9.3% EBITDA adjusted margins, and $3.06 in EPS diluted adjusted. Recall that in 2023, we had inventory valuation adjustments of $1.7 billion for battery cell and EV finished goods inventory. We expected the allowance to be substantially lower in 2024 as we improve EV profitability and reduce our inventory levels.\nWe made good progress in these areas during the second quarter and therefore reduced about $300 million of the allowance, and our guidance includes a similar benefit in both the third and fourth quarters, totaling around a $1 billion benefit for the full year. We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $5.3 billion during the second quarter, similar to last year and driven by our strong core operating performance coupled with our capital discipline. North America delivered second quarter EBITDA adjusted margins of 10.9%, which resulted in $4.4 billion of EBITDA adjusted, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. This was driven by higher wholesale volumes, stable pricing, ongoing cost containment, EV valuation allowance benefit, and a non-recurrence of the $700 million LG expense that we took last year.\nPricing for the quarter was up $300 million year-over-year and better than what we assumed in our guidance, supported by new products like the Chevrolet Traverse. Moreover, our HD pickups and full-size SUVs continue to drive robust demand while maintaining low incentives. We also benefited from our fixed cost reduction program, realizing $100 million from lower marketing spend compared to last year. We remain on track to achieve $2 billion of net fixed cost savings by the end of 2024. Dealer inventory levels ended the quarter at 66 days. This is temporarily above where we were tracking earlier in June, as we believe some sales for dealers using the CDK platform were delayed until the third quarter. We will continue to monitor our inventory and adjust production as necessary to maintain our targeted inventory levels of 50–60 days.\nGM International second quarter EBITDA-adjusted was $50 million, down $200 million year-over-year. China equity income was a loss of $100 million, down $200 million year-over-year. Mary already touched on the difficult China market and the immediate steps we have taken with our JV partner to return it to profitability as soon as possible. EBITDA adjusted in GM International excluding China Equity income was $150 million flat year-over-year, but improved more than $50 million sequentially from the first quarter. GM Financial has consistently performed well with second quarter EBIT adjusted of $800 million, up $50 million year-over-year and tracking in the range of $2.75–$3 billion for the full year. They continued to drive portfolio growth and paid a $450 million dividend to GM during the quarter.\nCruise expenses were $450 million in the quarter, down $150 million from a year ago, reflecting a reduction in operational activities and a technology improvement focus intended to meet the high performance bar expected for AVs. We are very conscious of spend while at the same time efficiently expanding operations across Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston. In addition, Mary explained how utilizing the next generation of the Chevrolet Bolt EV will aid in scaling our RoboTaxi business to create a more cost-effective and scalable option. However, the decision to pause the production of Cruise Origin triggered a charge of roughly $600 million which we recorded as a special item in the second quarter. Let's move now to our updated guidance.\nGiven the positive momentum we've seen thus far and our confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising full year 2024 guidance to EBITDA adjusted in the $13–$15 billion range, EPS diluted, adjusted in the $9.50–$10.50 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $9.5–$11.5 billion range. Our cash flow guidance increase is larger than our EBIT increase, primarily due to production alignment to market demand, and further working capital benefits over the balance of the year. I'd also like to address why the implied second half EBITDA, adjusted, is around $2.5 billion lower at the midpoint of our guidance range compared to the first half. There are three main reasons. First, we are assuming a bigger pricing headwind.\nOur guidance assumes pricing to be down 1%–1.5% year-over-year in the second half versus essentially flat in the first half, which is a substantial improvement from where we started the year. Second, roughly $1 billion of costs are second half weighted. This includes about $400 million higher marketing spend to support more launches in the back half of the year. The remainder is related to higher commodity prices, particularly copper, and aluminum, and the timing of other EV costs which we do not anticipate to be ongoing. Third, EV volumes are expected to build sequentially every quarter to achieve our full year target of 200,000–250,000. We produced and wholesaled 75,000 GM Ultium EVs in the first half of the year and expect this number to accelerate as we launch and ramp our new vehicles.\nAs a result, mix will be a bigger headwind in the back half of the year as EVs have a variable profit lower than the portfolio average. We continue to monitor EV demand and inventory levels very closely. We acknowledge that Ultium wholesales outpace customer deliveries by about 2–1 for the first half of the year. This, however, is common when introducing a new vehicle, given the need to build availability options and customer awareness as time goes on. If customer deliveries were to continue lagging wholesales, we will take proactive steps to balance production levels. The last item on EVs is that I'm pleased to report that we are making good progress towards achieving vehicle variable profit on our EV portfolio in the fourth quarter.\nKey drivers to reach this goal include improved manufacturing scale and efficiencies, including module and pack assembly, reduced cell costs from improved scale and performance at our Ultium Cells JV, including working through our inventory of cells produced with higher battery raw materials. This has helped reduce our average cell cost by roughly $30/kWh sequentially from the first quarter, and we expect further improvements in the second half of the year, and finally improved vehicle mix as we scale our electric full-size trucks and SUVs. In closing, we are committed to maintaining the strong financial performance we accomplished in the first half of the year and consistently adhering to our capital allocation framework. It is underpinned by a focus on cost containment, capital efficiency, and agility in navigating the complexities of our business.\nWe are differentiating ourselves from our peers with superior product offerings and improving execution. We are market leaders in the truck and full-size SUV segments, growing market share in affordable SUVs, and our refreshed midsize SUVs are some of the fastest growing vehicles in the segment while yielding higher profitability than the preceding models. At the same time, we are growing and improving profitability on our EV portfolio along with developing a world-class software organization and making steady progress at Cruise. As always, our customers and their safety will be at the center of everything we do and is fundamental to our continued success. This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder to analysts, we are asking that you limit your questions to one and a brief follow up so that we may get to everyone on the call. To ask a question, press star then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star, then two. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Wanted to start first with a question on pricing. If you could just provide a bit of context on the pricing strength we've seen not only in Q2 but in Q1. If you just look at the incentives, the incentives are clearly up, but your pricing has actually been net flat. Any color behind this? And then maybe you could just talk. To the sustainability of this. In light of the fact that we've seen some inventory normalization but prices held in. Do you view this price as sustainable beyond this year? Factoring in that there is going to be some increase in incentives as inventory picks up further from here.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah, good morning Dan, thanks for the question. First of all, so you know what I would say is that obviously we've been very disciplined about our commercial strategy and going to market, and despite the fact that we've seen a little bit of pressure year-over-year on incentives, we've actually widened the gap in the quarter.\nAgainst our competitive set. So demand for our vehicles is strong. I think some of the offsets are our truck sales were up 5% in the quarter. We continue to pick up share, and that's helped to offset some of the lower ATP vehicles than we've seen in the growth in the Trax, for example. So I think we've been saying for a long time that our consumer has held up really well, and it's been resilient, and we expect that to continue to be the same way. I think a big part of that is the strategy that we've undertaken about being very disciplined in inventory and the more data flow about producing the vehicles that we know that customers are demanding. And when you combine that with the incredibly strong portfolio we have, I think this is the result.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you. As a follow up, wanted to ask about your EV strategy and this is in light of maybe some of the potential changes we may be seeing in the regulatory environment given the upcoming election. There is obviously one candidate in the US Presidential election who talked about pulling back the EV mandate and maybe there's some implications on things like IRA or EPA. So to what extent, if we see pullback in some of these standards, does that modify your EV strategy? Is your EV strategy one that is. Driven more by regulations or do you? View your EV strategy as a bit more fixed given the long-term strategic of GM and also just the longer planning cycles for products?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThanks for the question. Our strategy is to offer our consumers choice. We've got an incredible portfolio of vehicles, both EV and ICE, and we've got flexibility. So we know we can win more customers as they embrace EVs. We're seeing that right now with 54% of the customers, the EV sales being customers that are new to GM. And so we do think the market for EVs will continue to grow. And we've got the performance, the technology, and the range that customers want. Especially when you look at our portfolio with the Equinox coming out right now, the affordability of that vehicle, along with when we have the Bolt next year, we're giving consumers that choice. And as I've said, EVs are fun to drive. Instant torque. I think our EVs have beautiful designs, the right range, the right performance. So again, we'll be guided by the consumer.\nRegardless of what the regulatory environment is, regardless, we're going to work to maximize because we've got that flexibility between ICE and EV. So I think we're in a very strong position. I think we also have to look at, though, the investments GM's made in EVs. We're creating thousands of jobs all over the country, including Ohio, Michigan, and Tennessee. So I'm pleased with where our strategy is. I think regardless of what happens from a regulatory perspective, we're going to be well positioned with our ICE and with our EV portfolio.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVP Investor Relations, General Motors\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nDirector, Citi\n\nGreat everyone, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe a first question for Paul back on the second half Bridge. And thank you for the color. On the 1.5% negative pricing assumption. How does that compare to what you're assuming for the industry in the second half? And also how should we think about a high level sensitivity to EV volume target second half of the year? If the volumes are becoming lower, think about the puts and takes in the model for that. And secondly, maybe for Mary on Cruise. How are you thinking about strategically taking Cruise to market as a ride-share operator as opposed to maybe finding partners to deploy on the next generation Bolt?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nThanks, Itay. I'll go ahead and start with the first questions on the second half. We tend to stay very, very focused on what we see for pricing for ourselves. Obviously, there's a lot of noise going on with different incentive strategies, different inventory levels, et cetera. So that's an assumption that we bake in based on what we're seeing in the market and making sure that we're projecting the right amount of conservatism against our cash flow targets and plans. So we started the year saying down two to two and a half. We got through the first half of the year essentially flat. And what I would say is July to date looks very similar to June. So we're going to continue to push through month by month, quarter by quarter on the portfolio that works for us.\nSo we've managed to do that through various incentive strategies and various inventory pushes that we've seen from our competitors. We're going to just be focused on meeting our customer demand the best we can.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nAnd AJ, as it relates to Cruise, we've worked very hard. As you look at what's happening with Artificial Intelligence applications across many industries, customers have an expectation of higher performance from technology than they necessarily do in our case, for other human beings. So our target now, instead of being better than an average driver, is to be better than a role-model driver. And tremendous work has gone on over the last few months. So as we are rolling out now in the three cities I mentioned, the technology is much more advanced to be better than a role-model driver. We've also expanded our safety metrics to make sure it measures across many scenarios. So I'm very confident as we now have the vehicles operating and we're on the path very quickly to get back to driverless with much safer technology.\nAgain, getting to this better than a role-model driver. So when I look at that, we can provide an exceptional driver experience as we continue to grow. Now, when you talk about what is the right balance between expansion, capital demands, and partners and or investors. We're very open, and we're seeing significant interest in Cruise. So as we move into this next phase, we're going to be looking at what's the right efficient way to go forward with Cruise from a RoboTaxi business, from a Cruise perspective. But also we are staying very laser focused on the personal autonomous vehicle opportunity for GM. So we think we're well positioned. We'll share more as we go through the year. But we have significant outside interest from a partner and investor perspective.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nDirector, Citi\n\nTerrific. That's all very helpful. Thank you.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nItay, let me just go back. I think I missed the second part of your question on the sensitivity of the EV volume from that. So you know, you saw when we originally gave our guide on production, we were at 200,000–300,000. We talked about being able to get to variable profit positive in the low 200,000. We're still holding to that, although with the 200,000–250,000 we pulled that from the second half to the fourth quarter. So I know it doesn't give you a specific answer, but directionally, obviously scale is a big part of what we're doing. A lot of the battery costs, cell cost improvement that we've seen has just been driven by efficiency and scale at the plant. So it's something that we continue to watch and we're continuing to strive for. But nothing more specific than that.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nDirector, Citi\n\nTerrific. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJoseph Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Paul, thanks for all the additional color on costs in the back half. I guess to counter some of those higher costs you mentioned. Right. You still have the fixed cost savings program. You're on track for the $2 billion. If we're sort of tracking this, it looks like you did maybe $1 billion last year and maybe $400 million in the first half. So another $600 million in the back half. I just want to make sure that's sort of ballpark correct and if it is. Just maybe some color on why it's actually accelerating or higher, because I think, like, if we think about last year, the costs also were more back-end loaded. So it's sort of a tougher comp. So what else is being done here to drive the cost savings higher?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Good morning, Joe. Thanks for the question. So I would say directionally your math is pretty accurate on about the $1.4 billion of the $2 billion. You know, I would look at the biggest cost increase that we highlighted on the call is about $400 million of marketing spend, and that is first half to second half. So marketing spend overall is still down significantly, and the team has done a great job of driving more efficiency into what we're doing. But obviously with the launches that we have in the second half of the year, there's a significant lean in to drive that customer awareness. And we think that's actually an opportunity for us to help us scale and to help us see outsize share gains in EVs.\nSo I would say it's timing within the larger pool of significant savings initiatives out of that category that's the biggest piece of it. But we're continuing to work on it and we believe that we'll be successful in that $2 billion cost reduction target that we laid out. And we're not going to stop there.\n\nJoseph Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nOkay, thanks for that first half. Second half, clarification on the marketing, and then Mary, just on the Origin decision, obviously some cost savings, but I guess is there also, and I know, I think you're still undergoing the strategic review for Cruise, but does this also indicate a change in go-to-market strategy and sort of not having that purpose-built vehicle? Like, what were some of the other considerations? Is sharing just not really, you think, viable for that business model, or are there other use cases versus what you're originally planning for?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nI think that the main reason is with switching from the Origin to the Bolt is we extinguish the regulatory risk. Remember, because the Origin doesn't have steering wheel and some other Motor Vehicle Safety Standards components.\nIt doesn't meet motor vehicle safety standards. That requires a legislative change. We've been working on that. It's been difficult to get done. And with that, if we don't get that legislative change or authorization from a government perspective, we're limited in the number of Origins we could put out. So as we looked at this, we thought it was better to get rid of that risk. And then when we look at the Bolt, it's been, I think, a very good product for the initial rollout from an AV perspective where we have over 5 million miles traveled and it allows us to be more capital efficient and get better scale on the Bolt EV as we roll it out next year based on the Ultium Platform. So I would say it was mainly driven by the uncertainty that we have from a regulatory perspective.\n\nJoseph Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Roeska with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Dan from Bernstein, maybe following on the EV questions we've had, could you elaborate a bit on your outlook for emissions compliance, kind of, if we stay within the current EPA Framework, kind of, what level of drivetrain mix credits would you expect to need to have to achieve the '27 targets? And then following on from Dan's question earlier, if any administration or either administration should decide to revisit the EPA targets, could you outline what you would expect, what the timeline would be to actually be effective for 2027? So what is the latest point in time when an administration, then the EPA would need to kick off kind of that process to revisit the '27 targets? Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nSure. Well, for General Motors to comply with the existing regulations, we have many levers that we can pull, including how we plan our portfolio, the technology that we use on the vehicles. We can utilize credits from prior and future model years and purchase credits, as well as have a robust EV portfolio. So we look at this on a regular basis, based on what's happening with EV adoption, based on what's happening with the regs, and make those decisions. It's something we have a lot of flexibility, and obviously we intend to meet the regulatory environment. It's really hard for me to predict.\nWhat the timeline would be if something is going to change. I would say, though, that we look at our portfolio on a regular basis with not only what we know the regs to be and make sure we have a plan there, and then we do scenario planning for what potentially could happen, and then we have that range of opportunities, so we'll continue with that process. I mean, if you think about it, for the last several years, the regulatory environment has not been certain. I would say what's really important to the company overall is to have regulatory certainty. So we'll be watching with interest as we, you know, as we get past the election and look at what the, you know, what the regs will be, if they change at all. But I think we have the flexibility to moderate based on what we see.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThanks, Mary. And maybe following up, if the regulations for 27 kind of stay as they are right now with a more ambitious path, what role could mild or full hybrids kind of play in your portfolio? And if they stay as ambitious as they are right now, would you consider to kind of increase your focus on hybrid drivetrains in the U.S.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, as we've said, we plan to have hybrids in key segments, not across the board, but in key segments in the 2027 timeframe because of where the regulatory environment looks to be right now. So we have that opportunity. We can decide what we put on the fleet or what segments we put based on where we see the regulatory environment. So that's definitely one of the technologies that we can leverage. And as we've already said, we plan to have hybrids in key segments in the 27 timeframe.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGreat, thanks for confirming that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAutomotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, it is the strong performance in North America that is the driver of the total company results. Certainly, congrats on that. I did think to ask, though, in the performance in China, including after. It was a little surprising to see the equity loss fairly consistent with Q1 despite a solid rebound in both wholesales and non-consolidated revenue. I know you don't provide a detailed bridge for the non-consolidated affiliates specifically, but from the sequential volume change, it would seem to imply in either price, mix, or cost headwind, quarter over quarter. I'm guessing price given some of the comments from other automakers in that country. But perhaps you can fill us in there.\nThen I'm not sure if you're able to comment on what actions might be being considered in conjunction with your partner, but should we expect more, that you are building a portfolio of vehicles, maybe NEVs that you expect could gain greater traction, or are you contemplating more right-sizing actions or some combination? And if you were to undertake right-sizing actions, I can't really remember you reducing capacity in that country before, at least not structurally. So perhaps you could update us on what kind of flexibility you might have in that market to take capacity out. How does it compare to North America today, for example, or maybe to Europe in the past when you operated in that region? Thank you.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. First off, we continue to see the challenges in China. You know, very few people are making money, and a lot of OEMs are prioritizing production over profitability. So I think the work that we have been more disciplined than most in our pricing. We are launching some new vehicles that we're seeing positive traction. But it's a difficult market right now, and, frankly, it's unsustainable because the amount of companies losing money there cannot continue indefinitely. And really when you get into the type of pricing war that's going on now, it's really a race to the bottom and destroy residuals. There's nothing good that comes from the behavior that we're seeing right now.\nHaving said that, we've taken several steps of getting our inventory right, launching some products that we think are going to be better received than some of the NEVs we had a couple years ago, especially hybrids and full electric. And then as it relates to the work that we're doing with our partner, out of respect for our partnership, I will provide more details as the decision is made, but I'm not going to go into detail of all the different. Items that we're contemplating.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAutomotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thank you. Maybe you could comment quickly too on the trend in your other international operations, including in consolidated operations in Korea and Brazil. Too curious on the trend there. Thank you.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWhen you say the trend you're talking about? Can you say a little bit more what you're specifically.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAutomotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThe trend in the profitability in those markets for you.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYou know, I would say in our GM international markets outside of China, we're seeing strong pricing. You know, if you look at South America, for example, Chevy is considered a premium or luxury brand. And we've got a really strong portfolio. We have great, great brand loyalty and brand recognition. And we're seeing, we're able to hold pricing and compete, by the way, because of the value of the Chevy Chevrolet branded products. Again, in different. We're seeing that across to varying levels across all of the international markets. So, again, disciplined execution pays off over the longer period. And this is. A long game that we play when we look at managing our brand strength, managing the residuals of our products, et cetera.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAutomotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush. Your line is open.\n\nDan Ives\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wedbush\n\nYeah, thanks, Tamara. I have a question with. When you think about new GM customers. Looking at EVs and that trend's been high, is that something that you expect? To continue or maybe even could accelerate. Depending on the models and the price points, when you look out the next one to two years?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nAbsolutely. Dan. I believe when you look at the portfolio entries that we have coming, the fact that we have fresh designs, the performance, and technology on these vehicles along with the range is great. So for those that are already EV Intenders that might want to replace the existing EV they have, the response we're getting from dealers about the new Equinox EV is just outstanding when they say they look at the design of the vehicle, the performance, and the affordability, especially with the consumer tax credit. So I think we have an opportunity to continue to outperform where the industry is, and we're going to look to build on that because we really believe in our portfolio. That's why we're spending the marketing dollars to make sure we get the awareness, and our dealers are excited. So I feel like we're well positioned to continue that growth.\n\nDan Ives\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wedbush\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director and Lead U.S. Auto Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning everybody. I just wanted to follow up on pricing and Paul. I mean, you guys updated your guidance and are a little bit optimistic, more optimistic about what's going on in the second half than you had for the full year and had good performance in the first half. But as we think about pricing, there's two components that are, I think, being left out of the equation. The first is over the last two years we've seen a 400 basis points increase in loan rates. Dumb guys math. On a $50,000 ATP, that's $2,000 a year, four-year ownership cycle, that's $8,000 headwind to your consumer. And you have dealers earning twice as much as they did in 2019 now. So they have $2,000 to kind of potentially throw into the equation to help get deals done.\nSo there's, as rates come down and dealers get more realistic about what they can earn on your vehicles, I mean, isn't there a lot of room to support pricing, whereas, and potentially, God forbid, as rates come down, pricing to go up. I think everybody kind of has this view that it's going to fade, but it might be much more resilient and stronger over the next year or two than people are expecting. What's your take on those two points?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah, thanks, John. What I would say is it starts with the portfolio. When you look at the refreshes that we've done, what we brought to market, and what's still to come with the midsize SUVs, I think the team has done really an incredible job and that's actually held up quite well even as we went to higher interest rates. Despite the fact that payments have gone up, we've seen demand hold pretty steady across the board. We want to maintain some level of consistency, which is make sure that we approach the plan, the forward calendar with a little bit of conservatism on the pricing side versus what we're seeing in the market today because that's, it's really all about continuity on cash flow and margin performance. I think it's a strategy that's worked well for us.\nLike I said, despite the fact that we've taken that assumption down in the back half of the year from where we started the year, we're still not seeing that in the month of July to date. So I think this helps us be more nimble, be more agile, and look around corners customers. But our commercial team is doing a really good job of go to market strategies and really looking at it on a month by month, product by product basis to drive our optimal margin performance.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director and Lead U.S. Auto Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nSo we really should think about this as a planning assumption as opposed to an actual forecast. Is that a fair statement?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah, that's the way we've consistently referred to it.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director and Lead U.S. Auto Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. And then just one follow-up. You know, Paul, when we look at your tables, I always ask about this: 108% in North America to shift straight time. God forbid we saw an actual increase in unit volume up 5% to 10% for you and maybe the industry alike. What kind of cost would flow back into the system? Would we be thinking about mostly variable costs? Obviously with that high cap you might think that you might have a little bit of fixed cost that could come in as well. But I'm just curious how you would think about that cost flow if we got a real volume lift of up 5% to 10%.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, first of all, we'd be very excited about that because I think it's a huge opportunity, and I think for the bulk of it it would be variable cost increases because we've got the equipment, adding shifts, increasing line rates. So it's always fun to take volume up, and I think we're well prepared to do that. And it would mostly be variable.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director and Lead U.S. Auto Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you so much, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks so much, team. Great quarter. Paul, maybe just a question around the variance that maybe remains in the guide. So, as has been discussed, just high level, the pricing has gone from 2% assumption for the full year to sort of, you know, 0.75% given your second half comments. If I just run that, that pricing variance of 50 basis points for this, for just the second half, about $400 million variance. Maybe you can go through some of the other aspects that are sort of left to be determined because it seems like there's a lot in your control. So maybe you know, China and any of the cost reductions just how we sort of fill that other $1.5 billion in the variance in the guidance.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors",
    "content2": "Yeah, so thanks for that, Chris, and thanks for the kind words. What I would say is that if you look at from where we started the year, it's about probably $2 billion of trend line improvement from our initial guide. We've taken our guidance up now by $1 billion. The other $1 billion I would say is largely China underperformance. We started the year thinking that we were going to be similar to last year's profitability. Obviously, we've taken that down. Then the second big area is really on EV volumes. So despite the fact that they come in at a lower contribution, we were projecting on the higher volumes a variable profit contribution in Q3 that has now been kicked out a little bit on the lower volumes. That explains really the bulk of it.\nBut, you know, I'm really pleased that we've been able to take our guidance up now in two consecutive quarters, and we're a full $1 billion at the middle point ahead of where we were at the beginning of the year.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThat's a great summary because yeah, that was my second question. Okay, so pricing from the beginning of the year $2 billion better. $1 billion is now reflected in the guide. And the $1 billion offset is a combination of some China variants. It's underperforming, probably. Second half is a little bit left to be determined. And also EV volumes. Is that a fair summary?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nPerfect. Thanks so much, team.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nStock Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, good morning. Congratulations on the strong results, and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned watching EV inventory levels closely and using demand as a guide for how fast you ramp up EV production. To the extent GM does less than the 200,000 EV wholesales this year you're currently contemplating, could the company still be variable profit positive in Q4, perhaps with incremental cost actions?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nHey, Mark, thanks. Thanks for the kind words and appreciate the question. You know, I would say that when we started the year, we were looking at getting to variable profit in the low 200,000 range. We're obviously continuing to do the work that we need to do on the lower volumes, and we see that. I mean, to the extent that we see volumes going lower, we obviously have to adjust to that. But we're really focused on the long term here. And that is the trend trajectory of scaling up in the business. We're already seeing meaningful cost improvements as we ramp up the battery cell plants and really come off some of the imported cells and things that we were doing last year. So this is a journey for us and it's one that we're absolutely focused on doing.\nSo we don't want to end up in a situation where we're just producing to a target and the demand isn't there. We've seen what happens when you do that and you've got residual value implications which stay with you for a long, long time. So that balance is what's most important to us and continuing along the journey. So we're focused right now on that 2 to 250 and believe that we can hit the variable profit positive in the fourth quarter, and we're going to continue to work towards that the best we can.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nStock Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nUnderstood, thanks. Another question was on GM Financial. It looks like you slightly raised the EBITDA outlook for the year to $2.75 to 3 billion. I think as of the first quarter you were thinking $2.5 to 3 billion. Maybe. Talk about what's driving the slight uptick in GM Financial and more broadly on the financial market and auto finance. We've heard and read about some rising delinquencies for the industry more generally. Maybe speak about GM Financial and any change in delinquency rates. Thank you.\n\nDan Berce\n\nPresident and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, hi, this is Dan Berce. So on the first part of your question, with respect to the uptick in the lower end of the guide, you know we obviously had a strong first half at GMF earning $1.6 billion, which puts us in a really good position to hit in that range of $2.75 to 3.\nThe couple factors that would be headwinds in the second half are that we're going to have less lease terminations in the second half along with expectations for mildly lower used car pricing. And then the second factor in the second half is that our credit, typically seasonally in the second half, is weaker than the first half, so our provisions will be higher. So that that's really the reason for a slightly weaker second half. Now with respect to your question about credit trends, first of all, baseline, our portfolio at GMF is 75%+ prime and we're seeing very, very steady performance for the prime customer. They still have excess savings. Obviously the job market is strong and so that piece of our portfolio has been really stable.\nNow the less than prime, like other lenders, we've seen a bit of deterioration, mostly from vintages in 2022 and 2023. More recently we've seen stabilization. Albeit at slightly higher levels, but we've seen stabilization in that part of our portfolio.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nStock Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nYes, thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on Level 2+ subscription take rates. Tesla is seeing what many would describe as somewhat disappointing. I think single-digit percentage take rates of its FSD product. BMW told us last week they're seeing 30%+ take rates on its 5 Series in California, and its pricing is a lot lower than Tesla's. Just curious if you've given your take rates on Super Cruise or if you had any commentary on what you think drives demand there. There's a saying that safety is boring. Perhaps it was all about pricing. Just love to hear any thoughts there. And then I have a follow up. Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYou know, our Super Cruise ramp has been slow because some of the chip availability that we have. We're now expected by year end this year to have Super Cruise on 22 nameplates and, in some cases, on upper trims. For instance, on the new Traverse, it's standard. So I don't have the specific take rates because part of it is it comes with the vehicle, and some of it can be something they can subscribe to. So we can follow up with you after the fact on that.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. And Tom, I'll just add it's a little bit too early because we're coming through that trial period in significant volumes. So we should have a lot more color, I would say, over the next 12 to 18 months as we start to see people lapse out of their three year period and getting to that. But it's obviously something that we're watching and the commercial team's all over it.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nGreat, thanks. And then, as a quick follow-up. Actually, to Joe's Cruise question, I understand that the pivot here to Bolt, but I remember the decision to do Origin was largely an economic one. Just curious if you're still in tandem to the new approach, still going to continue maybe lobbying for this purpose-built vehicle to regulators. Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, we definitely will be looking for frankly more than just what the vehicle is, but to have the right regulatory environment to release this technology that we believe definitely improves safety of miles traveled for. So we're going to continue to work hard to continue to allow autonomous technology, both ride-share and from a PAV perspective to continue.\nAnd frankly, switching to the Bolt at this time because of the regulatory environment actually improves Cruise's costs. So we think it's a win-win. But we're in the early, early phases of what ride-share is going to be and how we're going to leverage autonomous technology. I do think in the future there's going to be opportunity for a vehicle like the Origin, and so that remains open to us at the right time. This was about getting costs down at Cruise and being able to scale without regulatory uncertainty.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from. Excuse me. Comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nHead of U.S. Autos, BNP\n\nHi, good morning everyone. To follow up on China challenges are expected for the second half, but just. To put a finer point on this Is the expectation for JV losses to sustain in Q3 and Q4, and then just high level, what are. The pillars here to GM's China strategy going forward? What should turn this around as we consider next year and beyond?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, I think critical is we've got to get our structural costs right to the new realities of this market. And so we are fully recognizing the ongoing challenges that we have. And so we're going to. There's really a three-pronged strategy. We've got to execute the plan to align production to the current retail reality, get rid of the existing higher inventories, and then aggressively reduce the structural cost. From an SGMW perspective, we actually maintain the stable market share as this operation is very important and also supports some of the global emerging markets through exports. From a General Motors perspective and then as we talked about in the past and Paul mentioned it, we have the premium channel where we believe we have an opportunity to export with very low.\nCapital investment, very capital efficient, I should say, to take some of our most iconic products and export them into the market at the top end. So I think when we look at the strength of the Buick brand and the China brand, there's a path forward in this market that we do believe over the course of the midterm is going to resume to growth. So that is our plan. And I'm not going to predict where we're going to be exactly in Q2. I will just tell you we're working aggressively to improve that situation and leverage what we have in GMW and also the opportunity that we'll have with the premium channel.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nHead of U.S. Autos, BNP\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just with respect to the second half versus first half, can you? Provide additional color on the $1 billion. In additional costs that were referenced for the second half? What's driving that outlay and has this? Number changed versus your prior guidance? Thanks.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah, James. So you know, the biggest piece of it as we highlighted is about $400 million of marketing spend which is seasonally weighted towards the second half of the year in conjunction with a number of the launches that we have. We knew that going into the year. The other big pieces of it, I would say there are some commodities and EV cost retime. So these are a little bit new. Just as we've kind of pivoted on our assumptions going forward. The commodities, look, we're going to respond to that and we always do. But those are the three biggest categories I would say on the second half and the team is working through it and feel good about our performance so far.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nHead of U.S. Autos, BNP\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThank you very much. I hope everybody can see that from our results and our higher guidance. We are making the most of every opportunity we have in ICE and EV, and leveraging our core strengths. We're being flexible and opportunistic, but also importantly, we're being very disciplined. A better Cruise is moving forward once again, and there's significant opportunity there. We're going to continue to return significant capital to our owners as we move forward and the opportunity presents itself. If you look back, this was a great first half, and we're going to build on it and continue to improve the business, and we have more opportunity to continue to do that to drive our future success. We're going to expand on all these topics at our Investor Day in Spring Hill, Tennessee. So I hope you will attend.\nYou're going to have a chance to drive our newest ICE and EV products and see up close our cell manufacturing expertise and our manufacturing flexibility. We think it's compelling and we look forward to having that session with all of you. So thank you very much for joining and I hope you have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect."

We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for Q1 2024. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO, and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC.\nPlease review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation, as the content of our call will be governed by this language. With that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. In January, we outlined clear priorities for 2024 that are designed to build on our strengths and learn from the challenges we faced in 2023. I'm very pleased to share that the team is executing well against all of them. Around the world, we are very focused on growth and profitability, which means taking full advantage of our winning product portfolio to grow share without chasing unprofitable business. In North America, the fundamental strengths of Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac truly stand out. The team delivered a 10.6% EBIT margin in the quarter, thanks to our industry-leading full-size pickups, the momentum we're building in mid-size pickups, the growth we are seeing in our SUV business, profit improvement in our EV portfolio, and our overall operating discipline. We again grew retail shares and market share in the US.\nduring the quarter with incentives that remained well below the industry average, especially in our truck business. We grew our combined Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickup sales by 3% year over year and grew our retail market share 1.8 points to 43.8% with much lower incentives than our closest competitors, whose sales were down. In March, we doubled sales of the GMC Canyon year over year, and the Chevrolet Colorado was the fastest-growing truck in the mid-size pickup segment, thanks to its purity of function, simple elegance in execution, and value. Those are Motor Trend's words, not mine. We also continue to gain market share and grow EBIT with our new small SUVs, including the Chevrolet Trax and the Buick Envista. These vehicles are helping us win new customers, and we will continue to excel at customer retention.\nDuring the quarter, S&P Global Mobility announced that GM has now had the highest loyalty of any OEM for nine consecutive years. That's a powerful competitive advantage. In our EV business, we are building momentum in production and profitability. For example, we have increased battery module production by 300% over the last six months. Quality is very good and continuing to improve, and the installation and validation of our new high-speed module assembly lines is on track. We are projecting to double our current capacity by the end of the summer. EV production rose sharply during the quarter, and our dealers translated that into a 21% year-over-year increase in EV retail customer deliveries. For example, the Cadillac Lyriq outsold all of the EVs from European luxury brands in Q1, and since mid-March, we are now delivering Chevrolet Blazer EVs with updated and improved software.\nAll of our product programs are benefiting from the end-to-end improvements we've made in software, including the increased rigor we have instilled in our quality and validation processes. More importantly, the talented executives and engineers we've hired from the tech industry are raising the bar for software design and execution, which will help us truly differentiate our customer experience and the suite of software-driven products and services we offer. We're also making progress at Cruise. The team is back on the road in Phoenix, updating mapping and gathering more road information. This is a critical step for validating our improved self-driving system and building upon the more than 5 million driverless miles we've logged before the pause. We are engaging frequently with regulators and stakeholders and building trust as we regain momentum. Safety will remain front and center and will guide our progress.\nI am pleased with our ICE performance, our progress in EV execution and growth, our new software organization's performance, and the steps we're taking to regain momentum at Cruise. In addition, I'm very proud of the GM team and all of our stakeholders for really leaning in to keep our momentum going. Their commitment and tenacity helped give us the confidence to raise our full-year 2024 EBIT, EPS, and automotive-adjusted free cash flow guidance. In our ICE business, the redesigned Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, and Chevrolet Equinox are all launching in high-volume segments starting this quarter. So are the Chevrolet Spin and the S10 in South America, and they have higher margins than the outgoing models. Then this summer, the stunning new Buick Enclave will arrive. It's the first Enclave to offer Super Cruise.\nLater in the year, we will make important design and technology upgrades to our best-selling GMC Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe, and Chevrolet Suburban full-size SUVs. They include redesigned, tech-focused interiors, safety and security features that include a suite of connected cameras, ride and handling improvements, styling enhancements, and more. Mark and our performance team also have the unbelievable Corvette ZR1 coming, and we can't wait to put customers behind the wheel. We've already begun installing equipment at our Fort Wayne Assembly plant to produce our next-generation full-size ICE pickups. In our EV business, the Ultium Cells plant in Spring Hill is shipping cells and scaling production through the year. The Chevrolet Equinox EV will arrive in showrooms this quarter, and we're very excited because it will be the most affordable long-range EV in the market.\nIt will also offer Super Cruise, like all of our Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac EVs on the Ultium platform. We will then introduce more affordable trim series for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Blazer EV, and the Silverado EV in the second half of the year, which will help grow volume and share. Also, in the second half of the year, Cadillac will expand its EV lineup to include the Optiq and the Escalade IQ. This is important because EV adoption in luxury segments is higher and more resilient than in the broader market. Two of our most highly anticipated launches are the GMC Sierra EV Denali and the Chevrolet Silverado EV RST. They are best in class in ways that truly matter to truck customers.\nBy optimizing the battery, aerodynamics, and other systems, we were able to increase the range of the RST and the Denali by 10% to an estimated 440mi, which is about 40mi better than the median range of ICE vehicles on the road today. No EV pickup on the road today even comes close, and it's possible to go even farther. A few weeks ago, two road testers took the RST on a drive from Las Vegas to Phoenix, and they drove it like customers do, on paved and gravel roads, at freeway speeds, at different temperatures, and different elevations. At the end, they managed to travel 460mi on a single charge. It's the same story for towing. One journalist drove a Silverado EV work truck and three competing battery-electric trucks on a 500mi trip over the Rocky Mountains while towing trailers. It wasn't even a competition.\nThe Silverado EV stopped once to charge while every other truck had to stop four to five times. Chevrolet and GMC are also the only pickup brands that allow drivers to tow while using Super Cruise, our hands-free driving technology. That's just one of the several features that uniquely differentiates our products. This is exactly the kind of design and engineering functionality that excites people, motivates them, and turns them into customers. It's the same formula for Chevrolet and GMC have followed with ICE trucks, and those results speak for themselves. Based on the feedback we're hearing from customers and dealers, the early sales momentum we are seeing, we're confident that continuing to scale EV production is the right move.\nWe know that transparency matters in every transformation, so Paul and I will give you regular updates throughout the year, including at our investor day we're planning for this fall, as we achieve our EV production, sales, and profitability milestones. All of these great ICE and EV products were made possible by the investments we made to drive transformation and growth. As a result, our spending was above historic levels for several years. Now that the foundation is largely built and we're starting to see results, our focus has turned back to driving free cash flow through enhanced profitability and capital discipline, finding ways to spend less for the same results and with an unwavering focus on the customer. You're already seeing some examples of this. Our winning with simplicity discipline is a great example of how we're improving capital efficiency and lowering costs.\nThe next-generation Ultium-based Chevrolet Bolt EV is another. It's a profitable and capital-efficient program that will deliver one of the most affordable electric vehicles around when it arrives in late 2025. There will be many more examples as we move forward. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul to take you through our results and our new higher guidance for the calendar year.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nThank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning. We're off to a good start to the year, and I'd like to thank our team for all their hard work in helping deliver another strong set of financial results. We experienced consistent pricing trends during the quarter, below the 2% to 2.5% headwind we built into our full-year guidance. For Q1, pricing was down only about $200 million year-over-year, driven by demand for our products and a disciplined go-to-market strategy that prioritizes profitability and margins. So far in April, we've seen pricing remain relatively consistent. That said, our comparisons get tougher as we lap price increases taken in Q2 of last year. The US retail industry experienced a slight mixed shift away from the full-size truck segment during the quarter.\nHowever, we increased our volume and share with lower incentives than our competitors, which speaks to our strong truck franchises and our customer loyalty. Retail sales were up 6%, while fleet sales decreased more than 20%, driven by two main factors. First, we encountered some production constraints impacting the timing of fleet deliveries on our commercial van and mid-size pickups. We expect to recover most of this volume in the second half of the year. Second, we made the strategic decision to produce more retail full-size SUVs compared to last year to satisfy our strong customer demand. Retail sales on our full-size SUVs have a higher trim mix that earned us more revenue per vehicle. We are committed to growing our strong and profitable fleet business, but we'll continue to balance fleet and retail customer demands with a focus on profitability.\nWe generated healthy cash flow during the quarter, helping support $600 million of year-to-date open market stock repurchases, incremental to the ongoing ASR, retiring another 14 million shares since the beginning of the year. We now have approximately $800 million remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization. In addition, we completed the first tranche of the $10 billion ASR last fall, retiring 4 million shares in Q1. Our fully diluted share count at the end of the quarter was 1.16 billion, down 17% from where we were just one year ago. Given the strong momentum we've seen thus far and our confidence in the 2024 outlook, we are raising full-year guidance to EBIT adjusted in the $12.5 to 14.5 billion dollar range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $9 to 10 dollars range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8.5 to 10.5 billion dollar range.\nNow let's get into the Q1 results. We grew total company revenue by 8% to $43 billion, driven by higher wholesale volumes in North America. Over the last 24 months, we've achieved consistent revenue growth, resulting in a CAGR of more than 15% over that period. We also achieved $3.9 billion in EBIT adjusted, 9.0% EBIT adjusted margins, and $2.62 in EPS diluted adjusted. EBIT adjusted was up year-over-year and well above consensus, driven by our continued strong ICE performance, improving EV profitability, and our strategic cost actions, mitigating the effect of higher labor costs. We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion, up materially versus being flat in Q1 of 2023, driven by improved working capital benefits through inventory management and production timing.\nNorth America delivered Q1 EBIT adjusted margins of 10.6%, driving $3.8 billion of EBIT adjusted, up $300 million year-over-year, primarily from higher wholesale volumes combined with steady pricing and ongoing cost containment. During the quarter, we continued to benefit from our fixed cost reduction program, realizing an incremental $300 million from lower marketing and engineering spend. Our fixed cost base is at its lowest since Q1 2022, and we are on track to achieve the full $2 billion net of depreciation and amortization by the end of 2024. Dealer inventory levels ended the quarter slightly above our 50 to 60-day end-of-year target at 63 days. However, we believe we are well-positioned from an inventory standpoint as we head into a seasonally stronger part of the year and incur a few weeks of planned downtime in Q2 on our full-size pickups to prepare for future launches and to install new equipment.\nGM International Q1 EBIT adjusted was break-even, down $350 million year-over-year. China equity income was a loss of $100 million, down $200 million year-over-year as we lowered production to balance dealer inventory levels. This was slightly better than expected due to a continued focus on cost efficiencies. Having made progress reducing inventory levels, production is normalizing, and we expect a return to profitability in Q2. EBIT adjusted in GM International excluding China equity income was $100 million, down $150 million year-over-year, driven by lower volume in South America, and strategic decisions to protect margins. We anticipate new product launches and further cost efficiencies will help drive profitability improvements beginning in Q2. GM Financial continues to perform well with Q1 EBIT adjusted of $700 million, in line with last year and tracking well within the full-year $2.5 to $3 billion guidance range.\nThey continued to drive portfolio growth and paid a $450 million dividend to GM during the quarter. Cruise expenses were $400 million in the quarter, down from $800 million in Q4 2023, reflecting our cost reduction activities and a more focused operational plan. As Mary mentioned, Cruise is resuming operations in Phoenix, along with testing in simulated environments and on closed courses, while they work to earn trust and build partnerships with regulators and customers. We expect full-year Cruise expenses to be around $1.7 billion. Let's move now to one of the most important metrics we're focused on: EV profitability. We continue to see sequential and year-over-year improvements in variable profit and EBIT margins as we benefit from scale, material cost, and mix improvements. Since last year, we have significantly reduced cell costs, with a large driver being lower battery raw material costs, especially for lithium.\nWe ramped our first battery JV plant last year, and as they increased production and made other efficiencies, the cost of cells came down significantly. Cell plant number two in Tennessee is ramping even faster based on the learnings from plant one and is expected to reach full installed capacity by the end of the year. Collectively, these factors are helping improve vehicle profitability. For example, we have seen more than $12,000 of year-over-year cost savings in the LYRIQ alone. As we continue to ramp, we expect to see the benefits from the production tax credit continue to grow and our fixed cost absorption to improve meaningfully. We wholesaled 22,000 Ultium-based EVs in Q1, up from less than 2,000 in the Q1 of last year, and remain on track to achieve our 200,000 to 300,000 unit production and wholesale volume target for 2024.\nWe will share more on EV profitability as we progress through the year. I would also like to touch on EV pricing, which we recently adjusted on the 2024 Blazer EV. This action has been well received by our dealers and customers, and as Mary mentioned, the vehicle is gaining momentum. We assume some pricing pressure for both ICE and EVs in our business plan and guidance for 2024, but we continue to work on finding additional offsets through cost performance and other efficiencies. Importantly, this pricing action doesn't change our expectation to achieve positive variable profit for our EV portfolio in the second half of the year or our mid-single-digit margin target in 2025.\nWe remain confident that when consumers see our new EVs and get a chance to drive them, they will appreciate the unique combination of design, performance, range, and value that we offer at multiple price points. And because of our supply chain efforts, customers are well positioned to leverage the $7,500 clean energy consumer purchase tax credit. In closing, I want to reiterate our capital allocation framework, along with our intention to be much more consistent in how we deploy capital. We are generating strong cash flow, which is funding our EV transformation and growth opportunities. These efforts include investing in future products, transitioning manufacturing capacity to EVs, and deploying resources into cutting-edge battery technology. At the same time, you've seen us adapt to the dynamic market, particularly for EVs, and made bold decisions to be more efficient with our capital spend, something we will continue to do moving forward.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, and on shareholder returns, we executed the ASR last November, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive, with GM stock outperforming its peers and being up nearly 50% since the announcement. We have seen about a one-turn improvement in our PE multiple since the ASR, but we are still significantly undervalued relative to our historical average, as well as our competitors and other industrial companies. Obviously, we're not satisfied and know that we have a lot of work to do on our valuation and remain committed to improving it. As we move forward, we believe the strong cash generated by our ICE portfolio, along with improved execution on our EV strategy, as well as tangible progress on Cruise, will help generate significant returns for all GM stakeholders. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to analysts, we are asking that you limit your questions to one and a brief follow-up so that we may get to everyone on the call. To ask a question, press star then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star then two. Our first question comes from the line of Joe Spak with UBS. You may proceed.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. First, on the guidance, Paul, I just want to understand the pricing assumption. Is it now just 2% to 2.5% negative for the remaining three quarters? And then you mentioned a couple of things on mix. So you've got higher EV sales, smaller crossovers. Both of those seem like they should continue through the year. And then I think you also mentioned some potential trim headwinds in pickups.\nBut then, on the other hand, you have the EV variable profit turning positive in the second half. So I guess I just want to understand a little bit better how those all intersect, and should we actually see some maybe net improvement in mix as we move through the year?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nGood morning, Joe. You're right that at the end of the day, 2% to 2.5% for the rest of the year is in our assumption. So essentially, what we have done with the guidance is taken the outperformance that we saw in Q1 and built it into the full year. So really, not much has changed on the assumption going forward. So when you look at seasonality and you look at trend lines, keep in mind, in the second half of the year, we've got more EV volume coming in.\nAnd also, we've got some of those pricing headwinds that we've built in. So we feel like this is a good move to go ahead and take it up from where we are. But we're still sort of guided by the same principles as when we put out our initial guidance for the year going forward. So as far as mix goes, we've talked about that a lot. We've obviously been trending fairly strong. We are lapping some price increases that we took last year. So, as I said, the year-over-year comps get a little bit more difficult. But overall, I think the market is holding up fairly well. And as we said before, if we see pricing continuing with this momentum, we expect that we'd be in a position to take up guidance again.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you.\nAs a second question, just on Cruise with the relaunch, I understand the manually operated and mapping, but Mary, you emphasized an improved system. So maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on how much of the existing technology stack is really sort of being leveraged and what's being redone. And then just on the financial side, does the guidance assume any further steps towards that relaunch? And what about a capital need with the cash balance down to $700 million?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nSure. Well, first, Cruise, we're very excited that they're back on the roads in Phoenix. As I said, it is manual, but then we'll progress to supervised and then to unsupervised. And the core tech stack, what we've been doing since we made the decision to pause, is continuing to work and improving it.\nSo we've actually strengthened the safety of the system by continuing to make sure we comprehend, I would say, low probability but higher severity type issues. Because what we recognized in October, although I think mainly it was an issue of not having built the right relationship with the regulatory agencies at all levels, as well as the public, and then being transparent. But we also realized, even though we demonstrated and externally validated that the technology was safer than an average human driver, we need to do more. And so that's what we've been focused on. That's why, as we're going back to Phoenix, we're making sure we're up to date, but very excited about where we are in the technology and very much believe in it.\nFor what we plan to do this year of getting back on the road and demonstrating that the model works in one city, as I've said in the past, and then expanding from there, we believe it's comprehended in the budget that we have. And then, as you look at how we plan to fund the business, we're exploring quite a few options right now, including potentially taking outside investments as well. And so we'll have more to say about that as we move through the year. But I'm very excited to be back on the road. We believe in the technology. We're making it even better. That didn't stop through this whole period since last October.\n\nJoe Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks for the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAutos Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats. Just two questions for me.\nMaybe first for Paul, just can you remind us how we should think about the volume mix of your new and refreshed ICE crossovers the next couple of quarters, and how you're feeling about the prior margin improvement targets that you spoke about at the last quarter? And then maybe for Mary, hopefully, we can kind of go back to the software strategy and maybe talk about some of the goals that we should be expecting for software and the Ultium platform over the next six to 12 months.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Good morning, Itai. Thanks for the question. On our crossovers, we've talked about the new Chevy Trax and Buick Envista, both of which are significantly improved from their prior profitability before the upgrades. And we've seen, particularly, the Chevy Trax really take off. Sales were up 500% in the quarter, and it's really performing well for us.\nSo some of the trends in average transaction prices, I think, are muddied by the fact that the volume on those crossovers are going up considerably, but we've still seen strength in our truck pricing and our SUV pricing as well. So we continue to think that that's a creative and additive to the portfolio, and it's built into our strong guidance that we're updating today.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nAnd then, as it relates to the software strategy, as we move through the year and beyond, first, as Mike stepped back over the past year, though, he did an incredible job of reevaluating and changing our software development process as well as our validation process and brought in an incredibly strong team of probably more than a dozen people at the senior level to really focus on having the right software strategies as we move forward. So I'm very confident.\nWe paused at the beginning of this year with the Blazer, as we saw a limited number of consumers had an issue. We've moved past that now, and that's allowed us to strengthen the software of all of our upcoming vehicles. And so the goals for the next couple of months are to launch with quality on time, and we're on a path to do that. And then, as we go forward, as the new software goes across multiple vehicles, then that gives us an opportunity to focus more on growing subscriptions and services. But I'm very pleased with where we are with the team that we have and the progress they've made, and it's showing in our ability to launch with quality.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAutos Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nTerrific. That's all very helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, everybody.\nMary, I just wanted to ask one strategic question on China. At this point, it's really not a moneymaker for you, and there's a lot of, obviously, noise on a geopolitical basis and sort of our relationship or the US's relationship with China. I'm just curious, is it time to really start thinking about strategic alternatives over there to potentially closing or selling the business? How do you kind of think about that in the context of sort of the broader portfolio over the next few years?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Just in general, with everything that's happened over the last several years with COVID and then with the supply chain issues around the chip shortage and then just broad supply chain issues, we have worked and really strengthened the resiliency of our supply chain, and we'll continue to do that. But over the long term, we're committed to China.\nWe believe that it's a market that, over the medium term, will have substantial growth. We're continuing to draw on not only our global solutions, but in some cases, local solutions as we advance our electrification strategy. Right now, NEVs account for about 30% of GM's total China deliveries from a Q1 perspective, and we're going to build on that through this year because we have an intense NEV launch cadence. From Q2, then moving forward, we have several PHEVs we'll be launching and moving with full EVs as well. So we also have established the Durant Guild, and that allows us to focus on some niche segments in China that are premium and more lifestyle-oriented. And, for instance, the Tahoe and the Yukon will be available for pre-order later this year.\nSo we think, clearly, the market has shifted and the landscape has shifted with the capability of the Chinese OEMs, but we still think there's a role and a place for GM to play with luxury premium and, again, as I mentioned, leveraging not only our global solutions but local solutions. So that is our focus, but we've done that while focusing on supply chain resiliency as well.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. And then I just have one quick follow-up on pricing. Saying 2% to 2.5%, I understand, is your best estimate right now, but calling pricing is difficult. So I was just curious, maybe, Paul, if you could give us sort of a high level of how you think about pricing because there's a lot of cross-currents. I mean, there's EV price cutting, but there seems like there's resilience on the ICE side.\nWhen you look at your CAPU, you're at 100% capacity utilization, which means you're kind of tight on your sort of structural supply. Look at 0- to 6-year-old vehicles. They're going to continue to shrink through the next two years, probably. So the used vehicle market's going to stay relatively tight. So, I mean, I think people are looking at this dealer inventory and saying, \"Hey, things are getting a little bit toppy. There's risk on pricing.\" But when you look at some of the structural aspects of supply, they're reasonably constrained. And it seems like even in the tier two and three supply base, they're constrained on labor. I mean, it just seems like this resilience may be with us a little bit longer than people are fearing.\nI mean, the Colorado and Canyon, as well as your vans, you said you were short on some stuff that you were getting to fleets that you'll catch up later in the year. And there's just all these kind of pockets of shortages that still persist. And it seems like the kind of thing that's going to last for longer than people are fearing. How do you really kind of concoct or come up with that estimate of 2% to 2.5%? And where do you think things will kind of land over the next couple of years?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Well, look, good morning, John. And as we've talked about, the 2% to 2.5%, I want to be very clear, is not an expectation. That's an assumption that we've put into the guidance and provided for people to run their models from that standpoint.\nAs we've seen with the Q1 outperformance, we weren't there. April is actually holding up quite well for us with ATPs actually trending slightly higher than where they did coming out of the quarter. So not really an expectation as much as we've built an assumption in recognizing that there may be some macro headwinds out there. We do know that our comps get tougher as we lap our price increases that we took in the summer of last year. Overall, the commercial environment continues to be resilient. I think this is a very common theme that we've had now for more than a year's worth of quarters, there's a lot of sort of downward bias, but we're continuing to manage commercially month to month and producing in line with demand.\nI think with that balance, it's been very favorable for us on both pricing and margins.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you very much.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, Sam. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Q1 EBIT was strong and annualizing at about $15.5 billion. I think guidance for the full year on EBIT is now $12.5 to 14.5 billion for the year. So I'm hoping to better understand some of the factors that temper EBIT over the balance of the year compared to the Q1 run rate.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Good morning, Mark. So I would say it comes down to a couple of things. One is there's still the assumption in there of the down 2% to 2.5%.\nAnd as we scale up EVs and we continue to make progress about getting them to variable profit positive, the margins on those are not as strong as ICE, obviously. So we see a little bit of pressure in the back half from that, but overall, we'll remain consistent. And as I've said, if we don't see that pricing softness, I would expect that there's an opportunity to outperform these numbers.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's helpful, Paul. Another question on EVs and on the pricing topic. The company spoke to good demand and feedback for its EVs, but the broader market has been quite competitive for EV in terms of pricing.\nI'm hoping to better understand if you think GM is going to need to take additional pricing actions this year to reach the 200,000 to 300,000 outlook that you have in North America, or do the demand signals you have from the market suggest you can hit that kind of volumes this year with relatively firm pricing going forward? Thanks.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nSure. Well, obviously, the early results here as we're ramping up Ultium are pretty strong with retail sales up about 20% year over year, despite the fact that the Bolt, which is sunsetting the prior generation, was down about 60% during the quarter. So retail demand remains strong. We've obviously seen a lot of softness in fleet, particularly on the rental side for EVs, but we see customers responding.\nNow, these are admittedly lower volumes as we scale up, but we're building that momentum that I think we need with the products to be able to show consumers what our capabilities are. When you look at the statistics that Mary cited in the script about the range and what's in our earnings deck, you see that the purpose-built EVs are actually better in terms of performance, range, charging speed, towing capabilities, etc., than many of the other products that are out there on the market. And I think as consumers continue to see that, we'll be well positioned as EV demands at the retail side continue to trend. So we're obviously going to watch it closely, but the early indications are strong.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush. Your line is open.\n\nDan Ives\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wedbush\n\nYeah. Thanks.\nSo, Mary and Paul, does it feel like now with UAW in the rearview mirror, a lot of the EV strategy now coming to fruition, that the company's just in a stronger position, which is less uncertainty? I mean, could you maybe compare today, even six to nine months ago, internally?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nNo. I think you make a really good point, Dan. We do. I feel much better off where we are. As I mentioned, we're ramping up, and the module issue is behind us. All the additional lines that we were scaling are all on track, so we feel very good about that. Obviously, we're pleased that we were able to get an agreement with UAW.\nWe continue to work with them on a number of fronts and build the relationship with the new leadership team as they were named pretty close to when we started negotiations last year. So I feel that we're continuing to talk, raise issues with each other, and problem-solve where we have challenges. So I feel much better about that. And as Paul said, we're seeing good progress with our Ultium-based EVs because they are purpose-built, and they do have customers not making a trade-off. And we also see the charging infrastructure get better every quarter. So I feel very good about where we are, and I think we've got momentum. And believe me, we have a very aligned team across GM that is going to seize all these opportunities. I would also add, Dan, that I feel very good, as I mentioned earlier, about where we are with software.\nThe work and the talent that is in the company now and the progress that we've made gives me confidence we're going to be in a good position there as well. So from last year to now, much better, much more positive.\n\nDan Ives\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wedbush\n\nGreat. Congrats.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector and Head of U.S. Autos Research, BNP Paribas\n\nHi. Good morning, everybody. Just thinking about wholesale growth for the full year, global volumes were up almost 4% in the quarter. Can you help to mention the impact for this current quarter's full-size pickup downtime and just what the first-half or second-half split might look like for the Ultium volumes relative to that 200 to 300 thousand units targeted? Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, let me just comment on full-size pickups.\nWe have announced that we have some down weeks to start installing equipment so we can have a seamless launch as we get to the next model. And we're just going to stay focused on where the customer demand is at. We feel we've got really strong products that, as Paul mentioned, we're growing share. We grew share in the first half with strong pricing, so I think that speaks for the strength of our product. But we're going to be customer demand, and we're going to make sure that we don't overbuild because I think it's important to manage residuals and to make sure that we're managing our inventory. I think that's one of the things that we've done that allows us to continue to be strong with pricing and with our products.\nAs it relates to overall wholesale growth, I don't know, Paul, if you want to talk about that from an EV perspective.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. So on the EV growth, obviously, supply is going to increase throughout the year as we ramp up to the 200,000 to 300,000 units of production that we've talked about. Spring Hill is coming online in Q1, and we're ramping up production pretty steadily, and that's Ultium's cell plant, too. As module production kicks up, we see an exit rate that's significantly greater. Now, of course, we're all going to be paced, we're going to be paced by where the consumer is from that standpoint. Early indications are that the ramp is going well, and we should expect to see that consistently growing throughout the year.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector and Head of U.S. Autos Research, BNP Paribas\n\nGot it.\nAnd then, just to hit on the quarter's China JV losses, is the expectation to see profitability the remainder of the year, or could this take another quarter or two? And then for GMI consolidated, can you just shed any light on the profitability actions that have taken place in South America? Thanks.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Sure. So as China, I think it's progressing as we articulated at the initial guidance range. We did trend slightly better than what we expected, but we foreshadowed the loss in Q1. We do expect that to reverse and be profitable for the rest of the year. And we said results that were similar to slightly down from last year in China. So the rest of the year, we'll have to manage it. But like I said, Q1 was a little bit ahead of expectations, but generally in line, so we'll be profitable.\nFor the rest of GMI, we had some downtime in South America in particular. We're watching Argentina fairly closely as we continue to see the reforms that are going on there. But overall, we see that improving from kind of where we were and not overly concerned about that just yet, but that's a market that we're continuing to watch.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector and Head of U.S. Autos Research, BNP Paribas\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Alex, you may need to unmute your line?\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah. Hi. Can you hear me?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nYes. We can hear you. We got you, Alex.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Very good. So first question on Ultium. You stuck to the 200,000 to 300,000 production guidance, which is good to see. But at the same time, you talk about how you're going to use consumer demand as sort of a gating factor.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nWould you say that the 200 to 300, is that something that you're going to stick to, sort of come hell or high water and then gauge consumer demand from there, or is it something that you could slow walk maybe toward mid-year, toward the second half if it doesn't seem like the consumer demand is materializing?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWe're never going to just build products come hell or high water because the numbers out there. We're always going to be responsive to the customer. But we do believe that we're going to be in that $200,000 to 300,000 range with the number of EVs that we have launching off of Ultium. We're seeing strength with Hummer as we're ramping that up. We're seeing strength with Lyriq, and Blazer is just now ramping up. We've got the Equinox coming, and there's several more.\nSo I think when you look at the fact that these are all going to meet customers exactly with the performance and functionality that they need, we think we're well positioned there. I would also say, though, as you look across our portfolio, we are well positioned, whether it's ICE or EV, with the strength of our ICE portfolio. We're well positioned to respond to the customer. Like I said, we are very focused on making sure that we don't overbuild, that we're able to maintain our price, our margins, and we think we've got the strength. Specifically, if you look at Spring Hill, we can build EV or ICE in that plant. I think we're well positioned. We think we're going to be in that 200,000 to 300,000 range by customer demand, and we'll just continue to adapt.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Perfect, and then second, we talked a little bit about competition within China. I'm interested in hearing sort of your updated views on competition from the Chinese outside China. What's, I guess, GM's stance on this? Do you think protectionism is necessary? Are you more of a free market sort of philosophy from a company standpoint, competing against the Chinese globally, particularly in places like South America? Yeah. Any comments on China? Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. I think it's a great question. And first of all, I think in general, we want to have our best products. And if there's a level playing field, then we want to compete based on products. I think you have to look at where is there a level playing field and what's happening around the world.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nBut there's a lot that can happen from a regulatory or a trade perspective, but we're focused on making sure we have great vehicles at the right price. So what is going to help GM maintain its share around the world? When you look at South America, the Chevy brand is incredibly strong, and we're going to continue to focus on having great designs with great product portfolio, with the right features and functions. And we're constantly working on taking cost out of the system so there's value there as well. And that's the way we're going to compete around the world. But I think the focus has got to be on a level playing field.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nBruno Dossena\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. This is Bruno Ong for Rod. Thanks for taking the question.\nWe'd like to understand the key assumptions you're making in your EV margin outlook for positive contribution margins this year and positive overall margins next year. Based on the hints you've given us, we think you need to improve contribution margins per EV by like $10,000 to $15,000 in 2025 compared to 2023. I think if I heard correctly, that's about in line with what you're seeing on the Lyriq year over year. But if you could just help us understand the key buckets of lower cost and what's driving that and your underlying assumptions around pricing and cost things.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Good morning, Bruno. Thanks for the question. So if you go back to the presentation that we did back in November, we kind of highlighted the roadmap for 60 points of EBIT improvement in 2024, with about 60% of that driven by scale benefits.\nSo if you think about where we are, we've invested a lot into the infrastructure, battery plants, and manufacturing facilities, supply chain, etc., to ramp up production. So some of our EBIT losses are really driven by the fact that we need to grow into what we've built. And so that's about 60% of that 60 points improvement. The rest is really kind of split evenly between trims and launches and also material cost reductions. So we've gotten off to a good start as we've seen battery raw materials start to come into the cell costs this year. We've done a good job of reducing cell costs. And as we said, the Lyriq is down $12,000 in cost year over year. So that's the type of progress that we expect.\nAnd then as we get into 2025, scale becomes a lower driver, and we get into more of material cost reductions in the vehicles that we're producing as they get out of their early years and we start to harness savings in each vehicle line in second, third year of production, etc. So there's a pretty good roadmap there. Pricing, obviously, we're going to continue to watch and see where the market is. As we talked about, what we did on the Blazer was built into our expectations. So we're not changing off of those targets. And we're just a quarter in on the Ultium ramp, but the early indications are positive.\n\nBruno Dossena\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then just stepping back, we wonder if there's multiple paths to the EV losses that are currently being incurred, eventually reversing.\nSpecifically, if the demand or pricing environment for these EVs is softer than expected, how much flexibility do you have to lower costs in the EV business, including as it relates to battery plans? I think your plan is for 160 gigawatt hours, eventually over 2 million units. Is there flexibility to rationalize that if the demand differs from your expectations? Thanks.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nWell, I think you've seen us take steps before. We had a delay in the Orion plant where we've really kind of taken advantage of some of the slowdown to put improvements into that plant that are going to help us lower the costs that came out of some of the early learnings from production at Factory Zero and things that we can do going forward. So I think you're going to see us be very nimble.\nAnd we're trying to build as much flexibility as we can to navigate from here to significantly higher EV adoption going forward. But when you look at our portfolio across both in ICE, it's probably the best portfolio in our history, and customers are responding to that. So we're going to meet the customer where they are and continue to endeavor to exceed their expectations and really reward them for that loyalty that they have to us going forward. And we think that that can translate into the EV market as well. But as Mary said, we're going to continue to be guided by demand for our products and our vehicles. And the early indications are that it's going quite well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director and Global Automotive and Mobility Research, Evercore\n\nThanks so much, team.\nJust wanted to dive into some of the questions on seasonality following some of Mark's questions prior. Paul, could you talk about the seasonality in wholesales? I think you've talked about full year being up sort of mid-single digits, which would imply somewhere in the low to mid-800,000 range for the rest of the year. But if you could just help us with just a little bit of the cadence, given some of the downtime you mentioned in Q2?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors",
    "content2": "Yeah. There was probably a little bit of pull forward from Q1 to Q2, particularly with the trucks as we prep for that downtime and that retooling that's going to happen for a few weeks. But generally, seasonality we expect to be very similar with Q1 and Q4 being slightly lower than Q2 and Q3.\nSo nothing has dramatically changed, but around the edges, maybe a little bit of pull forward from Q2 into Q1. So as we look at the second half, I just want to caution that we've got to continue to be guided by the assumption that's in there on pricing, which obviously has a bigger second-half impact given the performance that we've already booked in Q1 and certainly where April is looking right now. And then with the EV volume ratcheting up in the back half, that's where we see a little bit of front-half loading in the guidance that we've provided.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director and Global Automotive and Mobility Research, Evercore\n\nPerfect. All makes sense. And then maybe just on the actual production side, should we think of sort of truck T1 production as maybe at its height in Q1? Do we get back to this level in Q4, just looking at the overall year and inventory build?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nI think that obviously we're going to continue to watch demand where it is. The inventory, while we built in March, we came out of the quarter about 63 days of inventory across the system. So some of that was intentional knowing that we were going to have this downtime. So once we get through that, I think we could see Q3 production trend a little bit higher, but we're going to be guided by where demand sits.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director and Global Automotive and Mobility Research, Evercore\n\nOkay. Great.\nThanks so much, team.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGood morning. Thanks for all the detail on your planned upcoming EV launches in the US. It does seem likely you will gain share there with the number and attractiveness of the offerings.\nI'm curious if you have a similarly aggressive EV rollout strategy planned for China, including because it seems your share in China has declined amidst the industry transition there to EVs. I heard you citing earlier the increased competitiveness of the domestic Chinese automakers as another contributing factor. There may be still other factors, but would a blitz of new EVs be sufficient, do you think, at this stage to stabilize the share trend in China? Do you have such a blitz planned over the next one to two years? Would that be a pathway to improved financial performance or, given some of the recent pricing trends, represent maybe more of an investment with the payoff some years further out?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah. I think we do have, I think, some strong NEVs coming in China this year. We're repositioning the Buick Velite. We've got the Cadillac Optiq launch coming.\nYou'll see that at the Beijing Auto Show. We also have PHEV entries in the Buick GL8 and the Equinox. For our ICE vehicles, we do also have, for instance, a lead with the GL8, and there'll be more upgrades coming there as well. On SGM, we have new NEV launches as well. So I think we're going to be better positioned, and that's just going to continue as we move through this year into next year. That's why I think we can play in the NEV market, both plug-in hybrids, hybrids, and ICE vehicles, as well as EVs. As I mentioned, with the Durant Guild in the niche segment. So I think there's a place for GM to play in gross share.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks.\nWith all these questions about the new vehicle operations in China, maybe just highlight some of the attractiveness, if it is, that you can draw from the installed base of vehicles there, the OnStar, the financing, sales, service, GM Goodwrench, etc. How do you feel about that element of the China business?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nWell, you mentioned all of the things that come together to allow us to be successful in market, but I would say one of the other things is last year we also established in China a dedicated software and digital business organization, and that is going to allow us to continue to improve and compete on a software basis and also on a services basis, along with what we have from a GMF perspective, financing, as well as OnStar. So we'll continue to build that.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nYeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Paul, just to follow up on that comment on the EV margins. So 60% of the 60 basis points improvements coming from scale benefits. So if BEVs were kind of closer, let's say, to the 200,000 versus the 300,000, is that a net negative or positive to overall margins? Presumably, BEVs come at lower margins, but if you're selling few of them, then there's a negative impact from less scale benefit. So just trying to understand that. How do we think about that volume number impact to the company's margins?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nYeah. Good morning, Tom. What I would say is that, obviously, based on just where we are in the journey, scale matters quite a bit when you've built the infrastructure that we have.\nSo certainly, in the short run, lower volume would have a negative effect on that trajectory. But I think what we're looking at is kind of break even on the variable profit side around low 200,000. So we still are tracking to be able to get that goal. But I look at that as more of a little bit of timing of when we grow into what we've built. And I think from a strategic perspective, growing capacity slightly ahead of adoption to make sure that we can pace and meter ourselves on this journey. Remember, we're playing a 10- or 15-year-plus game from that standpoint. So we've built the flexibility in to be able to respond to ebbs and flows. And we're at a phase right now where we've got to grow into that scale we've built.\nBut those are all really, really sound investments, and we feel good about where that's going to go in the short to intermediate term. Then we're going to continue to watch that going forward.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nThanks. And a quick follow-up on the battery ROS. Obviously, we've seen lithium down something like 80% since the peaks. Just curious how your contracts work. Have we seen the best of that reduction, or is there kind of a lag where you see the best? Is there more benefits to come given the lag in your battery raw mat contracts? Thanks.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nCFO, General Motors\n\nSo what I would say is there's still some goodness to come in 2024. So while we saw battery costs come down, remember, we exited the year with a pretty sizable inventory of cells as we ramp up our module production.\nSo as a result of that, there's still some historical cost in there from last year. But that'll split pretty much, I think, by the time we get to mid-summer. And in the second half of the year, we'll see cells that have much closer to current prices. And then as you look at the kind of vertical integration and investment steps that we made, most of that capacity is in 2026 and beyond. There isn't anything that we've done that I would say we regret because we locked in higher prices, etc. Everything that we've done has been done with a portfolio approach to make sure that we get value for our investment, either through floors and caps, or discounts to market, etc. So we haven't done anything that would have locked in sort of historically high prices.\nThat should be a benefit for us as we roll forward into 2026 and beyond.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra with her closing comments.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThank you. Thanks, everyone, for your question. As we've talked today, we are making extremely good progress across the board. We're driving revenue growth. We've got great margins. Our free cash flow is strong. That's enabling us to reinvest in the business and our employees. We plan to efficiently invest between $10.5 and 11.5 billion in capital this year to leverage the strength of not only our ICE business, but also grow our EV business profitably. We're also advancing our software-defined vehicle capability. I feel very good about the key areas of focus and how we're doing there.\nIn addition, we've set aside more than $160 million in profit sharing for the Q1 to recognize the contributions of the manufacturing team members in the US, which were significant both in terms of production volumes and quality. Our shareholders are also benefiting from the progress too, thanks to our improved execution, a higher dividend, and the value-enhancing benefits of the ASR we launched in November. We are on track to reduce our shares outstanding to fewer than a billion. So I can say to everyone with confidence and conviction that our team is very much on point. We're focused, and we're going to do everything in our power to keep this momentum going. 2024 can be a very strong year for GM. So thank you all for your time. That concludes the conference for today. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect."

During the open remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the open remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We are asking analysts to limit their questions to one and a brief follow-up. To ask a question, press star, then one on your telephone keypad. To join the queue.\nTo withdraw your question, press star, then 2. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, 30 January 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Motors\n\nThank you, Amanda. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's Financial Results for the Q4 and Calendar Year 2023.\nOur conference call materials were issued this. Morning and are available on GM's investor relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO, and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statements on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. With that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2024, I believe GM. Is well positioned for a year of strong financial performance that builds on everything we accomplished and importantly learned in 2023. Consensus is growing that the US economy, the job market, and auto sales will continue to be resilient.\nAt GM, we expect healthy industry sales of about 16 million units. We have an unmatched ICE portfolio in North America, rising EV production on the Ultium platform, and GM Financial continues to perform well. We're building on a foundation of products that our customers love. In 2023, GM sold more vehicles in the US than anyone else.\nAll of our US brands grew their sales year-over-year, and we gained US market share, with healthy margins, thanks to stable pricing and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. The Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV had record sales. We led the industry in initial quality. For the second year in a row according to J.D. Power. We now have led the industry in combined pickup, full-size van, and full-size SUV sales for 10 consecutive years, making us the leader in the highest ATP quadrant of the market and helping us lead the commercial fleet market.\nWe have passed Hyundai and Toyota in the most affordable quadrant, thanks to attractive and profitable vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax, which is one of Car and Driver's 10 Best Trucks and SUVs, and the Buick Envista, which is winning with younger buyers. In fact, more than one in four Envista customers are between the ages of 18 and 35.\nThe broad-based momentum we have today is important for our future because our customers are the most loyal in the industry. All of this success contributed to full year EBIT adjusted of $12.4 billion and adjusted auto free cash flow of $11.7 billion in 2023, which brings our total to more than $22 billion for 2022 and 2023. Almost 2/3 of that cash is being returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in November. Through the ASR, we immediately retired 215 million common shares in Q4.\nOur current share count is less than 1.2 billion and we are working to reduce this even further to less than 1 billion common shares outstanding, which would be about 600 million fewer than at our peak. As we look ahead, our priorities and our commitments are clear. They are to maximize the opportunities we have with our winning ICE portfolio, grow our EV business profitably, deliver strong margins and cash flow, and refocus and relaunch cruise. Across the enterprise, we are taking important steps to deliver on each priority. Let's start with our ICE portfolio.\nChevrolet's Crossover lineup had record sales last year, and this year we're enhancing two of its most important models which compete in growing segments. For example, Super Cruise will be available on the Traverse for the first time. We will introduce a new premium Z71 off-road model. The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox that we unveiled last week is another great example.\nIt has more standard safety equipment, new truck-inspired styling, and a strong focus on technology. And importantly, both the Traverse and Equinox will have higher projected margins than the outgoing model. [Yukon GMC] are also launching new crossovers this year to keep our momentum going. In our EV business, we expect our US portfolio to be variable profit positive in the second half of the year based on our current expectations for EV demand and production growth. Strong interest in our vehicles, lower commodity prices, and other factors will support this. Our plan is to produce and wholesale 200,000 to 300,000 Ultium-based Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, and BrightDrop EVs in North America this year. But we will be guided by customer demand.\nIt's true the pace of EV growth has slowed, which has created some uncertainty. We will build to demand and we are encouraged that many third party forecasts have US EV deliveries rising from about 7% of the industry in 2023 to at least 10% in 2024, which would mean another year of record EV sales. We believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year based on higher production of the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC Hummer EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, and the Silverado EV work truck. We're also excited to have the Chevrolet Equinox EV and the Silverado EV RST, the GMC Denali, the GMC Sierra EV Denali, and the Cadillac Escalade IQ arriving in showrooms over the course of the year.\nWe are confident in the design and performance of these vehicles. For example, the LYRIQ is driving growth at Cadillac. Its sales have increased sequentially every month since September and January deliveries should be in line with December despite winter storms across the country. We also have more than 10,000, excuse me, 100,000 reservations and orders for EV pickups that we expect to fulfill in 2024 and 2025.\nHowever, if demand conditions change. We'll take advantage of our manufacturing flexibility in Spring Hill and Ramos to build more ICE models and fewer EVs. We can also mix between different EV products at Factory Zero. Ultimately, we will follow the customer.\nThe supply chain manufacturing and software changes we have made will support our growth. On the battery front, our Ultium Cells joint venture is at full production in Ohio, and the new plant in Tennessee will begin shipping cells this quarter. In addition, our supply chain team has moved very quickly to resource two minor cell components after the US Treasury published its updated IRA guidelines in December.\nThis change means that new production going forward of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ will qualify for the full $7,500 consumer credit. We work closely with our dealers to ensure consistent pricing for our customers, which we estimate will impact no more than about 25,000 vehicles. Our battery module production is on schedule. The team has improved the automated equipment at our assembly plants used to build modules and installation of new high capacity assembly lines should be complete by mid year.\nOur software and services team is also in the process of resolving the stability issues some customers have experienced issues with the Chevrolet Blazer EV that impacted their screens and charging experience, and they are working with a huge sense of urgency to lift the stop sale soon. We disappointed these customers, and we know it. We are determined to get the software right.\nWe will. We have made several organizational and process improvements that will help us deliver the best possible customer experience going forward. Among several important organizational realignments, we established a software quality division within the software and services team that has been performing a retrospective on the Blazer EV and has improved the current software development and test processes across the enterprise.\nOutcomes of this activity are getting applied to all programs going forward, and they include improved standardization of the software development and release process, increased focus on test automation at the vehicle level, and additional quality gates and metrics for software at the vehicle level.\nFrom a margin and cash flow perspective, we are making good progress on cost reduction and apital efficiency. Compared with 2022, our fixed cost net of depreciation and amortization will be down $2 billion as we exit 2024, which will offset the impact of higher labor costs. We are also beginning to see savings from winning with simplicity.\nAll of our current and future programs have embraced this very important way of designing products. Each team is responsible for creating trim series that make vehicles easy to order, what the content customers want, and far fewer standalone options. By making more equipment standard and trim series with logical price walks, we can eliminate literally thousands of unique part numbers and dozens of software releases.\nFor example, we have eliminated over 1,000 selectable options across our current and near-term product programs, which is reducing hardware, software, ordering, and manufacturing complexity. Importantly, all the costs associated with them. In 2024, the savings are expected to be about $200 million.\nTo be clear, we're talking about $200 million of savings to execute the same product plan. These savings will grow over time as we apply the discipline to future products like our next generation [full size pickups]. We're also continuing to balance capital priorities and consistent free cash flow generation. We expect that our 2024 capital spending will be in the $10.5 to 11.5 billion, which is roughly flat year-over-year, and down considerably from the $13 billion top of our end initial 2023 guidance.\nOur forward plans include bringing our plug in hybrid technology to select vehicles in North America. Let me be clear, GM remains committed to eliminating tailpipe emissions from our light duty vehicles by 2035, in the interim, deploying plug in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure. We are timing the launches to help us comply with the more stringent fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards that are being proposed.\nWe plan to deliver the program in a capital and cost efficient way because the technology is already in production in other markets, we'll have more to share about this down the road. Moving to Cruise. Last week we released the results of the third party reviews, and we've already begun to implement significant changes to build a better Cruise. We are committed to earning back the trust with our regulators and the public through our actions.\nOur planned 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadenced go to market strategy, and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise AVs to the road soon.\nTo summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholder value. You'll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans while meeting our financial targets, our goals are truly aligned with yours.\nBefore I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AB, and software.\nWhen we do get together, we will show you what we've not done, not just tell you what we're going to do. In the meantime, we've already provided a roadmap for EV profitability in 2025, and we'll share updates on Cruise as we finalize the technology and relaunch plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our 2023 financials and provide more details on our 2024 outlook. We'll take your questions.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nThank you, Mary, and good morning everyone. I appreciate you all joining us this morning. I'd like to begin by recognizing the entire GM team for what they accomplished in 2023. When you look back over the last couple of years, the results show an impressive trend in revenue growth, EPS consistency, and cash generation. For the full year, our EBIT-adjusted of $12.4 billion came in slightly above the midpoint of the range we guided to in November. Thanks to the continued strength of the core business, we grew revenue by 10% year-over-year to a record $172 billion, and generated $7.68 of EPS diluted-adjusted.\nA key focus has been profitable growth, and for the full year we demonstrated this by growing US market share by 30 basis points while keeping incentives well below industry averages.\nIt's important to mention the 2023 actions we've taken to reduce fixed costs and the progress made on the $2 billion net cost reduction program. For example, automotive engineering was reduced by $400 million, driven by portfolio simplification. Realizing the benefits from winning with simplicity, as well as our drive to virtual engineering, marketing spend was reduced by $500 million, and we expect another $400 million this year. We saw approximately $500 million from lower BrightDrop and other growth business segments spend, along with the impact of the voluntary separation program across the enterprise. These $1.4 billion of fixed cost reductions were partially offset by $400 million of higher depreciation and amortization.\nMeeting our target to achieve half of the $2 billion program in 2023, we began 2023 with $24 billion of auto cash and marketable securities, generated full year adjusted auto free cash flow of $11.7 billion, and returned approximately $12 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q4. Coming into 2024, we are well positioned with roughly $20 billion of auto cash and marketable securities, and will appropriately balance our capital allocation priorities with the plan to continue to return capital to our shareholder through repurchases and our new, higher dividend rate. Let's get into Q4 results. Total company revenue was $43 billion, consistent year-over-year despite the impact of the strike.\nHowever, we did have a number of cost items that we do not expect to reoccur in 2024 that impacted our margin performance in the quarter. We achieved $1.8 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 4.1% EBIT-adjusted margins, and $1.24 in EPS diluted-adjusted. These results were also impacted by the strike, which had a $900 million EBIT-adjusted impact in Q4 and a $1.1 billion impact for the full year, primarily from losing an estimated 95,000 units of production. Additionally, we increased our inventory valuation allowances by $1.1 billion to remeasure batter cell and EV inventory held at year end. This adjustment was significantly larger in Q4 versus prior quarters, driven by a combination of increasing cell production in preparation for our 2024 EV acceleration and holding more EVs in company inventory. Adjustments for the full year totaled $1.7 billion.\nWe expect this to be substantially lower in 2024 as we continue to make progress toward our EBIT margin targets on EV.\nNorth America delivered Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $2 billion, down $1.6 billion yea-over-year, driven primarily by the $900 million strike impact and $1 billion of inventory adjustments I just discussed. The performance was also driven by higher pricing and lower fixed costs, which more than offset mix headwinds. North America margin of 8.7% was within our targeted 8% to 10% range for the full year and included a 1.6 percentage point impact from the strike and the inventory adjustments. Part of this performance is from proactively managing our inventory levels, helping to minimize incentives. I'm pleased that we ended the year at 50 days of US inventory, which is at the low end of our 50 to 60 day target range, and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average.\nGM International had another solid quarter with Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, which was consistent year-over-year. I want to thank the entire international team for another year of good execution and delivering $1.2 billion of EBITDA-adjusted. GM Financial also performed well with Q4 EBT-adjusted of $700 million, down slightly year-over-year. Full year results were $3 billion at the top end of the $2.5 to 3 billion guidance range. Portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong, in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix, with net charge-offs up slightly due to moderation in credit performance. GM Financial has consistently been an integral part of the business, supporting our customers, supporting our dealers, and paying dividends of $1.8 billion to GM in 2023.\nCruise expenses were $800 million in the quarter, up $300 million year-over-year, and similar to the spend level in Q3. Let's look ahead to 2024. We expect EBIT-adjusted in the $12 to 14 billion range, EPS diluted-adjusted to be in the $8.50 to 9.50 range, including an estimated $1.45 per share benefit from last year's accelerated share repurchase based on the current share price, which will be partially offset by roughly $0.50 headwind from a higher tax rate and lower interest income on lower cash balances, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8 to 10 billion range for the year. I want to summarize a few items in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat and will help to contribute to our higher outlook for this year, despite some of the potential macro headwinds.\nThese include the $800 million EBI-adjusted impact from the LG agreements, and, as a reminder, this will save us an additional $1,000 per vehicle going forward on our path to EV profitability. $1.1 billion EBIT-adjusted impact from the strike, and a substantial amount of the $1.7 billion of net realizable value adjustments as we work through the cell inventory, improve EV profitability, and benefit from lower lithium prices. In light of the current macro environment, we anticipate a market similar to 2023 with total US industry volumes of around 16 million units. We expect wholesale volume to grow as we rebound from the impact of the strike and continue our track record of market share gains primarily from higher EV volume. However, we do assume mix headwinds from our ICE production driven by anticipated actions to proactively manage full-size truck inventory levels.\nWe also assume a 2% to 2.5% pricing headwind year-over-year, but overall we remain confident in our ability to balance production inventory levels and profitability while growing revenues and sustain our North America margins in the 8% to 10% range. We are on track to realize the remaining $1 billion of net fixed cost savings with the benefits coming from similar areas to last year including marketing, engineering, and the full year benefit of the actions we took in 2023. We expect $1.3 billion in higher labor costs along with logistics being a slight headwind yea-over-year primarily driven by higher finished vehicle shipping costs. Cruise expenses are expected to be around $1 billion lower given the new operational plan Mary mentioned earlier.\nIn November we gave an update on our path to EV profitability with an estimated EBIT margin improvement of more than 60 percentage points points, and a lower overall EV loss in 2024 compared to 2023. Even when you exclude the impact of the inventory adjustments, this will largely be driven by higher EV volumes and fixed cost leverage from both EV and battery cell manufacturing, along with the benefit of all of our North America volume being on the Ultium platform. We are already seeing an improvement in cell costs today, driven by significantly lower raw materials prices and better pricing on sales produced at our first battery JV plant from higher capacity utilization. For GM International, we expect relative stability in our South America and Middle East operations. However, we anticipate ongoing pressure in China, including the plan to reduce production in Q1 to balance dealer inventory levels.\nThese actions will likely result in Q1 China equity income being a slight loss, with a return to profitability starting in Q2. For GM Financial, we expect EBT adjusted again in the $2.5 to 3 billion range, with credit performance and used vehicle prices returning to normal throughout the year, along with earning asset growth from retail loan originations and the commercial loan portfolio. We are forecasting another year of robust automotive adjusted free cash flow, but we anticipate modest year-over-year headwinds from 23 working capital benefits that we assume will not repeat and the timing of payments associated with accruals recognized last year, for example, warranty tax and higher assumed inventory levels. From a modeling perspective, remember that Q1 is our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter of the year.\nWe expect our capital spend to be similar to 2023, inclusive of $500 million to $1 billion of investments in our battery JV. Our 2024 effective tax rate is assumed to be in the range of 18% to 20%, up from last year, primarily due to the global mix of earnings and lower R&D credits, primarily due to lower Cruise spend. Our full-year EPS guidance assumes the weighted average fully diluted share count of slightly below 1.15 billion shares. This includes the impact of the remaining shares to be purchased through the ASR, which we expect will reduce our fully diluted share count to below 1.1 billion shares once completed. The actual share count will depend on several factors that impact the final ASR settlement, including the average share price during execution, and excludes the impact of any incremental share repurchases beyond the ASR.\nIn closing, we know the EV market is not going to grow linearly and we are prepared to flex between ICE and EV production given our unique manufacturing capabilities to balance inventory levels and to build customer demand. This will help support pricing and our continued incentive discipline. While we have faced some challenges in our EV transition, we are actively working to address them, remain excited about our future, and look forward to a successful 2024. This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to analysts, we are asking that you limit your question to one and a brief follow up so that we may get to everyone on the call. To ask a question, press star then one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. To withdraw your question, press star then two. Our first question from the line comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAnalyst of Autos Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, everybody, and congratulations. Just a couple questions on the outlook. First, maybe can you share what you're assuming for end-of-year US dealer inventory, day supply? And on the pricing part you mentioned 2% to 2.5%, maybe talk a bit of what you're assuming per individual segments there?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nYeah, good morning Ity, and thanks for your comments and your questions. You know, first on the inventory question, you know, what I would say is we're continuing to pursue our targeted range of 50 to 60 days on hand of inventory. I think the team has done a really good job of balancing that, and I think that's provided some of the ability to be disciplined with incentives and clearly has, I think, resulted in a competitive advantage for us that we've utilized for the last couple of years. As we think about that 2% to 2.5%, you know, similar to what we've done for the last couple of years, I would call that a planning assumption rather than an expectation of where we see pricing.\nYou know, we want to make sure that we do that to make sure to ensure that we can hit our targets, generate the cash flow that's needed for investment, and drive the free cash flow performance. So, as similar to years past, if we don't see that, I would expect that we can get some upside into the numbers that we've talked about. So we haven't gone through and assigned an expectation to any particular categories. That's just something top sided we do in the planning process. I hope that helped.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAnalyst of Autos Equity Research, Citi\n\nIt does help. Thank you. As a quick follow up on the second half target on EV positive VP per unit, can you just talk about what you're assuming for the broader competitive environment and how much cushion you have on the price mix side, and to still be able to hit hose targets?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nSo without getting into very detailed specifics because obviously it can get quite complicated, what I would say is, you know, we feel confident about hitting that variable profit positive target in, probably, the low 200,000 units of the range that Mary mentioned. You know, that's based on a pretty consistent demand profile. So as we've seen the demand for the vehicles that we're producing and the way that customers have received them, we think we can keep that up. So, you know, to the extent that we see any pricing softness or demand retreat, we might have to revisit that. But we feel very good about the trajectory that we're on right now.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAnalyst of Autos Equity Research, Citi\n\nTerrific. That's all very helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\n\nRod Lache\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. Hey, Mary and Paul, I wanted to just first ask, from the outside at least, it looks like there's a lot more scrutiny being applied to capital allocation. I'm thinking about the posture that you're talking about for Cruise and BrightDrop and the adjustments to EV spending. So my question is, just on the surface, it looks like the pendulum has moved a little bit from growth to cash flow. Are these kind of temporary changes or are you kind of thinking about adjustments to GM's strategy?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nHi, Rod. Thanks for your comments. I wouldn't necessarily say change in our strategy. I think as we've continued to progress in the EV transformation, we have found more ways to be much more efficient with capital. And I do want to correct a statement I made earlier where I said we eliminated 1,000 selectable options across our portfolio.\nIt was really 100, although I think I have a new stretch target for the team as we take the initiative global. But it's initiatives like that of continuing to look for ways to optimize the capital. When you look at our ICE portfolio, the investment that we made in the last part of the last decade really sets us up well to have all new products coming off the existing platforms, whether it's full size trucks, full size SUVs, midsize SUVs, et cetera. And so we're looking to continue to be very Focused with capital to make sure it's going to generate the right return.\nI would also say we are prioritizing continuing to return cash to our shareholders as we go through this transformation because we think the strength of our business, especially our ICE business, allows us to do that.\nSo it's not a change in strategy, I would say on some of the business you mentioned, like BrightDrop and others, as we looked at the business, I think what's important is we started them to give them some room. But as we got clarity on where the real opportunity for GM was, we could make those businesses much more efficient. And we're going to continue to do that to work on our cost structure, to make every dollar of capital count.\nBut we still see growth opportunity. We had a revenue growth of 10% last year. So we still have many initiatives in which to grow. We're just going to do it in a very optimized way.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush. Your line is open.\n\nDan Ives\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wedbush\n\nYeah, thanks. So can you just talk about Cruise? What are sort of the targets for this year that we should think about that would just give more confidence that we've turned the corner there? I mean, from an investor perspective, and how you looking at that long term? You are committed to Cruise, right? That's the best what way to think about that once get through some of these situations.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, appreciate the question, Dan. We are committed to Cruise. When we look at the technology, the foundational technology. It's sound. We had already demonstrated and validated externally that Cruise technology is already safer than a human driver. One of the things we've learned is humans expect technology, computers to be much more safe than they, you know, their expectations than they have for other, for other people. And with that knowledge, we are already working on what the level of the technology needs to be to meet the consumer's expectations.\nWe think we can do that. So we are committed, and we are working on the detailed plan right now of how we'll go forward. We're also looking, the other big learning was as you roll out technology that is as transformative as this and has incredible benefits to safety. You have to do it in a way where you're really working with the regulators at the local, state, and federal level, as well as first responders. So as we roll out anywhere, we are going to make sure we build the right relationships. They understand the technology, they understand the benefit of the technology, and that's what we'll do. But we have confidence in the underlying technology. And you'll hear more about our plans for Cruise as we develop the plan in the. Upcoming weeks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJoseph Spak\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning everyone.\nMaybe just back to the EVs, Mary and Paul. I mean you talked about the positive variable profit. It sounds like the LCNRV charge going lower is a big portion of that but you also mentioned some other factors. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail there. And then is this something that you will continually give us on a quarter by quarter basis to sort of track the progress you're making towards that positive variable profit?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nHey Joe, it's Paul. Good morning. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. You know, probably just to digress for a second on the lower of cost or market adjustment on the EV inventory. So a couple of things. Number one, they're not in, that's not in any of the metrics that I think are important.\nClearly it is a yea-over-year benefit for us on our journey. But when you think about the two metrics that we're looking at, there isn't an impact from that. So first is variable profit positive. This relates a lot more to sort of EBIT, how we think about that going forward. But variable profit is mainly benefiting from scale and lower material costs going forward. So not a contributor to that.\nAnd then when you think about getting to the middle single digit margin target in 2025, you know, we would expect that there isn't really going to be inventory that's necessarily carrying that. And if there is, we'll call that out as we go forward. But it's not in our calculations or not a part of what we think our journey is going to be. So I appreciate the question and not surprised by it, but we're continuing to march along. Sorry, the second part of your question was on. Apologies. What was the second part of your question?\nOh, on tracking. Yeah, on when we'll disclose, you know, we'll continue to talk about our journey and give confidence as far as specific data points. Not sure that we're going to do it quarterly yet, but we'll continue to update on our progress. Thanks. I'm sorry for that hiccup.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto and Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Just one question, one follow up. I want to follow up on Rod's question first on strategy. Can you confirm what portion of your four year CapEx and R&D is dedicated to EV battery, AV projects, the Auto 2.0? And any reason to think that this that you may have scope to dial back the vertical integration.\nGiven the changing market. Then my follow-up, and again, I think in the past, Mary, you've talked about well over half—I think you said—in recent years of your spending was on that, but I just wanted to know if that was changing. Then the follow-up was on Elon Musk recently said that in the absence of trade barriers that China will demolish most of the western EV players. Curious your reaction to that comment, whether you'd agree. Thanks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, thanks, Adam. So from a capital perspective and to build on what I said with Rod, the majority of our capital spend is toward EV. Remember from an ICE perspective we have the foundation already built the plants, and as I mentioned, all of the architectures for our really strong ICE portfolio, that capital has already been deployed. So this is really an opportunity for us to just continue to do great vehicles with very optimized capital from an ICE portfolio. As mentioned with the Traverse, the Equinox, and the full-size truck, just to name a few. To your point on capital deployed from an infrastructure perspective, as the market evolves and as battery technology evolves, we will continue to evaluate our level of vertical integration.\nI think with the work we've done on Ultium and the work we've done on electric motors and the joint ventures with plant one, two, and three, and then our fourth plant is with Samsung, that gives us a different form factor with prismatic and cylindrical cells. So I think we're well positioned, but as we move forward we'll evaluate that. So I think there's options there. And as you can see with all the initiatives we have, we are really working to take overall capital down, but still get the number of programs that we need.\nSo, Adam, I hope that helps. Happy, if you have additional questions there. And then on Elon's comments about China, I think, look, I don't discount any competitor. We need to make sure we have beautifully designed vehicles that have the right features, the right safety, and the right customer experience, and we have to do it at a competitive cost base and that's why we're focused so much on our cost base.\nNow when you mention the Chinese consumers, we do need a level playing field. I mean, there comes a point where if it's not a level playing field between tariff and non-tariff barriers, any industry is going to struggle to compete. So give us a level playing field, and I'll put our products and our cost structure that we continue to improve up against any.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto and Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Mary.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Mary, I just wanted to follow up on the strategy line that Adam and Rod have breached here. We're seeing fits and starts in technology.\nIt will eventually get there. At the same time, we are seeing this tectonic shift in competition, particularly coming from China, as Adam alluded to. You've made pronouncements on how the business strategy will be set up for a few years not too long ago. These shifts have been pretty extreme more recently. I'm just curious, as you think about strategy and the position of the company, you haven't been shy about making big changes in the past like exiting Europe.\nCan we think about the potential for real shifts in strategy of focus where the highest margin, highest return is in the business truly five to 10 years down the line, which might include things like exiting China, which sounds like heresy, but might be the best move to make for five years out, maybe rebranding Cruise and really kind of taking a new sort of approach to where the company will land in five to 10 years? To really protect profitability and cash flow from a position of strength instead of maybe a position in five to 10 years where it might be a weaker position.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nHey John, thanks for the question. We continue to evaluate the strategy on a regular basis. We have very robust strategy discussions with our board and with the leadership team. And as you mentioned, the world is changing quickly, whether it's EVs, whether it's software autonomy, et cetera. And we're going to continue to respond to that. I do agree with you that we're doing that from a position of strength and we're going to evaluate where we have the opportunity to deploy capital and generate an appropriate return.\nAnd like we made the decision for China or, excuse me, for Europe, you know, when we looked at that, what we said actually has happened we said it would be a win, win, win, a win for the Opel team, a win for, at the time, PSA, and a win for General Motors because we participated in the warrants, and we did just that. So we're not going to shy away from making tough calls or maybe calls that people wouldn't expect.\nIf we think it's the right thing to do for the business to ensure we're here, we protect our strengths, and in the markets that we have, whether it's North America. I mentioned on the earnings call in the top quartile; we've been leading that for several years, and now we profitably have taken the most affordable segment.\nWe have a strong business in South America and many of our international markets. China, as Paul mentioned, there's tremendous change, not only from a technology point of view, but a competitive point of view. And so we're evaluating China. We think there's a place to play. It is a tremendous growth opportunity if we can do that well, and that's our goal. But nothing is off the table in ensuring that GM has a strong future to generate the right profitability and the right return for our investors.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAnd if I could just sneak one follow-up on the plug in hybrid comment of potentially bringing those here to the US to fill this interim gap. What kind of capacity or volume could you hit there? Here in the US, I know the dealers are clamoring for those vehicles.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, we are going to be bringing those in at a time where we need them from a compliance perspective, this year we're very focused, and I think as we are able to get the delivery to our dealers, they're going to see the strength of the EV portfolio. So I'll have more to share on the hybrid capacity, will adjust the capacity because again we have the technology, we know the targeted segments that we're going to apply it to. So we'll have the ability to flex and do what we need to from a hybrid perspective.\nBut I think for calendar year 2024, EV is our focus and we think we've got tremendous growth opportunity as we free up getting the availability of the products to customers.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. Very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously the 2024 outlook is far stronger than investors expected. How much of the higher outlook versus consensus do you think stems from different industry-related factors that are a matter of debate, such as expectations for volume or pricing in different markets, versus how much do you think stems from company-specific factors that you would naturally have a better handle on internal to the company, such as lower Cruise spending or the potential for more structural cost reduction? The magnitude of guidance leads me to suspect you may be more positive on industry factors, but your pricing comments also seemed pretty in line. So not really sure. How are you thinking about how much of your beating this great guidance in 2024 will come down to factors under your control versus out of your control?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nSo Ryan, thanks for the question. I'll take a shot at that. When you look at the macro backdrop, I think we're approaching it pretty consistently to what we have for the last few years. So we've talked about a 16 million SAR and about 2% to 2.5% of sort of total pricing pressure across the board. A lot of it is, I would say, a testament to what we achieved and overcame in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat. Of course there will be some things that pop up as there are every year and I think the team has done a good job of knocking those things down and overcoming some of those challenges going forward.\nSo against a macro backdrop that feels a little bit consistent with some conservatism in there on the pricing side of it, I think a lot of it is in our ability to execute. And you know, we have had a lot of challenges as Mary mentioned. I think 2023 was a big year of learning for us. But as she talked about with the work that we're doing on the module assembly and where we see EV ramp as well as the customer response to the EVs that we're producing, I think this is a year of our executing and a lot of it is in our control.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, great, thanks. I just wanted to ask on Cruise too, starting with whether the guided $1 billion of lower spending in 2024 versus the 2023 full year $2.7 billion figure or maybe the Q4 run rate of $3.2 billion. And then what is the response been so far? I realize there hasn't been a lot of time passed, but from the regulators to the recently released comprehensive review previously. I think we've guided potentially significantly less spending on Cruise, maybe on the business update call, but then followed a day or two later at Barclays by saying several hundred million; now it's a billion. So of course you were still waiting for the review at that point.\nIs there anything to read into the $1 billion being higher than several hundred million such that maybe the reception of the review could lead to a more prolonged suspension of commercial operations? And then just finally the outlook for the EBIT loss in 2024, whatever it is, $1.7 or 2.2 million. It's greater than the $1.3 billion of cash that Cruise had at year-end right, on, I think slide 26 or so. So just a capital raise, curious any thoughts there?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nSo Ryan, there's a lot in there, but let me start by saying the response from regulators has been positive. So, we'll continue to have that outreach, build that relationship, and be transparent with them. You shouldn't read too much into what we said. Shortly thereafter, we learned of the situation. We went in and did a lot of work. I have to give our co-presidents Craig Glidden and Mo Elshenawy credit for going in and really staying focused on the technology, making sure we keep the very talented software engineers that are doing incredible work and have allowed us to already clock 5 million miles of driverless miles.\nSo it was really just going and looking at a lot of where the opportunity to cut costs came from the change in strategy to really focus on one city to demonstrate it, as opposed to, you remember, at one point they were talking about 20 cities this year. And so there were a lot of people who had been recently added, more from an operational standpoint, that we were able to, to exit those employees. But clearly a focus on the technology.\nAnd the way I look, and this is, we're going to make sure we do it right from a regulatory, a consumer, a customer relationship perspective, get the technology, where we think it would be, and then once we're informed by doing it well in a city, then we'll have the opportunity to go quickly and scale from there. So don't read anything into the billion other than we went and did the work and saw the opportunity.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nLead Automotive Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions on cash. One is you're guiding to $8 to 10 billion of free cash. That pro forma gets your cash balance on the balance sheet to something like $28 to 30 billion at the end of 2024. To what extent are you willing to put forward another share buyback plan beyond what you have if the target is to have cash balance of $20 billion?\nAnd the second question is on Cruise on cash, they're at roughly $1.3 billion I think that gives you a little less than a year of runway on cash. So what's the plan on further funding for Cruise? Thank you.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nSo on the further funding on Cruise, I'll take that and I'll have Paul answer, excuse me, the other question. As we get the detailed plan of how we're going to relaunch Cruise in the roadmap, then we'll evaluate the overall funding needs and we'll determine is it internal or externally sourced.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nAnd Dan, on your question on cash, I think the simple math is correct. We would obviously see a sizable increase in our cash balance. Our capital allocation stance remains the same, which is to invest in the business. And we've talked about $10.5 to 11.5 billion of CapEx this year. We have been streamlining that and making that efficient and a priority to drive free cash flow. And as we look at the balance sheet, I think the balance sheet is in really good shape and there's no change to our stance of call it $18 billion or about $20 billion of cash on hand. So clearly we've demonstrated a renewed commitment and prioritization of returning cash to shareholders and we'll maintain that flexibility going forward.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nJust to clarify, the $18, $20 billion, is that a target or is that a floor?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nThat's kind of been our floor/targeted range, obviously we've carried quite a bit more than that over the last few years as we dealt with some of the uncertainty. But as we imagine, or as we said in November when we announced the share repurchase, with a lot of that uncertainty behind us, lower CapEx spending, we felt comfortable operating at that lower balance. So, 18 to 20 feels very comfortable as a targeted range.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nLead Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Deutsche Bank",
    "content2": "Thank you very much. First of all, I was hoping to ask you about the scale required to achieve the EV profitability goals. So I think when you share those goals back in November, in particular the 60-point EBIT margin improvement this year, I think 60% of that came from scale. I'm curious if the 200,000 to 300,000 units you're planning for this year is that enough to get you that scale piece or are you counting more on lower battery cost and maybe a bit of a shift in terms of some of the savings? And then similar question on the mid-single digits EBIT margin target for next year, I think some of it was going to come from scale. What kind of unit volume do you need to get the scale piece of, you know, to get to these targets?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nGood morning, Emmanuel. Thanks for the questions. You know, on the 2024 numbers, I think they're wholly consistent with the 200,000 to 300,000 range that we've already articulated here. And as I mentioned earlier in response to a question around EVs, you know, the low 200,000 is kind of what gets us to the point where we feel comfortable about getting the variable profit positive from there. Obviously growth is a component, but it's a much smaller component of the walk from 2024 to 2025 than it is from 2023 to 2024.\nBut you know, it'll require some growth. We're not going to commit to that other than just to say, you know, kind of, that's where we stand and we'll see where customer demand is going forward. And on the other point, if I didn't make it earlier, on the lower battery raw material costs, keep in mind that we don't start to see meaningful benefit from that until we get to the middle part of the year. Because a lot of the cells that we have in inventory were built with higher raw materials costs. So while we're producing cells today, we're going first in, first out on the cells.\nSo we have a little bit of a lag before we realize that that lower battery raw material cost of about $4,000 a vehicle that we articulated will also have some annualization benefits in 2025 since we're not getting the full benefit here in 2024. I hope that's helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nLead Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, very helpful. Thank you. One very quick follow up on Cruise. The spending at $1 billion lower for this year. Could that be considered sort of like a new run rate for spending or is it sort of like a temporary situation as a result of some of the pause currently in the testing and rollout?\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nEmmanuel, I would consider it right now. It's our best estimate for this year, obviously, as we develop a much more detailed plan that will inform over the next couple years what the spending needs to be. So more to come.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nLead Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks team. Great numbers. Mary, I just wanted to shift gears and talk maybe advanced [data] and software really quickly. Super Cruise you introduced in 2018, you don't put out too many usage numbers, but I think in the middle of last year you talked about almost 100 million miles cumulatively. Even if we double that for time passage, it's not many vehicles, tens of thousands. We also read Ultra Cruise has now been installed just high level.\nIsn't this a very slow pace for a level two plus product Tesla's been providing for a decade, charging anywhere from $6,000 to 12,000 for top versions? I guess the question is, isn't this becoming a big missed opportunity for GM at this point for additional revenue? Even slide seven, I think, only shows one of the ICE launches, the Traverse highlighting Super Cruise. So, just a broad update when we could start to see what is a technology probably everyone wants at more sort of mass deployment scale across your fleet.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nYeah, Chris, appreciate the question. I think back in the 2018 timeframe, I think we should have, in hindsight, put it across the portfolio much more quickly. It's on a number of models. I don't have it off the top of my head, Ashish, we can provide that, but it's on a number of models across the portfolio right now. As we launch the Traverse this year will be added to the Traverse again.\nWe're seeing extremely strong response from customers where I think it's over 80% to 85% of customers, once they experience the technology, say they would not want a car without it or they would strongly prefer it on their vehicle, which in my experience is a pretty high interest rate for a single technology. So we're committed. We're going to continue to develop, and we have been along the way adding more roads and adding more capability, whether it's lane change, whether it's trailering. So there's a robust plan to continue to improve Super Cruise, and we'll stay on that. And we are seeing the profitability benefits, and the more vehicles, to your point, we get it on, the better it will be.\nAnd we're committed to do that. And frankly have done quite a bit already, and we can provide that.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nNo, that's right. And just in terms of the evolution, the speed, is it a technology bottleneck or is it more just marketing? Meaning you thought of it as a premium product, you charge a sort of a premium rate compared to other GM add-ons? Or is it just like you said, there's a cost to putting it on every vehicle, the [RG&E], so that could increase. But it would obviously be an engineering cost to get it on more vehicles.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nNo, we are committed to get it on as many vehicles possible. In some cases we had planned to make it standard. The semiconductor shortage kind of slowed us down on that because it was a choice of building a vehicle at all or waiting to build it with Super Cruise. So we are very committed to getting it across many vehicles. We've dramatically taken the cost down on the technology. So it's a really good value. And in my opinion we're deploying it as quickly as we can. And it's really just there is engineering required and some sensors required when you add it to a new vehicle. But we're doing that in a very cadenced but as quick as possible fashion.\n\nChris McNally\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat, thanks. So much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst of Global Autos, RBC\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to kind of make sure I got all the, all the good points here on the bridge from 2023 to 2024. Sorry, boring question. You have I guess price down 2% to 2.5%, $200 million cost savings, Cruise down $1 billion, higher labor 1.3. Three items not quantified were market share gains, you guys called out in the slide, EV margin improvement, and the third is lower mix. Just curious if we could get a sense of order of magnitude for those three last buckets.\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nTom, I suggest that we take that offline, work through any modeling details. But at the end of the day. Clearly, the commercial market, as we talked about, we expect to be relatively stable.\nPricing down 2% to 2.5%. Not going to get into the specifics about how we're thinking about market share gains, other than to say fairly consistent about what we've been doing for the last few years going forward, and then on EVs, a lot of that we will continue to talk about as we come to sort of later Investor Day and subsequent calls going forward. I think we've given good detail on the overall walk on a vehicle program level.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst of Global Autos, RBC\n\nOkay, sure. As a quick follow. You know, typically when, you know, if an OEM, let's say, you know, changes production levels, so in this case EV, if you move to plug-in hybrids or what have you, there are monies that get paid to suppliers, right? For that, let's say they have to cut production of EV components. Just curious if those supplier concessions, if you were to, let's say, reduce EV production or shift to plug-in hybrid, are those something that you've envisioned in the 2024 guidance?\n\nPaul Jacobson\n\nEVP and CFO, General Motors\n\nSo, Tom, I think we've got great relationships with our suppliers and a team that works very, very closely with them. They have been, I would say, very patient with us over the last few years because we've had a lot of volatility, and in those situations where we need to help, we've been willing to do that going forward. And we always look at both efficiencies and any challenges in our annual budget process and this year is no different.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst of Global Autos, RBC\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks.\n\nMary Barra\n\nChair and CEO, General Motors\n\nThank you very much and thanks everybody for your questions. I'd like to share just a couple thoughts before we close. Fundamentally, we believe we are well positioned to have a strong year, thanks to our success in high margin and growing ICE segments, our expanding EV portfolio, our cost discipline, and our continuous improvements to design, engineering, supply chain, manufacturing, and marketing process improvements. In addition, we are prioritizing the return of cash to our shareholders on a consistent basis as we execute the plan.\nWe know we must execute in every part of the business in 2024, not just ICE, and I can assure you we will. So, thank you for your continued support and for joining today's call, and please stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 24, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Amanda, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast.\nJoining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language.\nAnd with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChief Executive Officer, General Motors Co.\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the entire GM team for once again delivering very strong results, including $3.6 billion of EBIT adjusted in the third quarter. Our supply chain team and logistics partners in North America have done great work improving the flow of vehicles from our assembly plants to our dealers. Our U.S. dealers have helped us outperform the market from a share standpoint with strong ATPs and essentially flat incentives.\nWe were profitable in every region, including China. And GM International is on track to deliver significantly higher EBIT in 2023 compared to a year ago, thanks to our operating discipline and the lift we're getting from successful vehicles like the Chevrolet Montana and the Trax. I'd also like to recognize our teams in Canada and Korea. They reached new competitive labor agreements and ratified them with little or no disruption to our operations. Because we are in a highly competitive cyclical industry, we have been laser-focused on 4 fundamentals to strengthen our position.\nThey are delivering vehicles that customers love and are willing to pay for, a competitive cost structure, marketing efficiency and incentive discipline and matching production to demand. Driving these fundamentals has been and will continue to be the foundation of our consistently strong earnings. For example, GM has now led the industry in full-size pickup sales for 3 consecutive years, and we have led full-size SUVs for nearly 50 years.\nOur overall incentives have gone from consistently above the industry average to consistently below. And we are on track to exit 2024 with fixed costs that are $2 billion lower net of increased depreciation and amortization than 2022. And we're launching several new SUVs this year and next year that will be more profitable than the models they replace.\nWe're also taking immediate steps to enhance the profitability of our EV portfolio and adjust to slowing near-term growth. These steps include moderating the pace of our EV acceleration in 2024 and 2025 to maintain strong pricing. The new launch timing at Orion Assembly also enables us to make engineering and other changes that will make the trucks more efficient and less expensive to produce and therefore, more profitable.\nLet's dig a little deeper into the steps we're taking with our ICE portfolio to keep margins and EBIT strong during -- in a very competitive environment. Over the last several years, we have bolstered our position in high-margin segments, including full-size pickups, full-size SUVs and large luxury SUVs. We did this by managing capacity to meet demand, expanding the range of premium trim series that we offer and with innovations like Super Cruise in the MultiPro Tailgate and factory lifted trucks. And we're not going to let up. As I said, we're launching a wide range of SUVs that will have automotive gross margins up 5 points higher -- up to 5 points higher than the models they replace. The first 2 are the Chevrolet Trax and Buick and Vista. These affordable small SUVs are rapidly gaining market share and more than 50% of the Chevrolet Trax customers are new to GM.\nThen in the first half of 2024, we began launching the new Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave, followed by the next generation of the ICE, Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, which begin launching midyear. Here are the profit drivers. First, [ fare and ] growth segments. The larger SUVs compete within a segment that we expect to grow by 25% to 3 million units over the next 3 years and the smaller SUVs compete in the industry's largest segment, which we expect to grow 9% to $3.4 million over that same period.\nSecond, they're outstanding products. They offer more comfort and interior roominess, better cargo space, enhanced safety features and innovative technologies, including Super Cruise, which will be a segment exclusive in the [indiscernible]. And third, we develop them efficiently. We have simplified the powertrain lineups where we're using 60% of the parts and reduce build combinations by 80% to 90%.\nNow let's look at EVs. Our commitment to an all-EV future is as strong as ever, and we continue to plan to have annual EV capacity of 1 million units in North America as we exit 2025. This will allow us to participate in the EV market upside but we are also scaling a way that's consistent with the operating discipline I mentioned.\nOver the course of 2023, our battery cell manufacturing joint venture in Ohio has made tremendous progress. The plant will be running at full capacity next month as planned, and they are targeting the production of 36 million cells this year. Next year, production in Ohio is expected to rise to 100 million cells. At the same time, our battery module constraint is getting better, which helps us more -- or helped us more than double the Ultium platform production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And we are now in the process of installing and testing our high-capacity module assembly lines, which will continue into the first part of next year.\nWe are currently challenged getting some of the critical equipment components, but we have a dedicated team working with our suppliers to resolve all issues and get these lines running at rate. By midyear, we expect that modules will no longer be a constraint, and we will be focused on building to customer demand rather than setting new production targets. Software is another critical piece of the strategy, and Mike Abbott and his team are actively engaged in the early assessment in each of these launches. Since he joined our team this summer, Mike has been moving aggressively to build a world-class software organization to fully execute our software-defined vehicle strategy, while accelerating our vision.\nWe now have executives with experience from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Uber and other leading tech companies heading up our human interface design group, our product, software and services group, our software engineering and our software strategy group. These -- the team is optimizing the software strategy and fine-tuning the plans for our new vehicles to help make sure we execute with the highest possible quality and customer experience, while positioning the company to drive significant revenue growth from subscriptions in the future.\nTo give the team time to do this, we'll move out the launches of 3 products: the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Silverado EV RST and the GMC Sierra EV Denali, each by only a few months. This will ensure their success. We believe our products will succeed and the costs are coming out quickly. For example, our cost per cell has already decreased 45% over the last 12 months as production volume in Ohio has ramped up. We also expect to achieve significant margin improvement on our battery electric trucks through engineering efficiency and improvements, supplier cost and reducing order complexity, buildable combinations and manufacturing complexity.\nAnother key launch for us is the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV. I know there has been some speculation in the market as to why we are developing a new Bolt EV. Our strategy is to build on the tremendous equity we have in the brand and to do it as efficiently as possible. Our prior portfolio plans included several newly designed vehicles in the entry-level segments and a capital commitment of $5 billion over the next several years.\nHowever, by leveraging the best attributes of today's Bolt EUV as well as Altium, our latest software and NACS we will deliver an even better driving, charging and ownership experience with a vehicle we know customers love. In the process, we are saving billions in capital and engineering expense delivering a significantly cost improved battery pack using purchased LFP cells. We're getting to market at least 2 years faster, and our unit cost will be substantially lower. This will be our first deployment in North America of LFT technology in the LTM platform.\nSo now let's turn to cruise. Since the early days of our company, GM has been defining the future of transportation and today that's more true than ever with crews. In February, we celebrated cruise becoming the first company to eclipse 1 million driverless miles. Fast forward to today, and they have logged more than 5 million miles, and they continue to expand. Just last week, we announced that GM and Cruise are working with Honda to bring driverless rides to Tokyo in early 2026. We'll do that with our origin, the world's first-ever vehicle purpose-built for autonomous driving on public roads.\nAs Cruise continues to push the boundaries of what EV technology can deliver to society safety is always at the forefront, and this is something they are continuously improving. In fact, it's our 0 crash vision that keeps us pressing forward, and we know from the data that Cruise EVs are involved in far fewer collisions than human drivers. This remains the focus of their ongoing discussions with government partners and regulators at the federal and state levels.\nAnd now let's talk about strikes. We know we have ongoing strikes at some of our U.S. facilities. I know many of you are concerned about the impact of higher labor costs on our business in the U.S. Let me address this head on. I'll start with the macro environment, and then I'll cover how we're positioned to -- positioning the business for success. It's been clear coming out of COVID that the wages and benefits across the U.S. economy would need to increase because of inflation and other factors. This has been playing out in many sectors for some time now. And I believe that the offer we have on the table with the UAW is better than the contracts that employees at companies like Caterpillar, UPS and Kaiser Permanente have ratified. The current offers the most significant that GM has ever proposed to the UAW.\nThe majority of our workforce will make $40.39 per hour or roughly $84,000 a year in salary by the end of this agreement's term. It also includes a cost of living reinstatement, a 25% increase to the company's 401(k) contributions, world-class health care with no out-of-pocket premiums or deductibles for our senior members and enhanced paid time off and several other benefits. Since negotiations started this summer, we've been available to bargain 24/7 on behalf of our represented team members and our company. They've demanded a record contract, and that's exactly what we've offered for weeks now, a historic contract with record wages that have increases that are substantial, record job security and world-class health care.\nIt's an offer that rewards our team members, but it does not put the company and their jobs at risk. Accepting unsustainably high costs that would put our future and the GMT members job at risk is simply something that I will not do. Clearly, given the industry's changing pricing and demand outlook and higher labor costs, we have work to do to ensure we achieve low to mid-single-digit EBIT margins targets that we've laid out for 2025. The work has already begun, and I'm confident we will achieve our target and grow from there. So when you add up all the things we've talked about so far, it should be more clear than ever that we have taken and will continue to take decisive steps to grow our revenue, while sustaining strong 8% to 10% EBIT margins in North America through 2025.\nWe are optimizing both our ICE portfolio and our cost structure to continue to deliver strong profits. We are strengthening our EV business, and then we will accelerate further, and we have assembled a world-class team to deliver new high-margin reoccurring revenue streams from software-defined vehicles. It does remain a truly exciting time for us.\nSo now I'll ask Paul to take you through the third quarter financials in greater detail, and then we'll move to Q&A.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our team members for once again delivering strong results in the face of several challenges. To those employees that continue to build vehicles through the uncertainties of the UAW strike, thank you for your focus your commitment to quality and passion to deliver great products to our customers. In Q3, the UAW strike had a roughly $200 million EBIT impact and so far, in Q4, we estimate the lost production has had an incremental $600 million EBIT impact.\nMoving forward, we estimate that the impact of the UAW strike to be approximately $200 million per week based on the facilities impacted as of yesterday. We're not going to speculate on the duration and the extent of the UAW strike and because of this uncertainty, we have chosen to withdraw our 2023 full year guidance metrics.\nEven though our strong underlying business fundamentals were pushing us towards the upper half of the range prior to any strike impacts. After we have a ratified contract, we will provide an investor update to quantify the final impact of the strike as well as labor costs moving forward. Despite these challenges, we are already working to offset the incremental costs Mary mentioned the great work the team is doing with the net $2 billion fixed cost program announced earlier in the year and the winning with simplicity initiative to drive further efficiencies and cost savings.\nHigher labor costs will make it even more imperative that we continue to focus on the most significant and margin-accretive parts of the business. Let's move now to the Q3 results. Total company revenue was up 5% to more than $44 billion, driven primarily by our consistent pricing and higher wholesale volumes, which were up 2% year-over-year.\nWe achieved $3.6 billion in EBIT adjusted, 8.1% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.28 in EPS diluted adjusted inclusive of the $200 million UAW strike impact during the quarter. Production volumes and pricing were up year-over-year. However, these benefits were more than offset from other parts of the business normalizing, including mix and GM Financial, along with our continued investments in EVs and crews resulting in a $700 million decrease year-over-year.\nAdjusted auto free cash flow was $4.9 billion, up $0.3 billion year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of our core auto operating performance. North America continued to deliver strong results with $3.5 billion in EBIT adjusted. Pricing continued to be robust, and we are starting to see the benefits of our fixed cost reduction program, realizing about $500 million year-over-year savings in Q3 from lower people costs and marketing savings.\nExpected headwinds from pension income, warranty costs and mix along with the impact of the UAW strike more than offset these tailwinds resulting in a $400 million decrease year-over-year. As we shared in our prior quarter's update on warranty costs, the quality of our vehicles continues to be strong, as demonstrated by the decrease in claim rates year-over-year. However, we have experienced an increase in the cost of repairing vehicles due to inflationary factors. We are committed to reducing the number of claims and finding efficiencies to minimize costs and are optimistic that year-over-year warranty headwinds will begin moderating in Q4.\nEBIT adjusted margin was 9.8% and at the top of our 8% to 10% guided target range. In the U.S., we continue to drive profitable market share growth was 0.7 percentage points year-over-year in Q3, growing both retail and fleet share. At the same time, we continued to hold incentive spend consistently low and reduced marketing spend by $200 million year-over-year. We have completely modified our approach to incentives over the last few years. J.D. Power PIN data shows our 2021 U.S. incentive spend as a percentage of ATP, was 1 percentage point above the industry average of 6%.\nIn 2023, we are trending about 0.5 percentage point below the industry average of 3.7%. This $1,500 per vehicle relative performance improvement from 2021 to 2023 equates to more than $3.5 billion in annualized EBIT improvements and is attributable to our strong product portfolio and disciplined inventory strategy. And as Mary mentioned, new and updated products coming in 2024 will have improved profitability, bold designs and new technology to help continue our sales and pricing momentum.\nTotal U.S. inventory has remained within our 50- to 60-day range with a slight sequential increase to 443,000 units at the end of Q3. This is a testament to the hard work of our team who have navigated through the continued logistics challenges and uncertainties related to the UAW strike. GM International had a solid Q3 performance with Q3 EBIT adjusted of $350 million, which was consistent year-over-year. Despite a decrease of $150 million in China equity income, which amounted to $200 million for the quarter, GM International ex-China EBIT adjusted was $150 million, a significant improvement from breakeven in 2022.\nI want to take a moment to thank the entire international team for the work they're doing to deliver profitable results, including the actions in China to help mitigate some of the industry challenges. GM Financial had a strong quarter with an EBT adjusted of $750 million, their fourth highest Q3 ever in spite of higher interest rates and lower used car values. This performance was in line with expectations and primarily due to lower net leased vehicle income. We also saw increased finance charge income associated with portfolio growth and a higher effective yield offset by that increased interest expense.\nCorporate expenses were $300 million in the quarter and consistent with the prior year. Cruise expenses were $700 million in the quarter, and we expect a similar quarterly run rate moving forward as they balance expanding operations with further efficiencies. A larger fleet of AVs and additional resources drove the incremental $200 million of expenses year-over-year. I also want to highlight a few items Mary shared on our retime EV volume and product production decisions. These actions will impact our previous EV production targets, including the 100,000 EV target we had for the second half of 2023 and cumulative 400,000 EVs from 2022 to the first half of 2024.\nWe are not providing new targets, but are moving to a more agile approach to continually evaluate EV demand and adjust production schedules to maximize profitability. We purposely built flexibility into our manufacturing facilities and are uniquely positioned among our competitors to be able to flex our production between ICE and EVs. For example, our Ramos facility builds both ICE and EV variants of the Blazer and the Equinox. Along with Spring Hill, which builds the Cadillac LYRIQ along with existing ICE vehicles. These actions prioritize Ultium profitability versus volume, which helps solidify our North America EBIT-adjusted margin target of 8% to 10% through 2025.\nAnd the cash flows funding our future in EVs, AVs, software-defined vehicles and other new businesses. Given a more agile approach to our EV transition, we now expect to retime at least $1.5 billion of capital spending at our Orion plant, implement engineering improvements and improve EV profitability prior to accelerating production of battery electric trucks. We'll provide more detail around EV profitability once we have clarity on labor costs.\nIn closing, I want to emphasize that our EV momentum is building. We see it in everything from cell production to manufacturing to software. We continue to install significant EV capacity and have the agility and decisiveness to make further adjustments to both accelerate or moderate our transition to adapt to customer preferences. Higher labor costs are at the top of everyone's mind, but will likely be another example of the numerous challenges this team has tackled over the last few years, and I remain confident we'll continue to execute and find solutions to grow EPS moving forward.\nThe cost initiatives we're implementing are not 1 and done, but rather a change in mindset that we expect will drive efficiencies for years to come, fundamentally strengthening the company. This concludes our opening statements, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, July 25, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Amanda, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. .\nJoining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise; Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOn today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language.\nAnd with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChief Executive Officer, General Motors Co.\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Our operating results continue to demonstrate strong growth, thanks to an incredible customer response to our new trucks and SUVs around the world and strong execution of our business planned by the GM team, our dealers and suppliers. Together, we delivered $3.2 billion in EBIT-adjusted in the second quarter, including an $800 million charge for new commercial agreements we have with LG E and LG ES. The charge reflects the conscious decision we made during the Chevrolet Bold EV recall to serve our customers in ways that go beyond traditional remedies, and we're taking new steps that will reduce our costs and improve our margins over time. We'll provide more about EV margin improvement and IRA benefits at the Investor Day in November.\nOur momentum is broad-based. Year-over-year, we have now delivered 4 consecutive quarters of higher retail marketer in the U.S., and our total share was up almost 1 full point in the first half, with strong pricing and incentive discipline. We lead the U.S. industry in both commercial and total fleet deliveries calendar year-to-date. We now have led the U.S. industry in initial quality for the second year in a row. We are focused on strong cost discipline, and we are taking additional steps to lower our capital spending. All of this impacts the bottom line, so we are raising our full year earnings, free cash flow and EPS guidance for the second time this year. We now expect full year EBIT adjusted earnings to be in the range of $12 billion to $14 billion, up $1 billion from our guidance.\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow is now expected to be up $1.5 billion range of $7 billion to $9 billion and EPS is now expected to be in a range of $7.15 to $8.15 per share. The actions we are taking to be more efficient are also having an immediate effect on capital spending. We now expect capital spending in 2023 to be in the $11 billion to $12 billion range, which is about $1 billion less than the high end of our prior guidance, and we're working on more reductions. This guidance assumes that we successfully negotiated new labor agreements without work stoppage.\nOur results and our new guidance underscore the strength of our products today. Last quarter, we talked about new vehicles we're launching to support strong margins. All of them are connecting with customers. At the higher end of the pickup market, the GMC Sierra 84 and Denali models are now 70% of heavy-duty retail sales. Premium models also account for more than 70% of sales for the new GMC Canyon midsize pickup.\nFor the Chevrolet Colorado, our high-performance off-road models, the Z71 Trail Boss and ZR2 represent more than half of retail sales. The new Chevrolet Trax is also off to a very fast start, and it's driving solidly profitable growth. In the U.S., we delivered more than 20,000 trucks in the second quarter, and we expect that to keep growing. Half of these customers are new to General Motors.\nAll of these new vehicles help us deliver more than a $1,600 per unit increase in ATP in the U.S. compared to first quarter with flat incentives and essential inventory. We have the largest ATP increase in the industry by far. The other growth products I highlighted last quarter is the Chevrolet Montana in South America and the Trax Korea also continue to build momentum. The Montana is our first compact pickup for the Brazil market. And in just 4 months, it has earned 1/3 of the segment. We're now expanding distribution to other markets in South America.\nIn Korea, the Trax is an unqualified success, just like it is in the U.S. Pricing is strong and has earned more than 50% of market share in its segment and 2/3 of the customers are new to GM. These hits and the great work the team has done on cost have us on track to deliver significantly higher EBIT adjusted in GM International this year, excluding China equity income.\nLooking ahead, we have several launches in growing segments around the world that will keep our momentum going. In North America, these include the 2024 Chevrolet Traverse, which we rebuild earlier this month. It goes into production in Lansing, Michigan late this year. In the EV market, we achieved our target to produce 50,000 electric vehicles in North America in the first half. About 80% or the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV platform, but the Ultium platform production is increasing. We've had more than 2,000 customer reserve GMC HUMMER, EVs and Cadillac LYRIQs in transit to dealers at the end of June.\nWith both cell and vehicle production increasing, we continue to target production of roughly 100,000 EVs in the second half of the year and will continue to grow from there. Demand for our EVs remains very strong because the Ultium platform is purpose-built for electric vehicles, and it doesn't force customers to compromise on style, performance, utility, range or towing.\nWe have experienced unexpected delays in the ramp because our automation equipment supplier has been struggling with delivery issues that are constraining module assembly capacity. We are working on multiple fronts to put this behind us as quickly as possible and things are already improving. For example, we have deployed teams from GM manufacturing engineering to work on-site with our automation supplier to improve delivery times. We've also added manual module assembly lines, and we're installing more module capacity at our North American EV plants beginning with Factory ZERO and Springhill this summer, Ramos Arizpe in the fall and CAMI in the second quarter of next year. And to address pent-up demand among our HUMMER EV customers, we are planning to increase production by thousands of units.\nIn the meantime, Ultium Cells LLC is delivering great quality and production is ahead of schedule. Looking ahead, the next phase of our EV acceleration is coming into sharper focus. For example, we have now secured more than half of our 2030 direct sourcing target from any critical raw and process materials we need with significant onshoring. During the quarter, this included expansion of our cathode active material joint venture in Canada and an investment to bring manganese sulfate processing to a new facility in Louisiana.\nAs with our recent announcements, these agreements provide us with significant offtake and favorable commercial terms, which is a key component of the EV margin improvement strategy we outlined last quarter.\nNow let's talk about fixed costs. Due to the success of the $2 billion fixed cost reduction plan we announced earlier this year, we have identified another $1 billion in fixed costs that we will deliver over the same 2023 to 2024 time frame. This new action will offset about $1 billion in depreciation and amortization, which means that relative to 2022, our automotive fixed costs will be down $2 billion on a net basis as we exit '24.\nKey components include about $1 billion from the voluntary separation program, another $800 million in reduced sales and marketing expense and the remainder coming from significant reduction in all areas of the business, including engineering expense, travel and administrative costs.\nWe're not done by any stretch. Mark and I have asked Norm Degrave, our new Chief Marketing Officer, to take a fresh review of our spending and put us on a course, to deliver world-class levels of marketing efficiency. Our product teams are also embracing a strategy we call winning with simplicity that will reduce design and engineering expense, supplier cost, order complexity, build up combinations and manufacturing complexity. For example, our teams are applying even greater discipline around our color and trim pallet, the way we package features and options and reuse.\nFor our EV and ICE vehicles, we are targeting a 50% reduction in trim levels through a smart bundling of customer features and options. This results in fewer part numbers to simplify marketing, engineering, manufacturing while maintaining the best features customers want. Yet we are maintaining market coverage for all major segments and price points and the U.S. will compete in ICE and EV segments that represent about 90% of the industry volume in 2030.\nAnd our next-generation full-size pickup and SUVs will show just how powerful winning with simplicity will be. We're investing significantly less capital and expect to deliver vehicles that will have much higher levels of customer-facing content and even better margins than today.\nAnother great example of a capital-efficient program is the next generation of Chevrolet Bolt that we plan to execute. Our customers love today's Bolt. It has been delivering record sales in some of the highest customer satisfaction and loyalty scores in the industry. It's also an important source of Conquest sales for the company and for Chevrolet. More than 70% of customers are new to GM. We will keep the momentum going by delivering a new Bolt that delivers what customers have come to expect, which is great affordability, range and technology. And we will execute it more quickly compared to an all-new program and with significantly lower engineering expense and capital investment by updating the vehicle with Ultium and Ultifi technologies and by a pioneer winning with simplicity discipline. We will have more details to share soon.\nNow before we move to Paul's comments and Q&A, I'd like to invite Kyle to update you on the important steps Cruise has taken to scale its business and make it profitable. So Kyle, over to you.\n\nKyle Vogt\n\nCo-Founder, President, CTO & CEO\n\nThanks, Mary. We are halfway through our first year of rapid scaling, and it's going extremely well. We're on a trajectory that most businesses dream of, which is exponential growth, driven by continuous improvement, engineering innovation and solid product markets. Our formula for driving this growth is quite simple. Number one, we increased the supply of vehicles. Number two, we increased the service availability, so more people can use it. And number three, we make the product awesome.\nSo let's talk about how we're doing on all those and then get into the numbers. On the supply side, we recently had 390 concurrent driverless AVs. We believe this is the largest and fastest-growing AV fleet in the world. Yet you will see several times this within the next 6 months. This is all on the Bolt platform, which we can scale the thousands of AVs, but we're also about to transition to Origins, which are a game changer for costs and are incredible to ride in. And today, I'm pleased to share that our test vehicles are already running in driverless mode on public roads in multiple cities, and we are confident in our regulatory and permitting path despite this being the first time a major OEM has manufactured a vehicle without traditional controls.\nAs a result, we believe we are the only AV company with a well-defined and significantly derisked path to reach billions in revenue. On the second item, availability, we're rapidly expanding cities, hours and service area. As very recently, we now operate a significant portion of our San Francisco fleet 24/7 across the entire city. We've expanded geofences and hours in Austin and Phoenix, and we plan to expand significantly in the next 30 days.\nLastly, we've done the prep work, and we'll launch commercial service in 2 or 3 more cities in the next 12 weeks alone, bringing us to as many as 6 commercial markets with several more following shortly after. All the critical ingredients, things like mapping, ground infrastructure, validation, user acquisition, et cetera, have become several times more efficient as we move from city to city.\nOn the third, being the product awesome. We have over 85,000 5-star reviews in San Francisco alone. People love the product and it gets better every month with each new software update. data from tens of thousands of users across multiple cities, it's clear to us now that demand will greatly exceed supply for several years that gives us margin opportunity and the potential to be ahead of plan on revenue growth.\nNow that is rapid scaling. I'll share a few additional data points before we move on. Cruise cracked 3 million miles, just 49 days after hitting 2 million miles, and the next mile million is going to be even faster. We're now doing over 10,000 rides per week, but more importantly, we're growing rides at 49% per month on average over the last 6 months. 28-day user retention is nearly at the level of a fully matured human ride hill service, and it continues to trend upwards. The product is extremely sticky despite the limitations in hours and service availability that exists today.\nAll of that scaling is occurring while also improving safety and driving down costs. So let's take a look at those. Safety continues to improve despite increasing complexity. Our analysis of the first 1 million miles shows AV's experienced 54 for fewer collisions than human drivers in similar environments and 92% fewer where the AV was the primary contributor. In other words, the vast majority of collisions are caused by inattentive or impaired human drivers, not the AV.\nAnd we expect the gap between human and AV performance to get much wider over the next 12 months. On the cost side, we're seeing ideal trends. Our operational cost per mile traveled has gone down by an average of 15% per month for the last 6 months, led by optimizations in infrastructure, process improvements and automation. Our fixed cost due to machine learning training and simulation are also decreasing over time due to better simulation techniques and investments in efficiency, but most exciting is the step function improvements in cost we will see as our newer vehicles and AV architectures launch. Due to having a much longer service life, the Origin significantly reduces our cost per mile.\nWe also have an optimized sensing and compute architecture in late-stage development that costs about 75% less than what will be on the very first Origins. It's the first time Cruises custom chips will hit the road, which we expect before the end of next year. As our fleet rolls over to this architecture, we'll start to see cost head below $1 per mile, the magic threshold at which robotaxis become cheaper for most people than owning a car.\nLastly, we have something else that's been in the works for a few years that is highly disruptive to the already highly disruptive AV industry. More on that later this year. So putting these things together, it's clear now that Cruise is no longer a science project. There was one significant risk and reasons to doubt but it's now a rapidly growing business with a transformational product in a multitrillion dollar TAM. We've made incredible progress in Q2 over Q1, and I'm excited to continue that momentum in the months ahead. We're truly just being started. Back to you, May.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChief Executive Officer, General Motors Co.\n\nThanks, Kyle, and thanks for sharing the progress that Cruise team is making is just incredible. So before we move into Paul's remarks, I'd like to address our negotiation with the UAW, which just kicked off and with Unifor. First and most importantly, I want to say how proud I am of our talented and experienced manufacturing workforce. There's a direct connection between their hard work and our success, and we have a great future ahead of us. .\nAs we've talked about today, the future includes continued investment in strategic ICE vehicle like the full-size trucks, full-size SUVs and mid-sized SUVs. Our future also includes retooling existing assembly plants and upskilling the team as we transform the company to grow rapidly in EVs. We have a long history of negotiating fair contracts with both unions that reward our employees and support our long-term success of the business.\nOur goal this time will be no different. That's the best possible outcome for all of our employees, plant communities, dealers, suppliers and investors, and we look forward to constructive talks. So thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start by thanking the team for their collaboration on delivering yet another quarter of results and consistently meeting or exceeding our financial targets. At the same time, we are growing the business with 4 consecutive quarters of year-over-year U.S. retail share growth and stable incentive spend. The core auto operating performace continues to fuel the results and fund investments to drive growth in our business with Q2 EBIT-adjusted of $3.2 billion, including the $800 million charge from the LG agreements.\nWe also generated a 7.2% EBIT-adjusted margins including 180 basis point headwind from those LG agreements. Aided by a strong consumer and a robust product portfolio, we are raising guidance for the second time this year, driven by great products, successfully balancing supplier demand and proactive cost management. We have made bold commitments and to achieve them, we are focusing on a solid foundation.\nAs Mary mentioned, we are well along our way to achieving the $2 billion automotive fixed cost reduction. We're also announcing another $1 billion fixed cost reduction to offset higher depreciation amortization from the significant manufacturing investments we've been making in our ICE and EV portfolios. This expands the impact of the plan with the only automotive fixed costs excluded being the lower pension income, a nonoperating noncash items.\nThe product simplification initiatives are expected to have incremental benefits in the years to come as we refresh future ICE products and transition to EVs. We are also taking a capital efficiency to our growth initiatives. For example, we have a profitability driven strategy towards selectively reentering Europe, and we recently announced a collaboration with Tesla to double access to charging for our customers without much incremental investments.\nCumulatively, these factors, along with a reduction in headcount, marketing spend and overhead costs will result in us realizing about $1 billion of year-over-year fixed cost savings in 2023, with most of this benefit coming in the second half of the year. Getting into the Q2 results, Revenue was $44.7 billion, up 25% year-over-year, driven by supply chain improvements and stable pricing. Wholesale volumes year-over-year were up 20% marketing and over 1 year to result in us for a year in and or high end that realizing and overhead. We achieved $3.8 million in EBITDA result in us resulting about $1 million of year-over-year and $1.12. But most of this benefit coming in the company red most of the 100 million year-over-year driven by an improvement the Q2 revenue more important -- we also combined quarter over earlier than the men agreement and state lower pension income. And lower volume in an year were up 20% on over we target has resulted us in a low year of dollar over corneal -- adjusted auto free cash flow was $5.5 billion, up $4.1 billion year-over-year, driven by improved supply chain conditions and higher earnings year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of stock, retiring another 14 million shares, bringing the 2023 total to $865 million and 24 million shares retired. We expect our strong balance sheet and cash flow to support continued share repurchases as part of our capital allocation framework moving forward.\nNorth America delivered Q2 EBIT-adjusted of $3.2 billion, up $900 million year-over-year and EBIT-adjusted margins of 8.6%. The strength of the product portfolio supported market share growth, higher ATPs and again, stable incentives. North America performance was impacted by $700 million of the LG agreement charge, which was a 190 basis point headwind to margin in the segment. We've seen 2 consecutive quarters of warranty-related costs, an area we're monitoring very closely.\nThe fundamental quality of our vehicles remains strong as evidenced by the J.D. Power ratings. However, inflationary factors have increased the cost to repair vehicles. And we've also seen incremental expenses associated with the recent ARC airbag inflator recall.\nTotal U.S. dealer inventory was 428,000 units at quarter end, essentially flat from last quarter. Inventory on dealer lots of our new and most in-demand vehicles continue to run at around 10 days, including our full-size SUVs, the all-new Colorado and Canyon midsize trucks, the Chevrolet Trailblazer and the Chevy Bolt. We are still targeting the end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory, although seasonality, production schedules, and timing of fleet deliveries may test out of this range from time to time.\nSupply chain and logistics challenges are trending in the right direction. However, there are ongoing logistics congestion and industry-wide railcar capacity shortages that we continue to take actions to mitigate. GM International delivered Q2 EBIT adjusted of $250 million, largely flat year-over-year. China equity income was $100 million, up $150 million year-over-year as we lap the COVID shutdowns in Q2 of 2022 and aggressively took actions to help offset industry challenges. I'd like to thank the China team for their tireless efforts and perseverance through multiple years in a challenging environment.\nEBIT-adjusted in GM International in China equity income was $150 million, down $150 million year-over-year, driven by dollar charge from the LG agreements and $150 million mark-to-market gains recorded in the prior year. Absent these items, the results would have been up year-over-year with price increases more than offsetting FX headwinds due to the strength product portfolio, a trend we expect to continue in the second half of the year.\nGM Financial delivered EBIT-adjusted of over $750 million, down close to $350 million year-over-year, in line with expectations and primarily due to a higher cost of funds and lower net leased vehicle income, partially offset by increased finance charge income from portfolio growth and a higher effective yield. GM Financial's key metrics, balance sheet and liquidity remains strong, providing them the ability to support the GM enterprise and our customers across economic cycles. As a result, we are taking our full year EBIT-adjusted guidance up to the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range. Corporate expenses were $350 million in the quarter, down $400 million year-over-year, primarily due to differences in year-over-year mark-to-market changes in the portfolio.\nCruise expenses were $600 million in the quarter, up $50 million year-over-year, driven by an increase in operating spend as they continue to expand operations successfully. As we look forward, due to the strong Q2 core performance and outlook, we are again increasing our full year guidance to EBIT-adjusted in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $7.15 to $8.15 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $7 billion to $9 billion range. Most of the underlying assumptions in our guidance remain unchanged from Q1, with stronger pricing, the main driver behind the increased outlook as we foreshadowed.\nIn addition, we expect better cost performance in commodities and logistics costs to be neutral for the full year. We're bringing the high end of our 2023 capital spend guidance down by $1 billion this year to the $11 billion to $12 billion range in part due to our simplification initiatives. We are evaluating and we'll provide an update on the medium-term capital spend outlook at our Investor Day later in the year, but expect the spend to come down from the previous $11 billion to $13 billion range.\nFor full year adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance, we expect working capital headwinds related to the module assembly challenges Mary mentioned -- offset the benefit from the higher EBIT adjusted lower short-term timing impact result revenue more of cells. But this is expected to unwind as module assembly capacity increases.\nIn closing, we remain very well positioned for the future and achieving our medium and our long-term targets as we've highlighted. We're focusing on profitability, and our recent results demonstrate are not sacrificing margin for volume. We will continue this strategy with the decisions we're making today, helping to drive a fundamentally stronger company beyond 2023. And when you factor in our expected revenue growth, including the opportunities from the software-defined vehicle, AV and other new businesses, this sets us up to grow margin as we get to the back half of the decade. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, April 25, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also join us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language.\nAnd with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChief Executive Officer, General Motors Co.\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Paul, Kyle, Dan and I are glad to have this opportunity to discuss our first quarter results with you. Once again, we delivered strong earnings, and I appreciate the efforts of everyone involved, including the GM team, our dealers, our suppliers, our unions, that all helped us meet strong customer demand for our products.\nHighlights include our international markets outside of China, which had a record quarter, and North America, where we earned 10.9% EBIT-adjusted margins. In the U.S., we are the market leader in retail and fleet sales, including commercial sales. We earned the largest year-over-year increase in U.S. market share of any automaker, and we did it with strong production and inventory discipline as well as consistent pricing.\nWe delivered more than 20,000 EVs in the U.S. in the quarter, on the strength of record Bolt EV and EUV sales and rising Cadillac LYRIQ deliveries. This moves us up to the second market position and increased our EV market share by 800 basis points.\nWe also continue to sell more trucks in the U.S. than anyone by a wide margin. In addition, the $2 billion of fixed cost reductions we are targeting will flow to the bottom line faster than we originally expected. And the enterprise value of these fixed cost reductions will have even greater than $2 billion of value because we're strengthening our culture, which has consistently delivered strong results; we're reducing our executive ranks by more than 15% through voluntary separations, which will help reduce bureaucracy; and we are empowering our leaders to structure their teams to be faster and more agile. In addition, we are prioritizing programs and projects that have the highest revenue and cost impact. We understand the bar continues to be raised, so we're holding ourselves accountable to drive improvements every single day.\nAs we look at the performance of the business and the opportunity ahead of us with new ICE and EV launches, we're able to raise our full year 2023 earnings guidance to a range of $11 billion to $13 billion. The new ICE products we are launching around the world will build on this momentum and support strong mix, pricing and EBIT.\nIn GMI, the new Chevrolet Trax, is off to a very fast start in Korea with more than 13,000 orders placed in the first week of sale. In Brazil, the new Chevrolet Montana pickup saw more than 10,000 orders out of the gate. And demand for our new midsize and heavy-duty pickups in North America is growing, especially at the high end. Over the last years, we've evolved our premium truck offerings from a niche to a franchise. And we did it through manufacturing investments, design, demonstrated capability and technologies like Super Cruise.\nOur customers are responding. 60% of dealer and customer orders for the new Chevrolet Colorado, our high-end Z71, ZR2 and Trail Boss models. Last year, it was 42%. 75% of the GMC Canyon orders are for higher-end AT4 and Denali models. Last year, it was 45%. 52% of Chevrolet Silverado HD orders are for the top-of-the-line high-country model. And 30% of the GMC Sierra heavy-duty orders are for the new Denali Ultimate, which is a brand-new model that didn't exist a year ago.\nOur profitable growth opportunities extend into other segments as well. For example, the Chevrolet Trax and Trailblazer and the Buick Encore GX and Envista will help us win new customers from brands that walked away from affordable vehicles or scaled-back customer choice. All 4 of these small SUVs are beautifully designed, packed with technology and include a long list of standard active safety and driver assistance technologies, yet they all have starting MSRPs below $30,000, with the Trax starting below $25,000. As a measure of just how good these vehicles are, the Trax earned a 63% lease residual. That's 24 points above the previous generation and the best we've ever done in this segment.\nAs for the Envista, one auto writer said its gorgeous styling resembles the Lamborghini and another said, as far as rivals go, the 2024 Envista might be playing in the sandbox alone, because it's both premium and affordable. At the same time, our EV volumes and market share are growing as cell production rises and our teams master new hardware, software and manufacturing technologies that we are deploying.\nAs Paul and I have shared, we plan to produce 400,000 EVs over the course of '22, '23 and the first half of 2024, including 50,000 EVs in North America in the first half of this year and double that in the second half. So far this year, we've built more than 2,000 Cadillac LYRIQs, and production will continue to rise to help us meet pent-up demand.\nBoth GMC HUMMER EV models are shipping from factory zero, and production is scaling. Our production ramp is carefully cadenced as we add additional trim series to the HUMMER EV pickup and began production of EDITION 1 SUV.\nThe team at CAMI has now built more than 500 BrightDrop Zevo 600 vans, and the Zevo 400 begins production in the second half of the year, and we've added Purolator and Ryder as customers. We already have 340 fleet customers for the Silverado EV, and the team at Ramos Arizpe is making great progress preparing for the launches of the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV in the second half of the year. All of this is enabled by rising production at Ultium cells in Ohio, which we expect to reach full capacity at the end of the year. Everything we learned in Ohio will be applied to our next-use Ultium cell plants, including in Tennessee, where we will begin hiring and training production workers in a matter of weeks.\nWork also continues to transform our assembly plant in Orient Township, Michigan to build the GMC Sierra EV and the Chevrolet Silverado EV. We have progressed so far, that it's now time to plan to end the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV production, which will happen at the very end of the year. When Orient EV assembly reopens in 2024 and reaches full production, employment will nearly triple, and we'll have a company-wide capacity to build 600,000 electric trucks annually. We'll need this capacity because our trucks more than measure up to our customers' expectation, and we'll demonstrate that work and EV range are not mutually exclusive terms for Chevrolet and GMC trucks. So stay tuned.\nAs we scale EVs, we will lower fixed costs and will continue to drive margin improvements we outlined at Investor Day. This includes optimizing our pouch cells for energy density, range and cost using new approaches pioneered at our Wallace Battery Center and by our technology partners. And we announced this morning that we're also working with Samsung SDI to add cylindrical and prismatic cells to our portfolio. Having multiple strong cell partners will allow us to expand into new segments more quickly, grow our annual EV assembly capacity in North America significantly above 1 million units and integrate cells directly into battery packs to reduce weight, complexity and cost. Reducing vehicle complexity and expanding the use of shared subsystems between ICE and EV programs is another priority.\nFor example, we are reducing the overall complexity of our software configurations and related hardware on all future ICE and EV products. One important part of our efforts includes the reduction of infotainment screen configurations by 60% across our entire portfolio. By reducing complexity, we can focus on delivering new and improved digital experiences much more quickly.\nWe also expect that our supply chain will be an even bigger competitive advantage starting in '26 and '27, because of the direct investments we've made in lithium, nickel and other commodities as well as CAM, which will allow us to purchase significant quantities of material on favorable commercial terms. All of this is coming together in a way that will fundamentally change the narrative that traditional automakers can't deliver competitive EV margins. We have a lot of work to do, but we have the right trajectory, and I believe we can get there much faster than people think.\nNow before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to invite Kyle to share an update on Cruise, which continues to expand the scale and scope of its operations. Kyle, over to you.\n\nKyle Vogt\n\nCo-Founder, President, CTO & CEO\n\nThanks, Mary. I'd like to give a brief update on our progress. Since last quarter, our driverless fleet has increased by 86% from 130 to 242 concurrently operating AVs. We've completed over 1.5 million driverless miles, and the pace continues to accelerate. Our first million miles took us about 15 months to complete, while the next million miles will likely take less than 3. We're also regularly completing over 1,000 driverless trips with passengers every day, and we're seeing strong retention from our early users. This is significant quarter-over-quarter growth in our services well liked, but we've had limits on when and where it operates. But today, I'm excited to share that right now, a small portion of our fleet is now serving driverless rides 24 hours a day across all of San Francisco. For us, this is a milestone years in the making and represents that our driverless fleet has real commercial value. We're completing the work needed to roll it out to the rest of our driverless fleet as soon as we can.\nAnother key part of rapid scaling is a readily available supply of vehicles. Fortunately, our purpose-built and cost-optimized AV, the Cruise Origin, will be testing in Austin soon. This vehicle has been validated almost entirely in simulation, reducing our historical reliance on expensive and time-consuming supervised test-mile collection. The launch of the Origin is a critical step on our path to profitability as well and towards hitting $1 billion in revenue in 2025. We remain on track and slightly ahead as of today.\nThanks, Mary. Back to you.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChief Executive Officer, General Motors Co.\n\nWell, thanks, Kyle. And now I'm going to turn it over to Paul for a deeper dive into the quarter.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mary, and thank you, Kyle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report a strong start to the year as the team continues to execute on our transformation. We're strategically transitioning the business, while at the same time, leveraging our important ICE portfolio with new and refreshed products, driving continued robust demand for our vehicles while pricing has remained stable.\nWe're also excited to bring on incremental EV volumes, particularly in the second half of the year, as we increase battery cell production at Ultium cells. And as Mary mentioned, we took initial steps in Q1 towards implementing our $2 billion cost initiative, of which we now expect to realize about 50% in 2023, with the majority of this benefit occurring in the back half of the year. The performance-based exits in roughly 5,000 individuals, who participated in the voluntary severance program, will drive approximately $1 billion towards this target.\nBut people cost is just one of several areas we're focusing on. The remaining $1 billion will come from the following initiatives: actions to reduce complexity across the portfolio and throughout the business, in everything we do from vehicle design to engineering and manufacturing. Prioritizing our growth initiatives. We simply cannot do everything. We're focusing on projects like Cruise, BrightDrop and software-defined vehicles, which offer the biggest returns on revenue and margin. And lastly, we're being tactical on overhead and discretionary costs, including corporate travel, IT costs and marketing spend. These actions will have a near-term impact on costs, but we also outlined a number of additional medium- to long-term opportunities at our Investor Day in November last year, which we are aggressively pursuing.\nFor example, we are developing a fully integrated battery ecosystem and taking a portfolio approach to battery raw materials. We will source from a mix of established and early-stage miners, giving us both security of supply and lower pricing volatility. These are meaningful advantages as we scale into the back half of the decade.\nThe Treasury Department's recent guidance on the clean energy consumer purchase incentive also validated our battery supply chain work with our entire fleet of EVs under the MSRP cap qualifying for the full $7,500 incentive this year.\nNow let's discuss another important topic, dealer inventory. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, our plan is to balance supply with demand, and that's exactly what we did this quarter. Early in the year, production improved as supply constraints started to ease and began to outpace still healthy and growing demand. As a result, we proactively planned some downtime, which allowed us to end the quarter with U.S. dealer stock flat compared to December, while we gained 1.3 points of share and increased volumes 4% year-over-year. These production actions were contemplated in our 2023 guidance metrics laid out at the beginning of the year.\nWe are still planning to a 15 million unit SAR and targeting to end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory. Although seasonality, production schedules, and timing of fleet deliveries may take us out of this range from time to time.\nNow let's get into the Q1 results. Revenue was $40 billion, up 11% year-over-year. We achieved $3.8 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 9.5% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.21 in EPS diluted adjusted. Total company results were down only $200 million year-over-year, despite a combined $800 million headwind from lower pension income and lower GM financial earnings, providing more evidence that the underlying business remains quite strong.\nAdjusted auto free cash flow was essentially flat year-over-year, driven by higher capital expenditures related to our EV investments, seasonal working capital headwinds and GM Financial dividend timing. However, we used our strong balance sheet to repurchase $365 million of stock in Q1, retiring 9 million shares and early retiring $1.5 billion in debt maturing later this year. Given the strong Q1 results and our current outlook, we are increasing our full year guidance to EBIT-adjusted in the $11 billion to $13 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $6.35 to $7.35 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion range. I'll provide more details on this after I cover the regional results.\nNorth America delivered Q1 EBIT-adjusted of $3.6 billion, up $400 million year-over-year, and EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.9%. Results were primarily driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by mix, lower pension income, warranty reserve adjustments and higher commodity and logistics costs.\nWe saw a $1.3 billion pricing tailwind year-over-year in the quarter, driven largely by the price increases in 2022 carrying into 2023. We expect this year-over-year pricing benefit to moderate as we progress through the year. However, we anticipate pricing performance on our all-new midsize pickups and refreshed HD pickups to partially offset this headwind.\nDemand for our full-size pickups remain strong, with increased year-over-year total sales of our Silverado and Sierra full-size pickups up 3%. We also gained 0.3 percentage points of total market share to continue our #1 position in full-size pickup sales. Encouragingly, April-to-date performance is also trending well as demand remains healthy, inventory levels are essentially flat, pricing has been consistent, and we're seeing a steady increase in industry volume.\nGM International delivered Q1 EBIT-adjusted of $350 million, largely flat year-over-year, despite the fact that equity income in China was down $150 million due to lower volume and pricing pressure, partially offset by cost actions. The environment in China has been very challenging as the industry navigates continued COVID-related impacts, regulatory changes for both EV and ICE vehicles and greater-than-expected competitive pricing actions. The China team is taking aggressive actions to offset. However, we don't expect an improvement in equity income until the second half of the year.\nEBIT-adjusted in GM International, excluding China equity income, was $250 million, up over $150 million versus last year. The successful turnaround the team has executed over the past few years continued with another record quarter. The results were driven by higher pricing, volume and mix, partially offset by commodity and logistics costs and foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, we expect pricing to be up on a year-over-year basis, leveraging the strength of the portfolio and more than covering FX headwinds.\nFor GM International, we anticipate moderately improved full year 2023 results relative to '22. The strong results and momentum for the rest of GM International are anticipated to more than offset continued headwinds in China.\nGM Financial delivered first quarter EBT adjusted of over $750 million, down $500 million year-over-year, as expected, primarily due to the expected decrease in net leased vehicle income, driven by lower lease sales mix as a result of reduced new vehicle production since Q3 2021 and lower net gains on lease terminations. Also, while higher cost of funds impacted results versus 2022, it was partially offset by higher effective yields on new originations and growth in the loan portfolio.\nGM Financial's key metrics, balance sheet and liquidity remained strong, providing them the ability to support the GM enterprise across economic cycles. We've seen no material impact due to the recent banking crisis. In fact, earlier this month, we were able to renew our $16 billion revolving credit facilities while also receiving a ratings upgrade of GM and GM Financial bonds from Moody's. This upgrade should improve credit spreads on future bond issuances and improve cost of funds as their debt portfolio reprices. GM Financial also paid a $450 million dividend to GM in Q1. Our full year GM Financial expectations of EBT adjusted in the mid-$2 billion range and dividends similar to 2022 have not changed.\nCorporate expenses were $300 million in the quarter, down slightly year-over-year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives.\nCruise expenses were $550 million in the quarter, up $250 million year-over-year, driven by an increase in operating spend as well as by the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense this quarter versus Q1 2022. As we look forward to the rest of the year, our goal is to remain agile and adapt to the dynamic macro environment. Our updated guidance assumes that the pricing benefit we saw in Q1 is neutralized over the rest of the year as we cycle price increases taken in 2022 and incentives gradually increase.\nCommodity and logistics costs have been stickier than originally estimated, primarily due to higher steel prices on market index contracts. For the full year, we now expect commodity and logistic costs to be essentially flat year-over-year versus our prior expectation for a modest tailwind. Our expectation to realize at least $300 million EBIT-adjusted benefit in 2023 from the clean energy production tax credits is unchanged.\nAnd while we continue to experience parts availability and logistics challenges as we did in Q1, we expect these issues to gradually improve over the next few quarters and are, therefore, still expecting 2023 year-over-year wholesale volume to increase 5% to 10%. As Mary mentioned, we are making great progress towards our goal of 1 million units of North America EV capacity in 2025. As we scale and launch multiple high-volume EVs in strategically important segments, we will see the benefits of the Ultium platform expand and help us deliver margins in the low to mid-single digits by 2025.\nIn closing, I also want to say how proud and thankful I am for all of our amazing team members for their tireless efforts. They've executed quarter after quarter and delivered 2 consecutive years of record profits despite many external challenges. Needless to say, my optimism for GM's long-term potential remains very high.\nThis concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.",

(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, January 31, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVP of IR, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2022. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.\nJoining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise; Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclosure on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to begin today's call by recognizing the General Motors team, all of our employees and including our dealers and suppliers. It takes experience, skill and teamwork to adjust to external factors like higher interest rates, commodity price increases and supply chain disruptions and deliver our commitments year in and year out.\nOur team rose to meet every challenge thrown at them in 2022, and they delivered record EBIT adjusted in a year of firsts that really sets us apart from our competition. For example, GM led the U.S. industry in total sales and delivered the largest year-over-year increase in market share of any OEM alongside record ATPs. This reflects the strength of our product portfolio, including our clear leadership in full-size pickups and full-size SUVs, great quality and improved availability. Chevrolet and GMC delivered more than 1.1 million full-size pickups, full-size SUVs and midsized pickups in the U.S., which is about 350,000 units more than our closest competitor.\nOur commercial fleet business is another area of profitable market share. The team has earned the business of more than 300 major commercial accounts over the last several years, which led to our best year for commercial delivery since 2006. The inflection point was driven by our investment in midsize and full-size pickups, including our capacity expansions to build more crew cabs and heavy-duty pickups.\nOur growing portfolio of EVs will enhance our strong sales and share performance across the board because we're targeting the most popular segments at multiple price points. This year, we will have 9 EVs in the market in North America, including the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, which saw record sales. In fact, they were the best-selling mainstream EVs in the second half of the year, and we plan to build more than 70,000 this year for North America and other markets.\nQuality is another area where our team deserves recognition. In the latest J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study, GM improved, while the industry went backwards. Not only did we get better, GM and the Buick brand led the industry, Chevrolet had 6 top ranked vehicles and the Corvette was the highest ranked nameplate in the industry. This commitment to satisfying customers and delivering industry-leading quality helped our eligible U.S. hourly employees earned record profit sharing totaling $500 million, which brings the 3-year total to $1.2 billion.\nLooking ahead, we expect that 2023 will be another strong year for GM. We expect to deliver EBIT adjusted in the range of $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion which reflects operating performance similar to 2022, when you include the normalization of GM Financial's results and pension accounting.\nOur guidance includes a total of $2 billion in cost savings in the automotive business over the next 2 years. The areas we're focusing on include continuing to reduce complexity in all of our products and reducing corporate overhead expenses across the board. I do want to be clear, though, we're not planning layoffs. We are limiting our hiring to only the most strategically important roles and will use attrition to help manage overall head count.\nOn the revenue side of the equation, we expect the new products in key segments will continue to support profitable growth. This includes the Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, our first electric supercar and the quickest production Corvette in history; our new midsized Chevrolet Colorado and GMC pickups; our new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups; and the all-new Chevrolet Trax, which is the best entry-level Chevrolet we ever built.\nWe're especially excited about the Trax and so our dealers in North America, Korea and other international markets. The Trax really stands out in a segment where customers are often forced to sacrifice for a low price. But the Trax is stylish, roomy, packed with safety technology, and it's very affordable. It's combined city highway fuel economy is 30 miles per gallon, and it's also more profitable than the model it replaces.\nThe third-generation Chevrolet Montana pickup that we're launching in South America and Mexico starting next month follows the same formula. The Montana's design is inspired by products like the Blazer and Trailblazer, and it will offer customers more room, the best combination of fuel economy and performance in its segment and a comprehensive suite of safety features and an innovative reconfigurable bed.\nSo let's talk about our growing EV portfolio. At our November Investor Day, we took you deep into the products and supporting strategies that will help us achieve solid EV profitability in 2025. And this is a breakout year for the Ultium platform. Production at our Ultium Cells joint venture in Ohio is on track and the plant in Spring Hill will open later this year. Ultium Cells started hiring and training launch team members in October, and they began equipment installation in November.\nThese plants will help us meet pent-up demand for the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC HUMMER EV pickup and the BrightDrop Zevo 600, and it keeps our other EV launches on track. For example, BrightDrop continues to add new customers, including DHL Canada, and they are on track to achieve the goal of $1 billion in revenue for the year.\nIn April, we launched the Silverado EV Work Truck at Factory ZERO for fleets, so we have opened up the order banks to begin converting initial demand for more than 200 customers into firm orders for 2023 production with the first deliveries in the spring. Interest is so strong that we believe demand will exceed supply in 2023 and into '24.\nIn the fall, we will begin building the sold-out Silverado RST First Edition, Chevrolet's flagship electric pickup, which will feature trailering-capable Super Cruise, 4-wheel steering and a multi-flex midgate and up to 400 miles of range. We'll follow with other retail-focused models in' '24, including the Silverado EV Trail Boss.\nThis summer, we'll also see the launches of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Equinox EV. More than 40% of Blazer's reservation holders are new to EVs. Among the 60% who have owned an EV or hybrid, most are either Tesla customers or are loyal Bolt EV and Volt customers. What's common to everyone is they want an all-electric SUV that's stylish and roomy with enough range and fast-charging capability to make it their daily driver, and they want it from a brand like Chevrolet with a proven record and reputation for quality.\nThe Equinox EV has many of the same attributes in an even more affordable package, which makes it unique and another growth opportunity for GM. More than 1/3 of the customers interested in the Equinox EV say affordability is their key consideration, and the latest data says nearly half live on the East or West Coast or in Texas, which are all growth markets for us.\nThis cadence of cell production and product launches, combined with strong demand for the Bolt EV and EUV keeps us on track to produce 400,000 EVs in North America from 2022 to mid-2024, and with the Ultium platform volumes increasing significantly in the second half of this year.\nOur team in China is also scaling Ultium. The Cadillac LYRIQ, which was the first to launch in September, and our dealers are very excited about it. They delivered around 2,400 units through December with about 80% of customers coming from other manufacturers. Excitement is also building at Buick, which is now building preproduction units of the Buick Electra 5, an SUV inspired by the Electra-X concept. It will be the first in an all-new portfolio of Buick EVs.\nAll of these launches and initiatives will help us deliver near-term commitments we made at Investor Day, and we continue to make bold moves to drive profitable long-term growth. One example is our planned investment of more than $850 million in 4 U.S. plants to build the sixth generation of our small-block V-8, which will deliver even better fuel economy, about a 5% improvement and double-digit reduction in emissions and more performance for our truck and SUV customers.\nWe're also building an EV supply chain that is long-term competitive advantage for GM and a major source of new jobs, especially in North America. For example, our first 3 joint venture cell plants are expected to create 11,000 jobs in the U.S. with about 6,000 in construction and 5,100 in operations. In Quebec, construction of our joint venture cathode active material plant is moving quickly and the structure should be complete midyear. In Texas, MP Materials has started construction of its first rare earth metal alloy and magnet manufacturing facility, and they expect to begin delivering product to us late this year.\nAfter several months of optimizing engineering and process parameters, Controlled Thermal Resources is now recovering lithium from its geothermal brine resource in California's Imperial County. This is an important step in completing the engineering design to recover lithium from geothermal brine at scale.\nIn Australia, Queensland Pacific Metals has secured all major approvals to begin construction of a new facility that will be an environmentally sustainable center for processing nickel and cobalt. In December, Ultium Cells signed a supply agreement with POSCO Chemical to support -- source artificial graphite from Korea.\nAnd today, we announced the largest ever investment by an automaker in battery raw materials. Specifically, we are making an equity investment of up to $650 million in Lithium Americas to help them develop the largest known lithium resource in the U.S. and the third largest globally. Lithium Americas estimates that the potential output from this project could support annual production of up to 1 million EVs and create 1,000 new jobs in construction and another 500 in operations.\nProduction is scheduled to start in the second half of 2026. And after our initial investment, GM will have exclusive access to the lithium offtake in the first phase of the project. It's a landmark transaction, and it certainly won't be the last major supply chain announcement for GM. We continue to pursue strategic supply agreements and partnerships to further secure our long-term needs and drive investment in the United States and across North America.\nAs I said, all of these launches and initiatives tie back to the road map we shared at Investor Day. We're executing a product strategy in ICE and EV that is designed to support strong pricing and grow our share, especially in EVs, by competing in multiple segments and price points. We're expanding domestic cell production to drive EV growth, and we are turning our EV supply chain into a powerful competitive advantage. And we're maintaining strong financial results during a period of high investments, which includes taking a very strategic approach to managing our costs.\nNext, I would like to dedicate a few minutes to Cruise because 2022 was a very significant year for them as well. So Kyle, I'm turning it over to you.\n\nKyle Vogt\n\nCo-Founder, President, CTO & CEO, Cruise LLC\n\nThanks, Mary. Before I share more about the rapid scaling ahead of us for 2023, I'd like to take a minute to highlight what we accomplished in 2022. As you said, last year was the year that fully-driverless AVs transitioned from being a moonshot to reality, with the Cruise taxi fleet serving thousands of rides to real customers in a major U.S. market, and making its first fully-driverless deliveries.\nWe started the year with just a handful of cars on the road and a service that was restricted to employees. In January, though, we welcomed our first public riders and a few months later, launched our commercial service, the first ever in a major U.S. city. And since then, we're approaching 1 million driverless miles, have completed tens of thousands of driverless rides and run the largest driverless AV operation in the world, currently peaking at 130 driverless AVs at the same time in our Redhill fleet.\nWe scaled responsibly, safely and transparently, including the release of the most comprehensive safety report in the industry. It outlines the key tenets and processes we put in practice each day that make our products an obvious choice against a backdrop of tragedies on the road caused by human error.\nWe finished the year delivering on our promise, a bold one, to complete our first commercial driverless rides in Austin and Phoenix. In Austin, we went from 0 footprint to revenue-generating rides in just a few months, and this proves that our technology scales quickly to new regions with minimal modification to our investment. And I think at this point, it's fair to say that our focus on complex cities like San Francisco, doing that first has paid off, and we've opened the door to rapid scaling this year and beyond.\nLooking ahead, this is the year when we really hone in on our key enablers for growth and profitability, with an amazing experience, low cost available everywhere. We're going to expand our service in both existing and new markets, and we'll have more to come on this soon. And we're working to ensure that our riders have an experience that is not only better than traditional ride-hail, but the best transportation experience possible.\nThe Origin will go into volume production later this year with closed course testing underway right now. And I can say after riding in an autonomous Origin myself, I can say that it's going to be hard to go back to the conventional vehicle format for an AV.\nAnd as part of driving down costs and increasing availability, you'll also see us to continue to improve our operational efficiency and scale. And as an example, the most recent 100,000 driverless miles that we did clocked in 8x faster than the first 100,000 miles that we did, and we expect our rapid expansion to continue at similar rates this year and next.\nOur operational efficiency also extends to how we spend our cash. We continually look for creative ways to reduce expenses, including more recently, increasing our use of automation, increasing our cloud compute efficiency and reducing our R&D real estate footprint. Our major investments in lower costs, vehicles and hardware, such as the Cruise Origin, better routing and pricing algorithms and operational efficiencies are going to drop costs and improve our unit economics as we scale to more cities, drive up revenue and continue our march toward profitability.\nWe will be thoughtful and focused with our spending, but we do intend to pursue the massive market opportunity in front of us by significantly increasing our commercial footprint and operating scale. It's abundantly clear that we have a massive opportunity ahead of us, and it's fully within our reach. We will continue to go after it with integrity and with urgency.\nThanks, Mary. Back to you.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nWell, thanks, Kyle. And now let me turn the call over to Paul, who's going to go into a detailed discussion of our results and our outlook.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I also want to start my remarks by thanking the entire GM team. They remain focused on execution and consistently meeting our commitments, no matter the obstacles, and this is exactly what they achieved in 2022.\nWe generated full year revenue of $156.7 billion, representing strong year-over-year growth of 23%. This improvement was driven by the team overcoming numerous logistics challenges and collaborating with the supply chain to increase parts availability. As a result, we grew wholesale volumes 25% within our objective of 25% to 30% for the year. We continue to face some supply chain and logistics issues, but overall, things remain trending in the right direction.\nFor the full year, we achieved $14.5 billion in EBIT adjusted, 9.2% EBIT-adjusted margins and $7.59 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were above the record profits we achieved in 2021 and at the high end of our revised EBIT-adjusted guidance range of $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion as December revenue and FX came in better than expected. They also speak to the robust health of our underlying business, which allowed us to offset $5.5 billion of commodity and logistics headwinds, $2 billion of incremental EV and growth spend and $1 billion lower GM financial results.\nWe generated adjusted free cash flow of $10.5 billion, which allowed us to both reinvest in growth opportunities and return excess cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased an additional $1 billion of stock, bringing the 2022 total to $2.5 billion and retiring 65 million shares. We also opportunistically early retired $1 billion of senior unsecured notes in the U.S. and $0.5 billion of unsecured term loans in GM International, both maturing in 2023. Our goal remains to be responsible stewards of your capital.\nGetting into the fourth quarter results was $43.1 billion, up 28% year-over-year. We achieved $3.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 8.8% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.12 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were driven by solid unit volume growth of 30% year-over-year during the quarter and robust pricing. North America delivered Q4 EBIT adjusted of $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion year-over-year and EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.3%, primarily driven by higher volume and pricing, partially offset by mix and higher commodity and logistics costs.\nProduction in the second half of 2022 increased with strengthening supply chain and logistics, allowing us to improve dealer inventory for certain vehicles. We ended the year with total dealer inventory, including in-transit vehicles running around 50 days, with a number of vehicles physically on dealer lots improving gradually, but still approximately 1/3 of the level we were at in mid-2019, supporting a favorable supply and demand environment.\nI'd also like to share our perspective on inventory levels going forward. We're committed to actively managing production levels to balance supply with demand and are targeting to end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory on a portfolio basis. This is down 20 to 30 days from mid-2019 and is reliant on a continued improvement in logistical challenges the industry has faced.\nWithin this portfolio target, trucks are expected to run at higher levels, reflecting greater customer-driven variation requirements and sedans and SUVs are expected to run at this range or lower. Throughout the year, sales seasonality, production schedules and timing of fleet deliveries may take us out of this range from time to time, but that is the targeted range at which we'll manage.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our EVs, with inventory turning on the Bolt EV and EUV in less than 10 days. The GMC HUMMER EV and Silverado -- Chevrolet Silverado EV have generated incredible demand and excitement, leading to over 250,000 combined reservations. We've also seen strong demand for the Cadillac LYRIQ, GMC Sierra EVs as well.\nOrder books for the model year '23 LYRIQ and Denali Edition 1 Sierra EV were quickly filled with a waitlist that is growing daily. When you add in the interest we've seen for the Equinox EV and the Blazer EV, over 0.25 million hand-raisers, our EV momentum will only build as we enter the largest segments in the world.\nGM International delivered Q4 EBIT adjusted of $300 million, flat year-over-year as the team did an impressive job executing in a volatile environment. This included $200 million of equity income in China, down slightly year-over-year due to lower volume and pricing pressure, partially offset by cost actions. EBIT adjusted in GM International, excluding China equity income was $100 million, up slightly year-over-year and profitable in all 4 quarters. These consistent results were driven by favorable pricing and volume, partially offset by mix in commodity costs.\nI want to take a moment and recognize the transformation this team has executed over the last few years, achieving over $2 billion of EBIT-adjusted improvement since 2018. This was done by exiting unprofitable markets, strengthening the portfolio, leveraging our strong brands to significantly improve pricing and mix, all while simultaneously driving down costs. They've done amazing work as a team, and they should be lauded for that.\nGM Financial delivered strong results with Q4 EBT adjusted of $800 million, down $400 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower net leased vehicle income and higher cost of funds, partially offset by growth in the retail and commercial loan portfolios. Used vehicle prices have declined, but continue to run above the contract residual value with a Q4 off-lease return rate below 10%.\nOverall, portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix, with net charge-offs up slightly due to moderation in credit performance, but still running below pre-pandemic levels. GM Financial paid dividends of $1.7 billion in 2022, and we expect similar dividends in 2023. Corporate expenses were $400 million in the quarter, flat year-over-year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives and drive productivity.\nCruise expenses were $500 million in the quarter, up $200 million year-over-year, driven mainly by modifications to equity awards, resulting in an accounting change in compensation expense. Our optimism continues to grow based on the great progress Cruise made in 2022 and their plans for rapid scaling and operationalizing of the business will result in a modest increase in costs during 2023.\nLet's now look towards 2023 for GM overall, which I know is a key focal point for everyone. While the environment remains uncertain, at a high level, I'm pleased to report that when you exclude the impacts of lower pension income and GM Financial contribution, we expect to drive consistently strong core auto operating performance in 2023. This continues the trend we saw in 2022, and highlights the strong execution throughout the organization.\nOur plan is to continue to prioritize growth initiatives such as Cruise and BrightDrop while investing to accelerate our transition to EVs to take advantage of our vertical integration and local sourcing strategies. Assuming a $15 million total industry volume and under current conditions, we expect EBIT adjusted in the $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $6 to $7 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $5 billion to $7 billion range.\nAt GM Financial, the strong credit performance in historically high used vehicle prices resulted in extraordinary results over the last 2 years. For 2023, we expect earnings to normalize in the mid-$2 billion range. We expect volume and mix combined to be a slight tailwind, with volumes up 5% to 10% year-over-year and mix partially offsetting as we continue to increase production in the sedan, small SUV and crossover segments, along with GM International volume growth.\nRegarding North America pricing. While we anticipate incentives will increase from the record low levels we saw in 2022, we expect this headwind to be partially offset by realizing the full year benefit of MSRP increases on many model year '23 vehicles, particularly full-size SUVs and trucks as well as pricing we expect to achieve on our new launches in '23. We're also anticipating pricing actions outside North America, primarily to help offset FX headwinds.\nOverall, we see commodities and logistics costs as a slight tailwind. Our longer-term steel and logistics contracts, which help protect us from higher market costs over the last 2 years, renewed at higher rates in the second half of last year. This, combined with the strategic initiatives to locally sourced battery raw materials is expected to largely offset the tailwind we're seeing from lower raw material prices on our spot and indexed exposures.\nThe $1 billion lower pension income impacts our fixed costs. This noncash item does not impact our core operating results, but will be a headwind when comparing year-over-year in 2023. As Mary mentioned, we are very focused on keeping automotive controllable fixed costs in check despite our growth initiatives, which is why we are announcing a cost reduction program to take out $2 billion of costs over the next 2 years.\nIncluded in our guidance is the expectation to achieve 30% to 50% of that in 2023 and the remainder in 2024. This initiative is a result of several factors and demonstrates our continued commitment to closely manage our operations through this transformation and achieve North American margins in the 8% to 10% range through 2025.\nWe expect capital spend to be in the $11 billion to $13 billion range, inclusive of $1 billion invested in our Ultium Cells JV. We continue to shift resources to EVs, with around 75% of our product-specific capital dedicated to EVs and AVs. Even with the increase in capital spending, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to remain strong in 2023.\nAs we said back in November, we expect that clean energy tax credits will be a material tailwind for GM over time because of the work we've been doing on vertically integrating the supply chain. For 2023, we anticipate at least $300 million in EBIT-adjusted benefit and expect this tailwind to increase significantly over the next few years as our cell production ramps and our North America focused supply chain comes fully into place.\nWe're closely monitoring the dynamic macro environment as well as customer demand to make sure we're appropriately matching supply with demand. We will take quick and decisive actions on both the supply and the cost side to actively manage the business. What gives us confidence in our 2023 and long-term objectives is the work we've already done to position ourselves for success, repeatedly executing on our commitments and our ability to manage through a very challenging and dynamic environment.\nWith a compelling EV and ICE product portfolio, long-term supply chain commitments, extraordinary manufacturing capabilities, a strong balance sheet and our amazing team, I'm confident we'll continue to enhance the customer experience and deliver compelling growth on both the top and the bottom line. Mary?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nOkay. So with that, I think we're ready to, operator, to start taking your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 25, 2022.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nVP of IR, General Motors Company\n\nThank you, Madison, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.\nJoining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language.\nAnd with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call.\nDuring the third quarter, the GM team once again demonstrated our ability to deliver strong results while executing our growth strategy and managing multiple headwinds. The third quarter brings our EBIT-adjusted earnings for the first 9 months of the year to $10.7 billion, which keeps us on track to deliver our full year guidance.\nWe translated improved supply chain performance into another quarter of full-size pickup and full-size SUV sales leadership with very strong mix and pricing. The Cadillac Escalade also continues to lead its segment by a wide margin.\nChevrolet and GMC unveiled new midsize and heavy-duty pickups to help maintain our strong position when they launch. And the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV are selling at record levels, thanks to their range, technology and value. And in September, they outsold the Ford Mustang Mach-E more than 2:1.\nBrightDrop is generating revenue in the last-mile delivery segment. And later this year, CAMI Assembly is set to launch BrightDrop production, making its candidate's first large-scale EV plant. Production will ramp up in 2023 to begin fulfilling major orders from our customers, including Walmart, FedEx and Merchants Fleet.\nIn addition, BrightDrop launched Trace Grocery eCart last month to help speed up online grocery order fulfillment, with Kroger slated to be the first customer. And as Kyle shared last month, Cruise has begun its expansion into Austin and Phoenix, and he'll share an update in a few minutes.\nSo it has been a great team effort by everyone, and I really want to thank and recognize the GM team, our suppliers and our dealers. While the operating environment remains challenging our team continues to adjust quickly when and where it needs to. This is especially true of our supply chain and manufacturing teams.\nDuring the quarter, we completed and shipped nearly 75% of the unfinished vehicles we held in the company inventory in June. That's well ahead of the plan we shared at our last earnings call. As we've moved through the year, we have seen gradual improvement in the supply chain, including semiconductors.\nShort-term disruptions will continue to happen, but we're taking concrete steps to minimize them and build long-term resiliency. This includes several strategic supply agreements for mature nodes where supply is most constrained. We are also working directly with semiconductor suppliers, ensuring long-term forecasts to increase transparency and ensure their planning cycles include our volume.\nI'd also like to recognize the GM China team. Despite disruptions caused by COVID lockdowns, morale is strong, and the business has returned to profitability, and they are building momentum in China's fast-growing EV market. This includes strong sales of the Wuling Hong Guang Mini EV, which remains China's best-selling electric vehicle; the September launch of the Cadillac LYRIQ; and the debut later this year of the first Buick EUV on the Ultium platform.\nAs we grow EV volumes, we continue to benefit from investments we have made in new ICE products and manufacturing capacity, especially in our truck portfolio, where we are the industry leader. In fact, we took full-size pickup leadership from the Ford F-Series in 2020 and have held it ever since.\nWe'll press our advantage with the new 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD, which will be available in the first half of 2023. The far-ranging improvements to these trucks, including redesigned interiors, enhanced trailering technology and new high-feature models, like the ZR2 for Chevrolet and the Denali Ultimate for GMC, are designed to support continued strong pricing.\nWe are also launching all-new Chevrolet Colorados and GMC Canyons in the first half of 2023, which will include new premium off-road offerings. Importantly, the launches will be accompanied by significant reductions in complexity. For example, we reduced the number of cab and bed configurations from 3 to 1 to focus on the fastest-turning model, and we've also reduced our engine options from 3 to 1.\nGoing forward, all Colorados and Canyons will be powered by the Silverado and Sierra's high-output, 2.7-liter turbo engine, which is a great solution for customers and our business. The new engine offers more horsepower and torque than the outgoing gas powertrains, and we expect a 1- to 2-mile per gallon fuel economy improvement on most models.\nLet's turn next to our EV supply chain and manufacturing base, where we are vertically integrating and scaling. To meet strong demand, we will soon be transitioning production of the Cadillac LYRIQ and GMC HUMMER EV from using imported cells to cells produced at our Ultium Cells joint venture plant in Ohio.\nAt the same time, work is underway for higher production at Factory ZERO as well as volume production at CAMI Assembly in Ramos Arizpe starting in 2023 and Orion assembly in 2024. Construction is also underway on 2 more Ultium cell plants that will open in 2023 and 2024, respectively. This will help us meet strong and growing demand for the GMC HUMMER EV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV and Blazer EV, along with the GMC Sierra EV and BrightDrop vans.\nAll of our 2023 launches are progressing well. However, due to a slightly slower launch of cell and pack production than we expected, our plan is now to produce 400,000 EVs in North America over the course of 2022, '23 and the first half of 2024. We are always gated by quality, and everything we've learned will help us scale more than -- to more than 1 million units of annual capacity in 2025 with even greater confidence.\nFor growth beyond 2025, we continue to secure our future with strategic supply agreements and direct investments in natural resource recovery, processing and recycling. The most recent example is the strategic investment we made in Queensland Pacific Metals of Australia to secure cost-competitive nickel and cobalt. The new clean energy tax credits of the U.S. certainly validate our strategy, and they will be a strong tailwind to expand domestic supply chain capacity and drive EV adoption.\nAs we scale the Ultium platform, we have been very intentional to position the company for volume growth, but with flexibility, efficiency and increased EV profitability over time. This includes fully leveraging the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV. We're planning to increase Bolt production from about 44,000 vehicles in 2022 to 70,000 vehicles next year because demand is at record levels.\nWe will use our industry-leading loyalty to move Bolt customers into one of our new EVs, like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, for their next purchase. Our Bolt EV and EUV owner base should surpass 200,000 at the end of next year. If we retain them at our average customer loyalty rate of 64%, that's more than 100,000 future customers for Ultium platform vehicles. I believe we can do even better because our new EVs are that good.\nAs I've said, customer demand is strong and growing for the LYRIQ, the HUMMER EV, the Silverado EV the Blazer EV. And the early customer and media response to the Equinox EV and the GMC Sierra EV we just unveiled have been overwhelmingly positive. Electric.com wrote that affordability makes the Equinox EV a win for the company and EV buyers everywhere. And MotorTrend said, it could be one of the first vehicles to trigger a tidal wave of EV demand.\nAnd with the Sierra EV, GMC will be the only brand with 3 all-electric trucks in the market. And they are all incredibly distinctive, thanks to the flexibility of the Ultium platform. The Sierra EV Denali's Edition 1, 400 miles of range, 350-kilowatt DC fast charging; 9,500 pounds of towing, bold styling and luxurious refinements make it unlike anything else in the market.\nIn addition, the agreement we struck with Hertz to deliver as many as 175,000 EVs over the next 5 years will build on this momentum. Huge segments of the U.S. population have never driven an EV, and renting one for personal or business travel will be far more immersive than a test drive at a dealer. These customers, as well as experienced EV drivers, will see just how exciting and well-executed our products are, and this can help increase purchase consideration and sales for GM EVs.\nThere have been many other exciting developments this summer and fall, and I'd like to briefly mention 2 that speak directly to the power of our brands and the new business opportunities ahead of us. The first is the Cadillac CELESTIQ that we revealed just days ago. It is a completely bespoke work of automotive art, built around the most advanced and innovative technology we have ever engineered. Media described the CELESTIQ as the most advanced, most luxurious and one of the most important vehicles Cadillac has ever made. But one headline really captured its essence: Cadillac outrolls Rolls Royce.\nThe second is the growth of Super Cruise. Our customers have now traveled 40 million miles with Super Cruise engaged, and the numbers are growing very quickly. We recently doubled its road network to more than 400,000 miles of interstates and non-divided highways, making it even more valuable to customers who already have highly -- are as highly satisfied with the technology. By the end of next year, it will be available on 22 models globally.\nWhile we are expanding the competitive advantage we have in advanced driver assistance systems with Super Cruise, the Cruise team in San Francisco continues to make rapid progress in autonomous vehicles. Kyle is with us, so I'd like to invite him to share an update with you.\n\nKyle Vogt\n\nCo-Founder, President, CTO & CEO, Cruise LLC\n\nThanks, Mary. Overall, we remain largely on track for our goals this year, including expansion in San Francisco and the goal we announced in September to begin commercial driverless operation in 2 new markets.\nWe've now driven well over 400,000 fully driverless miles in San Francisco and given thousands of rides to members of the public, and we expect to expand our service area and hours of operation soon. We believe this is now the largest, fastest-growing and most successful commercial robotaxi service in existence and by a large margin. We've done this while building up a solid track record around safety, especially our safety culture, which drives our decision-making and approach to responsible EV deployment.\nOur product experience is getting better all the time, and we see this reflected in increased adoption and in many rave reviews we receive across both our ride-hail and delivery operations. As you may recall, we plan to do early commercialization in '21 and '22, and we have. Next year marks the beginning of our rapid scaling phase, where we plan to churn through the backlog of users waiting to use our service, ramp up our operations and start to generate meaningful revenue.\nAs for our new markets, Austin and Phoenix, we remain on track to complete our first commercial driverless public rides and deliveries by the end of the year. This will begin at limited scale initially and ramp up as we produce more vehicles. Our current status is that our mapping systems worked as expected, and we've started supervised testing in Austin with more than a dozen vehicles. As we had hoped, we're finding that most of our AV systems generalize well to new markets.\nAnd for the handful of things that are unique to Austin, I've seen donkeys, pedicabs, police on horses, our continuous learning machine is able to automatically mine for these unusual things and then retrain our neural networks to better handle these situations. The same technology is already in use in San Francisco and will be used in all other markets so that our AV system will continuously adapt to changes that occur within that market, such as new kinds of scooters or predominance of HUMMER EVs or however else cities might change.\nAs for the industry, we're seeing increased separation between the company's operating commercial driverless services and those that are still stuck in the trough of disillusionment. What's happening here is that the companies with the best product have pulled ahead and are accelerating. The best talent follows the best products, and those people are what makes a company great. They have a highly vested interest in identifying and moving to the clear winners, and they're good at it.\nThis virtuous cycle fuels the growth of the leaders and stunts the progress of the laggards. And it happens not just with talent, but also with suppliers, partnerships and investors. And you've seen this play out at Cruise with us pulling in timing and expanding scale, which is an anomaly in an industry that is dominated by delayed milestones and missed targets.\nThank you. Back to you, Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Kyle. I appreciate the update and all the work the team is doing at Cruise. So before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to encourage all of you to join our Investor Day on November 17. We plan to use this time to go deeper into the second phase of our EV growth strategy.\nPhase 1 was focused on technology innovation, specifically the development of our proprietary Ultium and Altify platforms. Phase 2 is the rapid scaling of our product portfolio based on Ultium and Altify while leveraging ICE vehicles to maintain strong margins.\nAnd in Phase 3, we'll drive rapid revenue and margin growth across the entire ecosystem through software-defined vehicles, crews and other initiatives to create a flywheel effect. Phase 2 has already begun. And Mark Reuss, Doug Parks, Travis Katz, Paul and I will show you how it accelerates through 2025. We will include KPIs to help you track our EV progress, including margin improvement.\nThen in the first half of 2023, we are playing a deep dive into our software-defined vehicle strategy to show you how we will leverage Altify to help expand revenue and margin. We also plan to share new details about the expansion of Super Cruise, the launch of Ultra Cruise and other high-return technology initiatives. Both events are going to be exciting and compelling.\nWith that said, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Thank you.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us. We've stressed that this year is about executing. In the beginning of the year, we highlighted $5 billion of inflation [throughout the] business, but set out to perform at or near the record levels that we achieved in 2021. Now that we are more than 3 quarters of the way through the year, I'm extremely proud of the progress that our global team has made. We remain well on our way to achieving the commitments we outlined in February.\nVolumes were up 80% year-over-year as we successfully completed and shipped nearly 75% of the vehicles built without certain components held in company inventory at the end of Q2. This tailwind was partially offset by logistical challenges we have seen, particularly from Mexico, which has impacted our ability to recognize revenue on certain in-transit vehicles, along with some spot plant downtime.\nOverall, parts availability and supply chain issues continue to slowly trend in the right direction, with the team working tirelessly to navigate the dynamic environment. As a result, we remain on track to increase full year 2022 wholesales by 25% to 30% year-over-year and deliver North American EBIT margins of 10%.\nQ3 revenue of $41.9 billion was a record for the company. We achieved $4.3 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 10.2% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.25 in EPS-diluted-adjusted. We generated $4.6 billion adjusted auto free cash flow during the quarter and continue to expect $7 billion to $9 billion of cash flow for the full year.\nOur strong cash generation allows us to continue investing in our future while, at the same time, returning cash to shareholders. The confidence in our longer-term outlook informed the Board's decision in August to reinstate our corporate dividend and increase our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. During the quarter, we bought back $1.5 billion of stock, retiring 38 million shares.\nNorth America delivered Q3 EBIT-adjusted of $3.9 billion, up $1.8 billion year-over-year, and EBIT-adjusted margins of 11.2%, primarily driven by higher volume and pricing, partially offset by higher commodity costs as well as investments in growth. Q3 EBIT was positively impacted by the completion of a substantial amount of the vehicles that we built without certain components, which we said last quarter were primarily full-size trucks and SUVs.\nAs production improves, we're closely monitoring dealer stock and inventory turns to appropriately match supply with demand. The number of vehicles physically on dealer lots is well below historical levels and continues to be tight at around 20 days. Importantly, demand remained strong for our highest-margin projects with very fast turn rates. These include HD pickups, like the Sierra, which is turning in about 10 days, and our full-size SUVs are turning even faster.\nTotal dealer stock, including in-transit vehicles, increased due to a combination of higher production, clearing out the portion of company inventory and logistical challenges that have lengthened the [time for] vehicles to arrive at dealers. Pricing in Q3 was favorable versus Q2 and well above Q3 last year. Costs were up year-over-year, primarily due to increased commodity and logistics expenses, engineering, software development costs and the absence of a favorable Bolt recovery in the third quarter last year.\nGM International delivered third quarter EBIT-adjusted of [$300] million, up $100 million year-over-year, as the team continued to navigate a volatile and dynamic environment. This included $300 million of equity income in China, up slightly year-over-year, as production levels have continued to improve from COVID-related impacts earlier in the year.\nEBIT-adjusted in GMI, excluding China equity income, was breakeven, also up slightly year-over-year, with results driven by favorable pricing and volume, partially offset by the same mix and commodity costs. Year-to-date EBIT-adjusted is $400 million, reflecting the tremendous work the team has done over the last several years to strengthen this business.\nGM Financial once again delivered strong results, with Q3 EBIT-adjusted of $900 million, down $200 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower net leased vehicle income. Overall, GM Financial's balance sheet and credit metrics remain healthy, reflecting the strong underlying credit quality of the portfolio. Although moderating off historically strong levels, net charge-offs remain below pre-pandemic levels as credit mix has shifted towards prime customers.\nCorporate expenses were $350 million in the quarter, up $100 million year-over-year, primarily driven by growth initiatives. Corporate also included $100 million gain relating to the disposition of our Stellantis warrants, which we exercised in Q3 when the lockup period expired and resulted in approximately $1.1 billion of cash proceeds. Cruise expenses were $500 million in the quarter, up $200 million year-over-year, driven mainly by modifications to share-based awards, resulting in an accounting change in compensation expense.\nNow let me provide a few forward-looking comments. We continue to track to the midpoint of the $13 billion to $15 billion EBIT-adjusted range we laid out at the beginning of the year. Year-to-date, we're at $10.7 billion EBIT-adjusted, which implies Q4 EBIT-adjusted in the low $3 billion range. Slightly higher wholesale volumes from completing the remaining vehicles held at company inventory are expected to be more than offset by a normalizing mix, launch-related costs and typical seasonality we see in Q4.\nWe estimate commodity and logistics costs to be around $5 billion headwind year-over-year, consistent with prior expectations. Earlier in the year, raw materials were driving around 2/3 of this $5 billion increase. They have come down and are now closer to half, but this benefit has been offset by other costs such as logistics and supplier claims.\nWe're working collaboratively with our suppliers to jointly identify efficiencies to help mitigate these headwinds. As we move into 2023, we continue to see the dynamics between commodities and pricing as a natural hedge that should trend in similar directions, helping to maintain the earnings power of the company.\nWe also continue to see strong demand for our products, and we'll remain thoughtful in our approach to pricing. We've been agile through this volatile environment over the last couple of years. And as we said last quarter, we're already taking proactive steps to manage costs and cash flows, including reducing some discretionary spending and limiting hiring to critical needs and positions that support growth.\nIn summary, we continue to execute on our near-term financial goals. But more importantly, we're making great progress on the milestones we shared last year. And in just a few weeks, we'll have the opportunity to update you at our Investor Day in New York on November 17.\nThis concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, July 26, 2022.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2022. Our conference call materials were issued earlier today and are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.\nJoining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. As you have seen in our press release and other materials, GM delivered $2.3 billion of EBIT-adjusted in the second quarter, which is in line with the update we shared on July 1. We also remain on track to deliver our full year guidance, which includes EBIT-adjusted of between $13 billion and $15 billion. This is a truly unique and dynamic market that presents both challenges and opportunities for GM.\nOverall, GM production continues to improve year-over-year despite some short-term challenges, and we are on track to increase our wholesales by 25% to 30%, in line with our expectations for the year. This has helped us extend our U.S. truck leadership, where demand is the strongest and supplies are well below optimal.\nThe Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra led the industry in total full-size pickup sales in 2020 and in 2021. We continue to lead in 2022 by a wide margin. In fact, our retail market share in the first half is up 2 percentage points to 40%.\nBut even as we operate our truck plants at near full capacity, our inventory has remained extremely low due to continued strong demand. The stock on the ground for GM full-size pickups has been in the mid-teens in terms of days supply for more than 90 days. For full-size SUVs, it's below 10. This helps explain why we continued building trucks in June even though we couldn't ship everything right away due to supply chain issues. The facts are the customers are there for our vehicles. They've been waiting, and all indications are they remain ready to buy.\nWhile demand remains strong, there are growing concerns about the economy to be sure. That's why we're already taking proactive steps to manage costs and cash flows, including reducing some discretionary spending and limiting hiring to critical needs and positions that support growth. In addition, we have modeled several downturn scenarios, and we are prepared to take more deliberate action when and if necessary.\nRegardless of the circumstances, we continue to move forward from a position of strength. We have a foundation of strong earnings and cash flow, an investment-grade credit rating, historically low pension obligation and outstanding vehicles, services and pricing. I like our position, and I wouldn't trade it with anyone in our industry. All of this will help us continue to execute our growth strategy and insulate it from short-term market challenges.\nCruise is an example. Without question, the Cruise team's launch of fully driverless commercial operations in San Francisco in June was historic. The next steps for Cruise in the second half include working with regulators to increase their hours of operation and service area, expanding their fleet of Bolt AVs and testing the Cruise Origin. And as always, we are committed to safety as Cruise expands.\nKyle Vogt and I will have much more to share about Cruise on September 12 at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco. We will also host our own event later that day for investors and analysts, including an opportunity to experience a fully driverless ride.\nAnother major highlight was the first customer deliveries of the Cadillac LYRIQ earlier this month. We are extremely proud of the LYRIQ, and it has received almost universal praise from the media, who says it stands with the Escalade as one of the best Cadillacs we've ever done. I can't wait until everyone sees the CELESTIQ in person.\nNearly 70% of the LYRIQ reservation holders are new to Cadillac, and 30% are from the West Coast. This is very similar to what we're seeing with the HUMMER EV, where 75% of reservation holders are new to GMC with a very heavy concentration in California, Texas and Florida.\nAnd looking ahead to early spring 2023, anticipation for the Chevrolet Silverado EV continues to build. We now have more than 150,000 reservations, and the average fleet customer is requesting more than 200 trucks. The reaction to the Chevrolet Blazer EV has also been very enthusiastic. We think the media who says it's going to shake up the electric SUV market, thanks to its design, technology, range and pricing, are spot on. Chevrolet will follow it up in September when it reveals even more affordable Equinox EV.\nAnd the ownership experience for all of our EV customers will be enhanced by agreements like the one we just signed with the Pilot Company to expand our Ultium 360 charging network to facilitate interstate travel. Together with EVgo, GM and Pilot plan to install 2,000 DC fast charger stalls at 50-mile intervals along U.S. interstate highways with special benefits for GM owners like exclusive reservations and discounts on charging. With Pilot investing $1 billion to upgrade their customer service, we are confident that this will be a very good solution for our customers.\nAnd as our EV strategy scales, the key question investors frequently ask is, how will you build enough batteries when competition for raw materials is intensifying? And as I've said, our strategy is to control our own destiny, and that includes building cells in partnership with LG Energy Solution.\nWe are just weeks away from the launch of the 7-day operations at the first Ultium Cells JV plant in Ohio. Then each quarter, the plant will add 20% to its capacity, reaching the full 35 gigawatt per hour capacity in Q4 of 2023. Securing cells from this plant are key to significantly ramping up production of the GMC HUMMER EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ to beat pent-up demand.\nThe second cell plant, which is under construction in Tennessee, is on track to open next year. And just last month, iron workers and our construction partners installed the final beam in a topping-out ceremony.\nIn Lansing, Michigan, the site of the third cell plant, the foundation work is underway, and steel work will begin in August. And that plant opens in 2024. And the team is also making good progress towards selecting the site for the fourth U.S. cell, which will take our projected total battery capacity to 160 gigawatts.\nWhat's happening upstream with these plants is just as critical to our long-term success. On previous calls, we had talked about all of the fully executed supply agreements GM has secured for EV raw materials and components.\nToday, we are announcing 3 more binding supply agreements. The first is with LG Chem, who will supply us with approximately 1 million tons of cathode material between now and 2030. We've also reached agreement with POSCO Chemical to supply us with CAM from their Korean operations from 2023 to 2025.\nThe third is a multiyear supply agreement with Livent to secure significant quantities of lithium. What this means is GM now has binding agreements securing all battery raw materials supporting our goal of 1 million units in annual capacity in North America in 2025. This includes lithium, nickel, cobalt and the full CAM supply.\nAs we move forward, we will increasingly localize our supply chain just as we have localized battery cell production. For example, due diligence is already underway to further expand capacity at the JV CAM and CAM precursor facility GM and POSCO Chemical are building in Quebec.\nGM and LG Chem will explore the localization of a CAM production facility in North America by the end of 2025. And Livent has a goal to transition 100% of the lithium hydroxide they are processing for GM to the U.S.\nI want to thank the team for their hard work to deliver this critical milestone, which includes close to 20 individual supply agreements. And I also want to thank our supplier partners. I use the word milestone deliberately because we are planning significant volume growth to meet our Investor Day commitment of $90 billion in annual EV revenue by 2030. That means our supply chain must be even more scalable, sustainable and resilient.\nTo that end, the team is building on existing supplier relationships and forging new ones. And for certain commodities, we will direct source up to 75% of our needs through 2030 with a focus on North America. We think this strategy will mitigate risk, drive down costs and help us deliver upside volume opportunities.\nAs you can see from these examples, every part of the company is rising to meet today's challenges. And we are adapting, changing and innovating to execute our pivot to EVs. We are being thorough, collaborative and leaving nothing to chance. And that's how we have made such huge strides and why we are so confident in our future.\nSo thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Paul.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I'm extremely proud of the team's execution in Q2 and remain excited about our future. We are at the beginning of an accelerating EV product ramp that we believe will drive a continuous increase in revenue as we transition to an all-electric future.\nAnd as Mary highlighted, we're making significant progress on several fronts, including Cruise commercialization and our battery supply chain. Just yesterday, the Department of Energy announced a conditional commitment to Ultium Cells LLC, our 50-50 joint venture to manufacture battery cells, for a $2.5 billion loan to help fund the construction of our battery cell manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan, supporting our goal of the secure battery materials and technology supply chain here in North America. We're also finalizing the deals of GM's sustainable finance framework, which will unlock options to help us align our balance sheet with our ESG strategy.\nNow let's get into the Q2 results. We generated $35.8 billion in revenue, up $1.6 billion year-over-year driven by strong pricing and slightly higher volume. We generated $2.3 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 6.6% EBIT-adjusted margin and $1.14 per share in EPS diluted adjusted, all within the $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion EBIT-adjusted range laid out earlier this month.\nOur results were impacted by the short-term tactical decision to build more than 90,000 North American vehicles without certain components with revenue retime from Q2 into the second half of 2022. The supply chain challenges causing the company vehicle inventory buildup primarily occurred in June and have continued in July, affecting some of our plans. While this is frustrating, we've built some of this uncertainty into our full year guidance.\nSome of these vehicles will be quick to complete. In fact, we've already wholesaled about 15,000 vehicles with the expectation to get through substantially all of the vehicles by the end of the year, with about 50% in Q3 and 50% in Q4. Despite these challenges, we've seen a continuous year-over-year volume improvement, Q1 up 1%, Q2 up 7%. And we expect Q3 to be up 90% to 100% year-over-year as we lap the significant impacts experienced in Q3 '21 and the retime vehicles, and Q4 to be up 20% to 30%, remaining on track to increase our 2022 wholesales by 25% to 30% year-over-year as we guided to at the beginning of the year.\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow was $1.4 billion for the quarter, down $1.1 billion year-over-year driven primarily by higher CapEx related to EV investments and the impact of holding these vehicles built without certain components in the company inventory.\nLet's take a closer look at North America. In Q2, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion, down $600 million year-over-year and EBIT-adjusted margins of 8% driven by higher commodity costs and investments in growth, partially offset by strong pricing across our portfolio, but especially on our full-size trucks and SUVs and the nonrecurrence of 2021 recall cost.\nOur mix was primarily impacted by the more than 90,000 vehicles built without certain components, about 75% of these being full-size trucks and SUVs. As Mary mentioned, new vehicles have continued to turn very quickly, and U.S. dealer inventory remains tight at around 250,000 units with much of this inventory in transit.\nInventory on dealer lots continues to be only 10 to 15 days. We continue to watch this very closely, but the consistently tight inventory on dealer lots over the last several quarters and months demonstrates the strong demand for our vehicles.\nTruck ATPs have continued to be very strong at over $60,000, and Denali continues to be a strength for GMC, accounting for nearly half of the total Yukon sales this year. Our truck and SUV customers have been asking for a broader range of choices, including premium options, which we are delivering on with the GMC Denali Ultimate, the GMC AT4X and the Cadillac Escalade V-Series. The investments we have made in these vehicles over the last couple of years, including the significant refresh to our full-size light-duty trucks earlier this year, provide a strong bridge to our all-electric future.\nNow let's move on to GM International. GMI delivered second quarter EBIT-adjusted of $200 million. This included $100 million of equity loss in China, down $350 million year-over-year driven primarily by their COVID-related impacts.\nHowever, we saw an improvement starting in June with production levels beginning to recover. The China team continues to navigate a very dynamic and difficult environment, both personally and professionally. I can't thank them enough for their efforts this quarter.\nEBIT-adjusted in GMI excluding China equity income was $300 million, up over $500 million year-over-year with results driven by favorable pricing, volume and mix, partially offset by commodity, logistics and semiconductor impacts. These results also include a mark-to-market gain of around $150 million.\nThe GMI results excluding China equity income and mark-to-market gain was a record Q2 and first half. The progress the team has made over the last couple of years has been impressive, and I look forward to the team continuing to build upon that momentum.\nA few comments on GM Financial and corporate expenses. GM Financial once again delivered solid results driven by strong used vehicle prices with Q2 EBT-adjusted of $1.1 billion, down $500 million year-over-year primarily due to the reserve adjustments made last year. Corporate expenses were $700 million in the quarter, up $700 million year-over-year driven primarily by differences in year-over-year mark-to-market changes in the portfolio.\nMoving to Cruise, which we are very excited about. We believe the autonomous opportunities go well beyond the robotaxi business, including delivery, personal vehicles and a commercial application with BrightDrop. Cruise expenses of $550 million for the quarter are consistent with the run rate we would expect for the remainder of the year.\nNow let's turn to our second half outlook. As we indicated earlier in the month, we're confident in achieving our full year 2022 guidance range metrics, including EBIT-adjusted in the range of $13 billion to $15 billion and North America margins of 10%.\nWe see tailwinds with volume, including completing the vehicles in company inventory. Pricing remains strong and has held up more than we estimated at the beginning of the year, helping partially offset the incremental commodity costs.\nWe are encouraged to see some moderation in the spot prices of certain raw materials, but the timing of the flow-through of this benefit into earnings varies by commodity and typically lags. We would not expect to see a meaningful impact until later in the year and into 2023.\nWe're also incurring significantly higher logistics costs, including premium freight, to overcome some of the supply chain challenges, which is offsetting some of the moderation in raw material costs. With these puts and takes in commodity and logistics costs, we still expect about a $5 billion year-over-year headwind impacting our global operations with the expectation to offset with cost and pricing actions.\nGM Financial is currently trending towards the high end of the expected $3.5 billion to $4 billion full year EBT range with some moderation anticipated in the second half as credit and used vehicle prices are expected to normalize somewhat. There are also other cost headwinds in the back half of the year, including some seasonality, growth investments and initiatives to drive EV adoption and expand charging infrastructure. However, we will be nimble in bringing on these costs at the appropriate time and remain prudent in our spending to ensure we meet our growth commitments.\nIn summary, the first half of the year, we've seen strong pricing and continue to see a recovery in volumes. We've executed well on the things we can control, and we remain focused on our growth opportunities.\nWe're starting to see the benefits of the EV and battery investments made over the last several years. And vehicles such as the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC HUMMER EV Pickup validate that we have transitioned our engineering and manufacturing expertise to EVs.\nWe're laser-focused on execution, and what you've seen is just the start of a transformative period for GM. We are strategically building an EV portfolio in the luxury, SUV and truck segments to produce vehicles with great design at the right price points for customers and at the margins we come to expect.\nThis concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, April 26, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nThanks, Sue. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Our conference call materials were issued this afternoon and are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.\nJoining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. In addition, Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Ashish, and welcome to General Motors, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, my remarks will focus on the ways in which the disciplined approach to our transformation is fueling momentum that will establish General Motors as an EV and AV leader across our product portfolio, our patented Ultium platform and our supply chain in addition to other initiatives. But I want to begin by thanking our employees, our dealers, our suppliers and our unions for helping us deliver yet another strong quarter, a clear measure of the momentum we have.\nOur strong earnings in the first quarter were very similar to a year ago, and they show that we deliver on our commitments. Going forward, we have many revenue and cost opportunities to deliver our full year guidance, which we are affirming today. Last quarter, we discussed our plans to launch more EVs faster because they are catalysts for our growth.\nWe have been very deliberate in our approach to get EVs right and to get solutions that are scalable and position us for leadership in key segments like pickups, luxury and affordable EVs, and deliver programs and services that support margin expansion. This includes the dedicated EV engineering group we formed in 2019 to develop the Ultium platform, the software organization that we brought together and when we created that same year to generate more reoccurring revenue by leveraging connectivity and the foundation of that is our vehicle intelligence platform and now Ultifi.\nThe EV growth organization we formed in 2020 to focus on the consumer experience and to take out inefficiencies of our distribution system. The 3 battery plants we are opening in the United States between this summer and 2024 with the fourth plant to be announced shortly. The creation of a sustainable, scalable and North America-focused EV supply chain to control our own destiny. And a manufacturing plant that leverages our talent and our scale, including the existing plants like Factory Zero, Spring Hill, CAMI and Orion. And also our close partnership with Honda, which includes both EVs and AVs. We are now in a rapid launch cycle because of the investments we've made over the last several years.\nTaking these steps has allowed us to establish an unparalleled foundation on which to execute and scale. Because of this, our drive to produce 400,000 EVs in North America over the course of '22 and '23 is underway. For example, in the short span of time, the Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands will launch 6 high-volume EV products into luxury, SUV and truck segments, all enabled by Ultium. We are also working on a fully electric Corvette, as Mark shared yesterday, as well as an electrified Corvette that will arrive next year. And I have to tell you, the response has been overwhelming.\nSo by the end of 2025, we will have installed capacity to build 1 million EVs in North America, representing approximately $50 billion in annual revenue. And we will have 3 EV programs in North America, each with annual production volumes of more than 125,000 units with opportunities to expand. This is a great start toward delivering our $90 billion of EV revenue by 2030.\nCadillac will be our first all-electric brand, and its journey began last month with the production launch of the LYRIQ. Unlike all of our EV entries to date, the response has been very strong. We began taking orders for the full -- we will begin taking orders for the full range of LYRIQ models on May 19, and production at Spring Hill will accelerate through the second half of the year and into 2023. And I have to tell you, I was at the plant last week and the LYRIQ looks absolutely great.\nWe will also have more affordable models that will be a major source of growth for Chevrolet and Buick. We are quickly regaining momentum with the Bolt EV and EUV now that production has resumed. In fact, we plan to produce more than 50,000 Bolt EVs this year for global markets, including a record 40,000 deliveries in the U.S.\nThe first high-volume Ultium-based SUVs for Chevrolet will launch next year. Chevrolet has already previewed the all-electric Blazer SS, its first fully electric SS model. We'll reveal the full vehicle in July, and it goes into production mid next year.\nIn early fall, we will reveal the Equinox EV, and the launch is scheduled just after the Blazer EV. With a starting price of around $30,000 MSRP, the Equinox EV is a true white space opportunity for us since most affordable EVs from Chevy's competitors start at $40,000 or more.\nOf course, our biggest growth opportunity in North America is in trucks. We have led the industry in full-size pickup sales for the last 2 years, and we will lead in EV pickups as well. We'll do it by leveraging the capability and flexibility of our purpose-built Ultium platform and decades of truck design and engineering expertise as well as extensive customer insights.\nThe GMC HUMMER EV Pickup is just the beginning. People who have driven the HUMMER EV confirmed it is a super truck. One media influencer said, \"You somehow mixed the Raptor, TRX, Bronco and Wrangler all in 1 package, made it electric and better than all of them.\" We agree.\nMarch was our best month for the HUMMER EV reservation since we unveiled the SUV a year ago. We now have more than 70,000 reservations for the pickup and SUV models, and we are accelerating production through 2022 and into 2023. You will see many of the HUMMER EV's best attributes available in the Chevrolet Silverado EV, including superior range, faster fast-charging capability, 4-wheel steering, Super Cruise and a larger, far more flexible pickup cab and bed compared to our closest competitor.\nJust yesterday, we shared that Ultium vehicles, including the HUMMER EV and Silverado EV, have a new patented energy recovery system that uses heat from the battery packs to optimize range, performance, charging times and passenger comfort without adding mass or cost. These are the kinds of Ultium platform innovations that are driving a surge in Silverado EV demand and are an example of the benefits of taking the time to establish a dedicated and scalable platform. We are now at 140,000 reservations and growing, including retail customers in nearly 400 fleet operators, up from 240 last quarter.\nProduction of the Silverado EV will begin at Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck in just 11 months, followed by Orion Assembly in 2024. We will begin building preproduction Silverado EVs in a matter of weeks.\nThe supply chain supporting our EV production will also be a competitive advantage for us. Our strategy is to control our own destiny. So we forge long-term strategic relationships. We have invested alongside industry leaders and start-ups alike. And we are sourcing as much as possible from North America and strong trading partners like Australia. This includes rare earth material, permanent magnets, cathode active material and lithium as well as the cobalt agreement we announced this month with Glencore. We're also in the process of securing additional long-term supply agreements for nickel.\nEven as we scale our EV and AV businesses, which currently account for about 80% of our product capital spend, the earnings power of our ICE business will grow. In the first quarter, for example, we launched new versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra. These trucks have new designs, technology and improved functionality, including a new 13.4-inch infotainment screen on most models, Super Cruise with hands-free trailering and new off-road and premium models like the Silverado ZR2 and the Sierra Denali Ultimate. To help meet demand, we will add a third shift at our Oshawa assembly plant during the summer to build both light-duty and heavy-duty models.\nAt the same time, we are executing major reductions in complexity and engineering expense across our ICE portfolio. For example, we compressed the footprint for today's Equinox and Terrain from 3 to 2 plants, enabling us to create white space capacity for EV expansion. We also achieved about a 70% parts sharing and reuse on these models, along with more than a 90% reduction in build combinations.\nWe sharply reduced build combinations of the Silverado as well, and we're applying these significant cost avoidance strategies across all of our next-gen ICE programs. For example, our next-generation Traverse, Enclave and Acadia will have 1/3 fewer unique parts and launch with higher EBIT than today's models.\nI'd like to wrap up with an update on Cruise. During the quarter, we took the opportunity to increase our ownership position to approximately 80% because we are extremely bullish on the team's rapid progress toward commercialization. As Kyle shared on our last call, Cruise continues to make great progress safely and deliberately expanding its full driverless operations in San Francisco.\nCruise is now operating in about 70% of the city and is moving toward operating 24/7 across the entire city by the end of this year. Already, the fleet has traveled about 40x the distance from San Francisco to New York City, all in driverless mode and all in a highly complex environment. This includes several hundred rides for members of the public. We'll have more Cruise news to share as it completes a permitting process to charge for rides in San Francisco and as the Cruise Origin launch at Factory ZERO approaches.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. We delivered a very strong first quarter, including over 10% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled by robust demand for our products, especially for our full-size trucks and SUVs. Our plants were largely running regular production as the team worked to overcome semiconductor and other supply constraints. Strong customer demand for our products has continued into April, with most vehicles continuing to turn immediately as they arrive at dealers.\nAs Mary highlighted, we've continued to take strategic actions designed to create long-term shareholder value and prioritize investments in EVs and AVs that will help accelerate our growth. In the case of Cruise, we utilized approximately $3.5 billion in cash to capitalize on an opportunity to increase our ownership percentage from just over 60% to approximately 80% at a very attractive private market valuation.\nOur increased ownership percentage in Cruise triggered a reconsolidation for income tax purposes and lowered our expected full year adjusted effective tax rate by 3 percentage points to approximately 20%. As a result, and to be transparent, we increased our full year EPS diluted adjusted guidance by $0.25 to address this. This transaction is directly in line with our capital allocation priorities to invest in businesses that drive outsized growth opportunities given the tremendous long-term potential we see at Cruise.\nNow let's turn to Q1 results. We generated $36 billion in revenue, $4 billion in EBIT adjusted, 11.2% EBIT adjusted margin and $2.09 per share in EPS diluted adjusted. These results demonstrate the resiliency of the team and our ability to mitigate the impacts of higher commodity costs as well as investments in our growth in EV transition. In fact, our results were similar to the first quarter of last year despite $2.5 billion in higher costs, highlighting the strength of our products and the demand environment. Sequentially, we saw growth in total company wholesale volumes of 12% from Q4 2021.\nWe recognize the consumer is facing inflationary pressures. However, we continue to see ongoing strong customer demand for our vehicles, including our refreshed full-size pickup trucks, as Mary mentioned. We were able to protect against significant plant downtime, and the team worked effectively to minimize the impact of continued short-term disruptions from semiconductor and other challenges. Overall, we see the availability of semiconductors continuing to improve and are working closely with our supply chain partners to help deliver our full year total company wholesale volume goal of 25% to 30% growth.\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow was breakeven for the quarter, an improvement of $1.9 billion year-over-year, driven by favorable working capital, partially offset by higher CapEx and nonrecurrence of a GM Financial dividend during the quarter.\nNow let's take a closer look at North America. In Q1, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $3.1 billion, flat year-over-year, driven by strong pricing on our full-size trucks and SUVs, offset by higher commodity costs and investments in growth. We're also pleased to achieve EBIT-adjusted margins in North America of 10.7%, on track with our 2022 full year guidance of 10%. New vehicles have continued to turn very quickly, and U.S. dealer inventories remained tight at around 270,000 units with much of this inventory in transit. That grounded inventory on dealer lots is less than 15 days. We continue to see ATP increases across our vehicle segments, including year-over-year increase of 10% for trucks and 20% for crossovers.\nWhile the first quarter presented challenges for commodity and logistics costs, our teams are working effectively to manage these dynamics. We have contractual protections in place for some commodities to help ensure supply and to provide some protection against cost volatility. We also made some proactive decisions early in the year to bolster our supply and provide pricing protection. For example, we secured palladium inventory that is sufficient to meet our production needs through the end of this year. Through these actions, our commodity and logistics headwinds year-over-year came in line with our expectations at around $1 billion in Q1.\nConsistent with prior guidance, we saw increased investments, primarily in engineering and software development resources as we continue to vertically integrate to help drive revenue from our new hardware and software platforms.\nNow let's move to GM International. GMI delivered first quarter EBIT adjusted of $300 million, results consistent with Q1 2021. This included $200 million of equity income in China, down $100 million year-over-year, driven primarily by recent COVID impacts, partially offset by stabilization in pricing and continued cost actions. EBIT-adjusted in GMI, excluding China, was $100 million, up $100 million year-over-year, with results driven by both favorable volume, pricing and mix, partially offset by commodity and semiconductor impacts. We continue to see momentum in the international business, and I'm really proud of the work that the team has been doing.\nA few comments on GM Financial and corporate expenses. GM Financial delivered solid results again driven by strong used vehicle prices and favorable credit performance, with Q1 EBT adjusted of $1.3 billion, up $100 million year-over-year. Used vehicle prices were modestly lower sequentially in Q1 to Q4, but we would not expect to see an impact unless used car values decline another 10% to 15% from current prices. Corporate expenses were $400 million in the quarter, almost exclusively driven by differences in year-over-year mark-to-market changes, which also includes the full year -- or the first quarter profitability for the whole company.\nMoving to Cruise. As I mentioned earlier, we captured an opportunity in Q1 to acquire additional shares in Cruise, and we also initiated a program to provide an ongoing liquidity opportunity for Cruise employees. The liquidity opportunity included a modification to existing equity awards to remove the requirement for liquidity event vesting, resulting in Cruise recognizing a $1.1 billion compensation expense in Q1 for the awards that would have previously reached their time vesting threshold.\nWe treated this expense as special for purposes of EBIT adjusted given the expense would have been recognized previously under the modified terms. Going forward, future stock compensation expenses at Cruise will be recognized over the vesting period in earnings. Inclusive of the incremental stock compensation expenses, we expect full year 2022 expenses at Cruise to be approximately $2 billion.\nTurning to our 2022 outlook for the calendar year. We have a number of tools at our disposal as we've demonstrated to help offset higher costs and are taking active steps to ensure that we deliver on our full year 2022 guidance range of EBIT adjusted of $13 billion to $15 billion and North American margins of 10%. We're utilizing similar strategies as we have in the past to offset these commodity and logistics costs, which are currently projected to be approximately $2.5 billion higher than the $2.5 billion included in our original guidance earlier this year. These strategies include pricing actions as well as holding additional inventory of key commodities to manage price and global trade volatility. And as Mary mentioned, we're also being proactive in finding cost efficiencies throughout the company.\nIn summary, we're off to a good start to the year, and the team is laser-focused in a dynamic environment while, at the same time, executing on the launch of the Cadillac LYRIQ, accelerating production of the GMC HUMMER EV and preparing for our future mass-market EV product launches. We are making the right long-term strategic decisions for the business, executing on our transformation that will support the long-term earnings power of the company and creating significant value for the shareholders. We are very optimistic about the future of the company and our vision of an all-electric future.\nI will now turn it back over to Mary for one last comment.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Paul. I've said many times that the resiliency and creativity are drivers for our success, so is accountability. One reason why Cruise has accomplished so much so quickly is that the team is inspired by its mission, and everyone has a financial stake in the company's success. The new equity compensation program Cruise created is designed to reinforce its culture and to help to continue to attract the best and the brightest talent. (inaudible) has been very well received, and it will help keep everyone focused on the mission at hand.\nAt GM, our compensation has always been driven by the company's success, and no one should doubt our commitment to lead in EVs or the passion our team has for that mission. That's why this is the right time to directly link a significant part of the long-term compensation for me and every other GM executive to meeting our EV goals.\nStarting this year, we have added metrics for EV volumes in North America, EV launch timing and EV launch quality to our existing EBIT margin and total shareholder return measures. The metrics are in place now, and they will appear in our proxy statement, which we'll file on April 29, but I wanted to share the news today to underscore our commitment to our EV future.\nNow Paul and I are happy to take your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, February 1, 2022.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nRocky Gupta\n\nVP & Treasurer, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2021. Our conference call materials were issued earlier this afternoon and are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.\nI'm joined today by GM's Chair and CEO, Mary Barra; GM's CFO, Paul Jacobson; GM Financial CEO, Dan Berce; and Cruise Co-Founder, Kyle Vogt. Kyle will be available to speak about Cruise's exciting progress in the Q&A portion of the call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.\nWe'll now turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nChairman & CEO, General Motors Company\n\nThanks, Rocky, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before we get into our 2021 results and 2022 outlook, I want to start with some exciting news from Cruise, which is one of our most significant growth opportunities. Kyle, Dan Kan, Gil West and the entire Cruise team are doing great work, and they just delivered a key milestone on the drive to commercialization -- to commercialize Cruise rideshare service. As Kyle has shared, Cruise team members have been taking fully driverless rides in San Francisco since November to demonstrate and refine the software and hardware ecosystem we have created together. In fact, they have logged over 20,000 miles and completed more than 600 trips. I rode in a driverless Cruise a couple of weeks ago, and I can tell you it was the highlight of my career as an engineer and as the leader of General Motors. The ride is smooth and confident. It's like having an experience and attentive driver behind the wheel.\nNow as Cruise announced this morning, it is inviting members of the public to sign up for their own driverless rides through a waitlist on the Cruise website. This is the first truly driverless ride-hail service offered to members of the public in a dense urban environment. To maximize its learnings, Cruise will prioritize use cases that are natural fits for autonomous ridesharing. This major milestone brings Cruise even closer to offering its first paid rides and generating $50 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade. It also means that the SoftBank Vision Fund will invest as planned another $1.35 billion in Cruise. This is another strong vote of confidence in the Cruise team, its technology and the services it's creating.\nAdditionally, Cruise continues to advance the strong relationship it has established with Walmart where the team is making progress on driverless deliveries of groceries to customers every day. With this incremental investment and the investments from General Motors in companies like Honda, Microsoft and Walmart, Cruise is very well capitalized to scale its business when the origin production comes online at Factory ZERO late this year. So Kyle, congrats.\nNow I want to turn to the significant investments we are making to expand both our battery cell and EV assembly capacity. We believe our strategy to scale a common LTM cell, component set and platform will create significant long-term value for all GM stakeholders. We also recognize that we need to launch more EVs faster. So that's exactly what we are going to do.\nAs you know, the GMC HUMMER EV is already in the market. Cadillac LYRIQ deliveries begin in less than 60 days, and additional BrightDrop EV600 production begins at CAMI late this year where we'll launch with an annual capacity of 30,000 units and the ability to nearly double production by mid-decade. The Chevrolet Silverado EV launches next spring, and the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer EVs will also reach the market in 2023.\nWe have the teams working to accelerate the volume curves for all of these launches and to resume both EV and EUV production as soon as possible. And we have set a target to deliver 400,000 EVs in North America over the course of 2022 and 2023.\nAs you know, we have also announced additional battery cell and assembly capacity investments in Michigan that will give us more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of 2025, and this includes 600,000 full-size trucks. This is in addition to more than 1 million units of EV capacity in China over the same time frame. And I can tell you right now, 1 million units in North America won't be enough to meet the steep inflection in demand that we expect starting mid-decade for our EVs. That's why we will continue to convert ICE capacity to EVs and plan to invest in a third EV truck plant. We are formulating plans for the truck plant right now, and we will share more as we work through the details.\nImportantly, battery cells will not be a constraint to our long-term EV growth. Our Ultium cell JVs in Ohio and Tennessee come online in 2022 and 2023, respectively. And we will add capacity as demand grows. Our Ohio plant will launch with 7-day operations, adding 10% capacity and 200 jobs. Cell production in Michigan is scheduled to begin in late 2024. And I'm sharing today that we will announce the location of our fourth U.S. cell plant in the first half of this year. Together, these plants will support GM's EV volume growth and supply our customers in the rail, trucking, aerospace and marine industries.\nEqually important for our EV strategy for North America is that it is backed by a strong, more sustainable North American-focused supply chain that includes lithium, rare earth material, permanent magnets, cathode active material, silicon carbide, motor staters and more. To deliver this acceleration, we are pulling ahead significant investment into the 2022 to 2025 time frame, and we will share more details as we further refine our plans.\nGrowing customer demand for the first wave of Ultium products strongly supports these investments. We already have more than 59,000 reservations for the GMC HUMMER EV pickup and SUV. Not surprisingly, some of the first owners are very prominent figures in the sports and entertainment industries, and their initial feedback has been just incredible. They expected a super truck, and they got one.\nOur next electric pickup will be the Chevrolet Silverado EV. More than 110,000 Silverado EVs are reserved so far, including reservations from more than 240 fleet operators, and the numbers keep growing every day. Some of the world's largest fleet customers, including FedEx, Verizon, Merchants Fleet and Walmart, are adopting BrightDrop vehicles and their technology. All told, we have more than 25,000 production reservations for BrightDrop cargo vans. And customer interest in the Cadillac LYRIQ is growing so quickly that will forgo a new round of reservations and begin taking customer orders soon after the debut edition launches in March. One of our most highly anticipated reveals this year will be the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which we previewed in January. The Verge named it the best electric car of CES, saying there's a perception that electric vehicles are luxury items. So when General Motors said the Equinox would come with a $30,000 sticker price, it's something worth noting.\nThe efficiencies created by the Ultium platform are a key reason why we will be able to deliver truly affordable EVs like the Equinox. Affordable EVs are part of the market that start-ups aren't targeting, but they are key to driving mass adoption of EVs, which is a national and a global priority. That's why we plan to follow the Equinox with an even more affordable EV.\nNow let's shift and talk a little bit about our other GM growth platform. Throughout the year, you will see the expansion of advanced vehicle technologies, new shopping tools and continued progress at our new business start-ups. This spring, we will launch redesigns of the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra 1500 pickups and offer them with Super Cruise with expanded capabilities that include lane change on demand and hands-free trailering. These are first for the segment.\nIn the same time frame, GM and our dealers will begin marketing CarBravo, our new used vehicle shopping service. This is truly a win-win. Our dealers will grow their business by offering customers online access to far more inventory than other services. In turn, we expect to drive incremental GM and GM Financial revenue by selling products like OnStar Insurance, OnStar Connected Services, accessories and financial services. It will also help support strong residual values for off-lease vehicles. Then next year, we'll roll out Ultifi, a new end-to-end software platform for EVs, AVs and ICE vehicles that will have even more sweeping over-the-air capabilities than we have today. This includes the ability to back half features to the Cadillac LYRIQ. Ultifi will be the foundation for new GM developed and approved third-party apps, in-car subscriptions and other connected services that enhance the customer experience and expand our revenue through the life of each vehicle. We can and we will keep up our aggressive pace backed by strong results. We expect to follow our record EBIT-adjusted earnings in 2021 with another year of record or near-record results in 2022 while investing significantly more year-over-year to accelerate our growth. Paul will share more details on our results and guidance in his remarks.\nBut before I turn the call over to him, I would like to discuss our capital allocation strategy. The prospect of continued strong earnings and free cash flow, even as we invest for growth, naturally raises questions about resuming a common stock dividend. As we move forward, we will consider all opportunities to return excess capital to shareholders, but we will not reinstate a dividend at this time. Our clear priority is to accelerate our EV plan and drive growth, and we want to maintain maximum flexibility to invest as opportunities arise across our growth platforms, including many of the accelerated plans I've outlined today. I think we've consistently demonstrated that we're a team that delivers on our commitments. That's more important now than ever with the incredible opportunities in front of us.\nSo now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul who will walk us through the quarter and our outlook. Then Paul, Dan Berce, Kyle Vogt and I will take your questions.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, General Motors Company\n\nThank you, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to join us. As Mary mentioned, the strong results last year, including record full year EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins, are a reflection of the hard work and execution from our team and the underlying strength of our business. We're seeing strong demand for our products, especially our trucks and SUVs, and we are striving again this year to produce as many of them as we can. I want to thank the entire GM team once more for the execution during this past year.\nThe cash that we generate today is funding the transformation of GM in pursuit of the growth strategy we shared last year in our Investor Day. We see a path to doubling revenue by 2030 while expanding margins with significant opportunities in software, services and new businesses in electric and autonomous vehicles.\nNow let's get into the results. While we face the well-publicized global semiconductor challenges and continued pressure from COVID protocols throughout the world, the GM team once again delivered tremendous results in 2021 through our production prioritization and work across our value chain. For the full year, we generated $127 billion in revenue, $14.3 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 11.3% EBIT-adjusted margin, $7.07 in EPS diluted adjusted and $2.6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we generated $34 billion in revenue, $2.8 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 8.5% EBIT-adjusted margin, $1.35 in EPS diluted adjusted and $6.4 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was largely driven by working capital rewind as we were able to complete and wholesale over 80,000 vehicles that had previously been built without certain components as well as dividends from GM Financial.\nWe saw improved semiconductor availability in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, which enabled us to increase our wholesale sequentially while substantially reducing our inventory of vehicles built without certain components, and we expect ongoing semiconductor availability improvements throughout 2022. We also realized strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategy. Additionally, used vehicle prices and strong credit performance continued to drive record results at GM Financial.\nSo let's take a closer look at North America. In Q4, GM North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.2 billion as we continue to see robust customer demand for our products and tight dealer inventory, driving strong transaction prices. These results were somewhat better than our December updated guidance expectations as we saw continued volume and cost improvement.\nOn a year-over-year basis, in the fourth quarter, we saw volume decreases and increased investments in growth, partially offset by pricing and mix. U.S. dealer inventories ended the year at around 200,000 units, of which only approximately 25% is grounded stock, resulting in continued high sales turns of around 10 days.\nMoving to GM International. In the fourth quarter, GMI EBIT adjusted was approximately $0.3 billion, relatively flat year-over-year. China equity income was $0.2 billion in the quarter with continued strong mix, stabilization in pricing and material cost performance, offset by semiconductor and commodity impact.\nAs we referenced last quarter, our international business outside of China has made substantial progress on our path to sustainable profitability. GMI EBIT-adjusted, excluding China equity income, achieved profitability in the fourth quarter despite continued semiconductor pressure, and the Chevrolet brand has regained its retail market share leadership in South America.\nA few comments on GM Financial and the Corp segment. GM Financial concluded another extremely strong year with Q4 EBT-adjusted of $1.2 billion, with record full year EBT-adjusted of $5 billion. GM Financial paid an additional $1.7 billion dividend in Q4. That brings the total GM Financial dividends to $3.5 billion in 2021, equivalent to how much we paid for the company. Going forward, we expect GM Financial dividends to moderate as earnings normalize and we continue to grow the asset base. Corp EBIT-adjusted in Q4 was down year-over-year by about $0.5 billion driven by the nonrecurrence of mark-to-market gains recognized in Q4 2020.\nNow turning to our outlook for 2022. Today, we see a stabilizing semiconductor environment and envision wholesale getting to a normalized run rate towards the beginning of the third quarter with a target of around 800,000 units in North America on a quarterly basis. We expect total company volume to increase 25% to 30% year-over-year, with the majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year, primarily due to the production constraints in the second half of 2021. Sequentially, we expect the positive trend to continue, with Q1 wholesale volumes up 20% to 25% versus Q4 2021.\nIn 2022, we anticipate light industry sales of approximately 16 million units, dealer stock to remain tight and the dynamic where production is the gating factor for sales volumes continuing into 2022. As you think about the mix of this incremental volume, remember that in 2021, we largely protected our high-demand truck production. As a result, the incremental volume in 2022 will be mostly weighted towards small and midsized SUVs and sedan.\nNow let's turn to our expectations for growth investments in margins. We're at a very important stage in the growth and development of some of our key businesses, and we are taking the very intentional step of investing heavily into them to accelerate our expansion. Cruise expenses are expected to increase as they rapidly approach commercialization and hire around 500 additional employees, increasing their workforce by around 20% to advanced technology as well as accelerate the operational infrastructure to grow and expand. We also expect to see some wage rate pressure as we continue to attract top talent to the company.\nCorporate expenses are expected to increase by approximately $0.5 billion as we expand the BrightDrop business, including product development and manufacturing spend to prepare the CAMI facility for ELCV production later in the year, and expanding customer pilots for the EP1 electric card, which we expect will drive software and services recurring revenue opportunities. We're going to continue to roll out OnStar Insurance across the country. We're in 46 states today and expect to be in all 50 by the second quarter. We're going to develop new products at GM Defense and continue to incubate new ideas to drive incremental growth and value in the future. We're also expecting to invest another $1.5 billion in expenses to expand software development and further accelerate our EV portfolio, which includes close to $1 billion of incremental engineering and software-related development. These investments are building the foundation to grow and accelerate our AV, EV and software businesses as we aggressively launch approximately 20 EV products in North America and more than 30 EV products globally through 2025 and introduce Ultifi. These investments will also drive meaningful revenue growth starting in 2023, initially from EVs, BrightDrop and Cruise, but expanding the software and services as we launch Ultifi and grow other new business opportunities such as OnStar Insurance and GM Defense in the next few years.\nWe're now also expecting commodities and logistics cost pressure of $2.5 billion year-over-year, primarily weighted to the front half of 2022. From a nonoperating perspective, we expect a combined $1 billion year-over-year headwind from the nonrecurrence of mark-to-market gains we achieved in 2021 and a reduction in net pension income as we further de-risk the planned asset profile. I want to reiterate that despite all of this, we expect to generate 10% North America EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022, inclusive of the increased expenditures related to our growth investments and highlighting our ability to fund these initiatives through internally generated cash flow.\nIn China, we expect equity income from our joint ventures to exceed $1 billion and remain relatively flat year-over-year. We anticipate a modest increase in volume, which will be offset by a more normalized mix, competitive pricing environment and increased investments as we prepare to bring more EV products to market.\nWe expect GM Financial performance to be in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range as we do not expect a repeat of some of the 2021 allowance releases, and we anticipate that credit performance in used vehicle prices will begin to moderate. Assuming continued steady demand for new vehicles, no significant new economic or supply chain challenges in 2022, we expect EBIT adjusted in the $13 billion to $15 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $6.25 to $7.25 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $7 billion to $9 billion rate. Adjusted automotive free cash flow will be driven by strong earnings and working capital rewind as volumes increase. We expect capital spend to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range in 2022, including investments in our Ultium battery cell JVs, and expect similar levels of spending over the next several years.\nIn summary, we had a strong finish to the year, and our results are a reflection of the team's focus and execution in the face of the continued challenging environment. In 2022, we expect strong commercial performance, and we are aggressively reinvesting some of our short-term EBIT improvement to accelerate our EV, AV journey while still driving similar results to our record performance in 2021. This demonstrates the strength of our underlying business, the strength of our truck and SUV franchises, our industry-leading customer loyalty and world-class manufacturing and design capabilities. We will continue to leverage these competitive advantages as we vastly expand our battery cell and EV assembly capacity in North America to lead the industry.\nThis concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.",

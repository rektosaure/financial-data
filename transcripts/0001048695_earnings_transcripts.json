I'll now turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. We delivered exceptional fiscal year 2025 results, exceeding $3 billion in revenue and $1 billion in operating profit for the first time. Revenue grew 10%, while earnings per share grew 18%. Our growth was driven by data center reinvestment, hybrid cloud adoption and enterprise AI infrastructure demand.\nOur product refresh cycle, competitive takeouts and the maturation of our software model and go-to-market motions also contributed to growth. In FY '25, we maintained our strong profitability delivering gross margins of 83.6%, up 80 basis points over FY '24; an operating margin of 35.2%, up 160 basis points over FY '24. This performance resulted in record free cash flow of $906 million, up 19% compared to FY '24, underscoring the strength of our financial model and execution.\nOur FY '25 results demonstrate the power of our platform and our strategic role in the marketplace. They also strengthen our confidence in our vision and road map for the future. Our immediate focus, however, has been on our incident response, and I will speak to our priorities and offer an update on where we are now. Upon identifying the threat on August 9, our team immediately activated our incident response process. Our priorities were clear: first, contain the threat actor, initiate a thorough investigation and take immediate and urgent action to strengthen F5 security posture.\nWhile the investigation will continue and the work of bolstering our security posture will expand, our initial steps have been successful. Second, we prioritized delivering reliable software releases to address all undisclosed high vulnerabilities in BIG-IP code as quickly as possible. Through the exceptional efforts of our engineering and support teams, we achieved this enabling thousands of customers to promptly deploy critical updates upon disclosure.\nOur customers are moving quickly to update their BIG-IP environment and a significant number of our largest customers have completed their updates with minimal disruption. As an example, a North American technology provider completed updates to 814 devices in a 6-hour window in the first weekend. Customers have expressed appreciation for our transparency, the thoroughness of the information we provided and the clarity in the steps they need to take to improve the security of their environments.\nOur third priority is raising the bar on security across all aspects of our business. We are acutely aware of the increasing sophistication of attackers and the fact that the threat surface is expanding rapidly. Each year, over the last several years, we have aggressively increased our investment in security and we are making further significant investment this year and beyond.\nTo further this work, Michael Montoya, a recognized cybersecurity expert and former member of our Board, has joined F5 as Chief Technology Operations Officer. Michael brings deep operational expertise and will drive the execution of a robust road map to further enhance security across our internal processes, environments and products. Our goal across all these actions is to better protect our customers, and we believe F5 will be a stronger partner to customers because of it.\nWe know customers will judge us by how we respond to this incident. Throughout this process, we have been committed to transparent customer communication at every step, reflecting lessons learned from how others have navigated similar challenges. We acknowledge that we may see some near-term impact to our business. We are fully focused on mitigating that impact, while doubling down on the value we deliver to our customers.\nStepping back, it is evident that advanced nation-state threat actors are targeting technology companies and most recently, perimeter security companies. We are committed to learning from this incident, sharing our insights with customers and peers and driving collaborative innovation to collectively strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure across the industry.\nNow I will turn the call over to Cooper, who will walk you through our Q4 results and our outlook. Following his remarks, I will return to discuss the broader business trends and some key customer highlights. Cooper?\n\nEdward Cooper Werner\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Francois, and hello, everyone. I will review our Q4 results and some selected full fiscal '25 results before I elaborate on our outlook for FY '26 and Q1. We delivered a strong Q4, growing revenue 8% to $810 million with a mix of 49% global services revenue and 51% product revenue. Global Services revenue of $396 million grew 2% year-over-year, while product revenue totaled $414 million, increasing 16% year-over-year.\nSystems revenue totaled $186 million, up 42% over Q4 of FY '24, driven by tech refresh and data center modernization, direct and indirect AI use cases as well as competitive takeouts. Our software revenue of $229 million was up slightly against an exceptionally strong Q4 of FY '24. Perpetual license software totaled $30 million, up 25% year-over-year. Subscription-based software declined 3% year-over-year to $198 million, reflecting the transition of our legacy SaaS and managed service revenue offerings and to a lesser extent, customers' preference for hardware-based solutions for certain use cases, a trend which emerged over the course of FY '25.\nRevenue from recurring sources contributed 72% of our Q4 revenue. Our recurring revenue consists of our subscription-based revenue and the maintenance portion of our global services revenue. Shifting to revenue distribution by region. Our teams drove growth across all theaters. Revenue from the Americas grew 7% year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA delivered 7% growth, representing 26% of revenue, and APAC grew 19% representing 17% of revenue.\nLooking at our major verticals, enterprise customers represented 73% of Q4's product bookings. Government customers represented 19% of product bookings, including 6% from U.S. Federal. Finally, service providers represented 8% of Q4 product bookings. Our continued financial discipline contributed to our strong Q4 operating results. GAAP gross margin was 82.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.3%, an increase of 138 basis points from Q4 FY '24. Our GAAP operating expenses were $461 million.\nOur non-GAAP operating expenses were $384 million. Our GAAP operating margin was 25.4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.0%, an improvement of 255 basis points year-over-year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.9%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $190 million or $3.26 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $257 million or $4.39 per share, reflecting 20% EPS growth from the year ago period.\nI will now turn to cash flow and balance sheet metrics, all of which were very strong. We generated $208 million in cash flow from operations in Q4. CapEx was $16 million. DSO for the quarter was 46 days. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.36 billion at quarter end. Deferred revenue was $2.0 billion, up 11% from the year ago period. We generated $906 million in free cash flow for all of FY '25, up 19% from FY '24, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 29%, highlighting the strength of our business fundamentals.\nIn Q4, we repurchased $125 million worth of F5 shares at an average price of $297 per share. For the year, we repurchased shares equivalent to 55% of our annual free cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately 6,580 employees.\nFrancois recapped our high-level FY '25 results at the start of the call, I will elaborate on our annual software and security revenue results. Software grew 9% year-over-year, totaling $803 million with software subscriptions representing 85% of FY '25 software revenue. Our software revenue is comprised of perpetual software licenses, term-based subscriptions and SaaS and managed services. Perpetual software licenses contributed $120 million in software revenue, up 7% year-over-year.\nTerm-based subscriptions contributed $508 million to our software revenue, up 18% year-over-year, driven by continued strong renewals and expansions. SaaS and Managed Services contributed $176 million in revenue, down 9% year-over-year, reflecting growth from F5 distributed cloud services, offset by the transition of our legacy offerings. Total annualized recurring revenue for our SaaS and managed services offerings ended the year at $185 million, up slightly from FY '24, including 21% growth in ARR for our core SaaS and managed services solutions.\nARR from legacy offerings declined to $15 million as we wound down legacy SaaS and managed service offerings and transition customers to F5 distributed cloud services. We expect to complete any remaining transitions in the first half of FY '26. Several years ago, we began breaking out our security-related revenue annually. This year, our total security revenue, which includes stand-alone security, attached security and maintenance revenue related to security, grew 6% to approximately $1.2 billion or 39% of total revenue.\nStand-alone security revenue totaled $463 million, representing 31% of product revenue. Let me now address our outlook beginning with FY '26. Unless otherwise noted, our guidance references non-GAAP metrics. We delivered an exceptional FY '25, exceeding expectations with stronger-than-expected systems demand and continued healthy expansion in our software subscription business. As we enter FY '26, we see several persistent demand drivers, including hybrid multi-cloud adoption, driving expansion across our platform, continuing strong systems refresh opportunity with more than half of our installed base on legacy systems nearing end of software support.\nGrowing systems demand beyond tech refresh for data sovereignty and AI readiness use cases, and a return to growth in revenue from our SaaS and managed services with the transition of legacy offerings largely completed in FY '25. These drivers in our current pipeline support mid-single-digit revenue growth in FY '26 against our exceptional 10% growth in FY '25. However, we also anticipate some near-term disruption to sales cycles as customers focus on assessing and remediating their environments.\nTaking this into account, we are guiding FY '26 revenue growth in the range of 0% to 4% with any demand impacts expected to be more pronounced in the first half, before normalizing in the second half.\nMoving to our operating model. We recognize the revenue guide may lead to a modest impact to our operating margin near term. We are committed to driving continued operating margin leverage and believe any demand impact is likely to be short term and therefore, any effect on our operating model would also be temporary. With that context, we estimate FY '26 gross margin in a range of 83% to 83.5%. We estimate FY '26 non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%, with operating margins lowest in our fiscal Q2 due to payroll tax resets in January and costs associated with our large customer event in March.\nWe expect our FY '26 non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 22%, and we expect FY '26 EPS in a range of $14.50 to $15.50. Finally, we intend to continue to use at least 50% of our free cash flow towards share repurchases in FY '26.\nTurning to our Q1 outlook. We expect Q1 revenue in the range of $730 million to $780 million. This is a wider range than we would typically guide, reflecting the potential for some near-term disruption to sales cycles. While we are not guiding revenue mix, we expect Q1 software to be down year-over-year given the strong growth in the year ago period. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 82.5% to 83.5%. We estimate Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses of $360 million to $376 million. We expect Q1 share-based compensation expense of approximately $61 million to $63 million. We anticipate Q1 non-GAAP EPS in a range of $3.35 to $3.85 per share. I will now pass the call back to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Cooper. Our immediate priority remains supporting customers as they evaluate and safeguard their environments. As we help our customers navigate this period, market dynamics are moving in a direction where F5 solutions are more essential than ever. The accelerated adoption of hybrid multi-cloud architectures and AI-driven infrastructure is driving demand for advanced application delivery and security solutions, areas where F5 is uniquely positioned to address our customers' most complex challenges.\nThe industry has platforms for end points, network access and for cloud workloads, but the F5 application delivery and security platform is the first to unify high-performance traffic management with advanced application and API security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments at scale. Unlike fragmented point solutions, the ADSP is purpose-built to simplify hybrid multi-cloud complexity. It integrates security, scalability and operational efficiency while enabling valuable [ XOps ] capabilities like policy management, analytics and automation. By the end of Q4, nearly 900 customers were leveraging XOps capabilities, up from just 20 in 2024.\nInnovations like our AI assistant and application study tool have been instrumental in driving this growth, which underscores the power and potential of the ADSP. Over the last several years, we also have been evolving our go-to-market strategy, focusing on landing, adoption, expansion and renewals within our solutions portfolio. This approach has delivered results. 26% of our top 1,000 customers are now using F5 distributed cloud services, up from 17% in 2024.\nBy delivering integrated solutions and accelerating customer outcomes, F5 is uniquely positioned to lead in a rapidly growing and dynamic market. I will speak to a few customer highlights from Q4 that demonstrate the power and the benefit of our holistic platform approach. An APAC-based bank is driving secure and scalable digital transformation with F5's comprehensive application delivery and security solutions. Leveraging F5 BIG-IP, NGINX and distributed cloud services, the bank is modernizing its critical infrastructure to enable 24/7 Internet banking and mobile application access while meeting strict regulatory requirements for service resilience and disaster recovery.\nF5 ensures business continuity and robust security protecting against DDoS attacks and API vulnerabilities. By enabling seamless migration to containerized applications, F5 is positioning the bank for hybrid multi-cloud success. A leading North American investment manager partnered with F5 to modernize its infrastructure and hence resilience and ensure uninterrupted operations. By migrating from legacy iSeries platforms to BIG-IP Next R-Series ahead of end of software support dates, the customer avoided compliance risks and ensured seamless operational continuity.\nThe customer also deployed F5 for secondary DNS services to reduce reliance on a single provider and deliver critical redundancy to prevent outages. F5's lightweight platforms and cloud solutions helped the customer optimize performance within existing budgets. Finally, a major energy and gas company partnered with F5 to modernize its critical infrastructure and drive its cloud migration while ensuring seamless security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\nF5's BIG-IP and distributed cloud services extend application delivery, security and identity management into hybrid multi-cloud environments, ensuring seamless operations and operational continuity. The customer is also leveraging F5's advanced WAF to strengthen the protection of revenue-generating B2B applications and business critical platforms.\nWith F5, the customer simplified operations, achieved cost savings and accelerated the modernization efforts. These examples highlight the strong impact F5's ADSP approach is having for our customers. While we continue to work towards realizing the platform's full potential, we are confident that our commitment to innovation will drive even more value and outcomes for our customers.\nBefore closing, I will highlight the traction we are building in AI use cases. We are seeing clear evidence that AI-related demand is contributing to our growth. AI is prompting a wave of data center refreshes as enterprises prepare for increased network capacity and services to support AI workloads, agentic AI and inferencing demands. Beyond benefiting from broader AI-driven trends, F5 is directly powering key AI use cases.\nIn FY '25, we secured AI use case wins with more than 30 customers who are leveraging F5 to enable seamless, scalable and secure AI workflows. These wins represent net new insertion points and growth opportunities built on decades of expertise. Today, we are actively supporting 3 critical AI use cases. Number one, AI data delivery. F5 secures and accelerates high-throughput data ingestion for AI training and inferencing and forcing policies and protecting sensitive data while eliminating bottlenecks.\nNumber two, AI runtime security, F5 safeguards AI applications, APIs and models from abuse, data leakage and attacks like prompt injection, ensuring visibility and control. And number three, AI factory load balancing, F5 optimizes traffic and GPU utilization in AI factories to increase token throughput, reduce time to first token and lower cost per token.\nIn Q4, we secured several new AI wins across these use cases. In an AI data delivery use case, an asset manager in EMEA partnered with F5 to overcome challenges in managing their AI workloads and ensuring reliable data performance. Their existing server could not handle high levels of demand, causing outages that disrupted operations. F5 provided a customized solution with advanced technology to improve systems reliability, efficiently manage data traffic and seamlessly work with their existing infrastructure.\nA government ministry in EMEA chose F5 to secure and scale AI security runtime operations for its AI-driven weather prediction platform, expanding on a prior AI data delivery project. The ministry required a comprehensive solution to ensure real-time access to AI-driven data with robust security for sensitive operations. F5 delivered a comprehensive solution suite, including [ AWAF ] for application security, SSLO for traffic infection, APM for access control and LTM for reliable data delivery. With F5, the ministry transitioned from manual inefficient forecasting to a secure, real-time AI-powered platform, improving performance, accuracy and operational efficiency.\nIn an AI factory load balancing use case, a North American service provider specializing in providing high-performance computing solutions for AI and machine learning workloads needed a high-performance solution to manage and scale AI workloads. They required enhanced scalability, reliability and accessibility for GPU-driven workloads as well as a proxy for container functions to optimize AI data pipeline performance. FI provided an integrated solution featuring container ingress services with BIG-IP virtual editions delivering a critical control layer for performance, scalability and reliability across AI data pipelines.\nF5's ease of installation and ability to address the customer's specific needs set it apart from competing open source alternatives. In Q4, we strengthened our AI runtime security capabilities with the acquisition of CalypsoAI. Their cutting-edge technology enhances our offerings with real-time threat defense and red teaming at scale, addressing critical needs for enterprises deploying generative and agentic AI. We are integrating these capabilities into our ADS-B, creating the most comprehensive solution for securing AI inference.\nIn fact, we launched 2 new offerings in Q4, leveraging Calypso's technology. F5 AI Guardrails establishes and monitors how AI models and agents interact with users and data, while defending against attackers. And F5 AI Redteam identify threats and informs exactly where and how urgently guardrails should be implemented.\nWasting no time, our team secured wins for these offerings with a top tier investment bank and a global AI compute platform leader. Collectively, our Q4 successes underscore F5's growing leadership in the hybrid multi-cloud landscape and the real value our platform approach delivers to customers, empowering them to simplify operations and hence security and accelerate innovation across their environments.\nI want to express my deepest gratitude to our customers and partners. Your urgency, collaboration and trust through every step of our incident response have been invaluable. We are truly honored to work alongside you and remain steadfast in our commitment to earn your confidence every single day. I also want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all [ F5ers ] who came together with incredible focus and dedication to drive a strong and effective response.\nLooking ahead, we are resolute in our commitment to emerge stronger from this experience and to working across the security community to build a better and safer digital world. In closing, I am deeply honored by the Board's appointment as Chair effective with Al Higginson's retirement in March 2026. As a Director for nearly 30 years and chair for 20, our leadership has been essential to F5's growth and transformation.\nHe has provided outstanding stewardship and [indiscernible] at the top that has shaped the F5 we are today. I am humbled by the Board's trust and confidence in me to help lead F5 through its next chapter. I look forward to working alongside this talented management team and the Board to continue F5's trajectory of creating long-term value for shareholders. Operator, Please open the call to questions."

Cooper will then review the details of our Q3 results and our outlook.\nI will now turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Our exceptional Q3 results highlight the strength of our business and F5's strong alignment with important secular trends. customers are modernizing their data centers, adopting hybrid multi-cloud architectures and scaling to meet growing application capacity and performance needs. .\nOur Q3 results demonstrate F5's position at the forefront of these transformative shifts. We delivered 12% total revenue growth, including 26% growth in product revenue our strongest in 14 years. This performance is a testament to our team's execution, our continued innovation and the enormous trust the largest enterprises and service providers across the globe place in F5. F5's unique ability to deliver and secure every app, every API anywhere on premises, in the cloud, at the edge and across hybrid multi-cloud environments is a significant competitive advantage. It powered strong demand across both hardware and software deployment models in Q3.\nOur systems revenue grew 39%, fueled by data center modernization, increased capacity requirements and adoption of our latest generation of hardware. Our software revenue grew 16%, driven by hybrid multi-cloud architecture adoption which is contributing to continued strong software subscription renewals and expansions. We continue to operate the business with discipline, combined with our strong revenue performance and continued operating margin leverage, we delivered exceptional EPS results in the quarter, reflecting 24% growth year-over-year.\nLooking ahead, our Q4 pipeline reflects continued strong demand in support of future forward architectures, data center modernization and an increasing range of application delivery and security services. As a result, we expect Q4 revenue in a range of $780 million to $800 million, implying approximately 9% revenue growth for FY '25. Cooper will provide a detailed overview of our Q3 performance and our outlook shortly.\nBefore that, I will highlight early traction with our F5 application delivery and security platform. I will also recap recent centric innovation and speak to some of our latest wins supporting AI workloads and infrastructure. We expect the long-term structural shifts driving data center modernization will persist continuing to reshape how companies invest in their IT infrastructure. Managing a skyrocketing number of apps and APIs across increasingly distributed environment is creating enormous challenges for IT teams and preparing for and implementing AI is only making it worse. At F5, we have made it our mission to dramatically simplify this complex array of operational and cybersecurity challenges with the F5 application delivery and security platform. While there are platforms for endpoints for network access and for cloud workloads, before the F5 ADSP, there was no platform that fully converges high-performance traffic management with advanced application and API security capabilities across hybrid and multi-cloud environment at scale.\nThe F5 ADSP is unique in that it enables customers to say, consolidate multiple delivery and security on solutions for applications and APIs on F5, leveraging a single platform with best-in-class capabilities; b, consistently deploy delivery and security across their hybrid multi-cloud environment by hardware, software and SaaS form factors; and c, dramatically simplify operations and reduce manual efforts by leveraging AI-powered analytics, insights and policy management. With these powerful benefits, it's no surprise that initial customer response is very positive. In Q3, we won a number of deals that demonstrate the power and the benefit of F5's platform approach. For example, North American health insurer chose F5 distributed cloud services and big IP, consolidating multiple security and delivery vendors across both its on-premises and SaaS environment, leveraging our unique hybrid multi-cloud approach, F5 is significantly reducing operational complexity while also providing enhanced security and improved API visibility.\nIn another example, an airline in our EMEA region selected F5 to modernize its application delivery and security posture. Already an F5 BIG-IP customer they faced escalating application growth and challenges securing a rapidly growing base of APIs across multi-cloud environment. After extensive competitive evaluation, they consolidated both their on-premises and SaaS environments on F5, replacing their incumbent SaaS provider and deploying F5 distributed cloud services with comprehensive WAP and secure multi-cloud networking. F5 is enabling the airline to securely connect and manage more than 100 B2B applications across multi-cloud environment, ensuring scalability, security and operational efficiency.\nIn a final example, a South American service provider consolidated all of its multi-cloud and on-premise security services on F5 through discovery during the sales process of what was initially a WAF-only opportunity, our team learned the full scale of the customers' challenges. The customer embraced the benefits of a unified F5 approach, consolidating their WAF bot protection and API security on F5 distributed card services. F5 is streamlining their operations, eliminating multi-vendor complexity and reducing cost by consolidating across all of its on-premises and multi-cloud environment. These examples underscore the significant value F5 delivers to customers through our ADSP. While there is still work ahead to unlock the full potential of the platform, we are confident that our ongoing innovation will enable us to deliver even greater benefits to our customers.\nOver recent quarters, we have been unveiling a suite of groundbreaking customer-centric innovations that showcase the power of the F5 ADSP while also highlighting how we are leveraging advanced AI technologies to enhance customer experiences and drive business growth. These innovations fall into 2 categories. The first is AI for ADC. These are innovations that leverage AI to reduce the operational complexity of delivering and securing applications in a hybrid multi-cloud world. These innovations empower customers to unlock the full potential of F5, simplifying deployment and accelerating their ability to scale F5 solutions seamlessly.\nThe second is ADC for AI. These innovations highlight how we are applying our strength in delivery and security to enable AI-driven applications. During Q3, we continued to make advances in both of these categories. In AI for ADC, we introduced advancements to our F5 AI assistant. Our goal is to make the F5 AI assistant an indispensable member of every NetOps and SecOps team. We are systematically building it around a simple, powerful loop, understand what's happening, prioritize what matters and act to solve it. to dramatically improve our customers' ability to understand potential threats and streamline prioritization, we are integrating technology from our Fletch acquisition. This integration will enable the F5 AI assistant to provide a real-time contextualized zoo of the threat landscape, along with proactive actionable recommendations that help cut through the noise. But insight without action is incomplete. That's why we enabled the assistant to act starting with its new ability to generate eye rules from a simple pump. This translates customer intent into secure performance code, making it easier for more customers to harness and leverage F5's unmatched programmability. This complete loop from deep understanding to automated action is how we move our customers from reactive fire fighting to proactive control.\nIn ADC for AI, we announced expanded capabilities for our F5 AI gateway to prevent data leaks and deliver cutting-edge AI data protection. Additionally, we introduced new functionality for F5 BIG-IP SSL Orchestrator to classify and defend encrypted data in motion and block unapproved AI use. Through industry-leading technology partnerships, F5 is also providing integrated secure and streamlined solutions to support complex emerging AI ecosystem. We recently announced advances with 2 of our AI-focused partners. In June, building on our prior work with NVIDIA, we announced we are expanding F5's performance, multi-tenancy and security capabilities for large-scale AI infrastructures. We are leveraging BIG-IP next for Kubernetes running natively on NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs. Feedback from customers who have tested the solution has been very promising. One customer reported an 18% increase in HTTP throughput and 11x improvement in time to first bite and 190x boost in network energy efficiency. Another customer reported a 20% improvement in GPU utilization. We believe this level of performance improvement could be meaningful to customers looking to scale and enhance performance of their AI infrastructure and we continue to work toward validating the solution with customers and NVIDIA.\nWith customers leveraging F5 to move incredible amounts of data at high speed, to and from data stores for AI modeling and inferencing, our work with storage partners is also critical. In July, we announced that we are deepening our alliance with [indiscernible] advancing our AI application and data delivery solution to manage training and inference-driven data growth. These innovations and partnerships highlight F5's role in enabling AI-driven applications. Today, dozens of leading enterprises are deploying F5 to ensure AI workflows operate flawlessly and scale seamlessly and remain resilient against evolving threats. These AI use cases represent net new insertion points for F5 and leverage technology and expertise built over a decade. Today, customers are leveraging F5 across 3 primary AI-related use cases.\nThe first is AI data delivery. In these use cases, customers are deploying F5 in front of data stores to ensure secure high throughput data ingestion for AI model training and inferencing. F5 is enforcing policy-based controls and eliminating bottlenecks, enabling performance delivery of massive data sets, while safeguarding sensitive information. The second is AI runtime security. In these use cases, F5 is protecting AI applications, APIs and models with F5 WAP and AI Gateway. F5 prevents abuse, data leakage and attacks like pump injection while ensuring full visibility and control over how AI models and applications interact across environment. The third is AI factory load balancing. In these cases, F5 is optimizing traffic both across and within AI factories.\nIn AI, performance is measured in terms of token throughput by intelligently distributing AI traffic to maximize GPU utilization, F5 AI factory load balancing directly increases token generation, reduces time to first token and lowers cost per token. In Q3, we secured several new AI wins. In an AI data delivery use case, a government institution in our EMEA region needed to dramatically accelerate data ingestion for its AI platform, but its existing infrastructure could not meet the throughput and traffic modification demand. The core challenge was processing data at 100 gigabits per second while performing intensive SSL decryption and inserting critical data for audit trails. To solve this, they placed high-performance F5 BIG-IP hardware in front of their S3 data stores. BIG-IP is able to perform SSL decryption at line rate while preserving critical data for auditing and policy enforcement. This combination of hardware-based decryption, intelligent traffic modification and robust traffic management allowed the institution to meet its demanding performance goals and build a scalable foundation for future AI workloads.\nIn an AI factory load balancing use case, an e-commerce provider based in our APAC region strategically deployed F5 BIG-IP and NGINX in key layers of their GPU as a service cloud platform. They use high-performance BIG-IP hard work to manage and secure the main entry point to their infrastructure, while F5 NGINX is embedded directly in front of each AI cluster to enforce fine grain authentication and authorization. This ensures that as their cloud scale, performance and security scale with it, enabling them to provide a foundational AI resource for their customers. Collectively, these successes underscore F5's expanding leadership in the hybrid multi-cloud landscape and the tangible value our platform approach delivered to customers and powering them to simplify operations, enhance security and accelerate innovation across their environment.\nNow I will turn the call to Cooper to elaborate on our Q3 results and our Q4 outlook. Cooper?\n\nCooper Werner\n\nSVP of Finance, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Francois, and hello, everyone. I will review our Q3 results before I elaborate on our Q4 and FY '25 outlook. As Francois noted, we delivered a strong Q3, growing revenue 12% to $780 million, reflecting a mix of 50% global services revenue and 50% product revenue. Global Services revenue of $392 million grew 1%, while product revenue of $389 million grew 26% year-over-year.\nOur software revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $208 million as customers continue to expand consumption and adopt additional capabilities across our platform. Our subscription-based software revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $185 million, representing 89% of our total software revenue. Perpetual license software totaled $23 million, down slightly year-over-year. Systems revenue totaled $181 million, up 39% year-over-year, with strength driven by tech refresh and data center modernization, including customers preparing for AI as well as competitive takeouts. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 73% of our Q3 revenue.\nOur recurring revenue consists of our subscription-based revenue and the maintenance portion of our global services revenue. Shifting to revenue distribution by region. Our teams drove growth across all theaters. Revenue from the Americas grew 13% year-over-year, representing 55% of total revenue. EMEA delivered 6% growth, representing 26% of revenue. and APAC grew 21%, representing 19% of revenue.\nLooking at our major verticals. Enterprise customers represented 70% of Q3's product bookings. Government customers represented 15% of product bookings, including 5% from U.S. Federal. Finally, service providers represented 15% of Q3 product bookings. Our continued operating discipline contributed to our strong Q3 operating results. GAAP gross margin was 81%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.1%. Our GAAP operating expenses were $435 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $381 million.\nOur GAAP operating margin was 25.2%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.3%, an improvement of more than 80 basis points year-over-year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.8%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14.4%. This includes a discrete benefit associated with the filing of our annual federal income tax return during the quarter. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $190 million, or $3.25 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $243 million or $4.16 per share, reflecting 24% EPS growth from the year ago period.\nI will now turn to cash flow and balance sheet metrics, all of which were very strong. We generated a record $282 million in cash flow from operations in Q3. CapEx was $9 million. DSO for the quarter was 42 days. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.44 billion at quarter end. Deferred revenue was $1.96 billion, up 10% from the year ago period. In Q3, we repurchased $125 million worth of F5 shares at an average price of $256 per share. As of the end of Q3, we had $1 billion remaining on our authorized stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we've repurchased shares equivalent to 52% of our annual free cash flow. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,540 employees. I will now speak to our Q4 outlook. With the exception of revenue, my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. As Francois noted, visibility into our Q4 pipeline and customer demand remains strong. We expect Q4 revenue in the range of $780 million to $800 million, implying 6% growth at the midpoint. We expect growth driven by tech refresh demand, data center modernization and adoption across our ADSP platform in support of customers' hybrid multi-cloud architectures. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 84% to 84.5%. We estimate Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of $376 million to $388 million. We expect Q4 share-based compensation expense of approximately $57 million to $59 million. We anticipate Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.87 to $3.99 per share.\nAs we look ahead to Q4 and beyond, we see customers increasingly leveraging both the breadth of our solutions across our portfolio and the flexibility only F5 offers to deploy in any form factor. As evident in our strong systems performance this year, customers' holistic hybrid multi-cloud approach spans hardware, software and SaaS deployments, and they are increasingly investing in high-performance hardware to address factors, including resiliency, data sovereignty and AI readiness. With that backdrop, I will recap the implications of our Q4 guidance on our fiscal year 2025 outlook.\nOur Q4 revenue guidance implies revenue growth of approximately 9% for FY '25. This is up from our prior guidance for growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and reflects robust systems revenue growth and software growth at or around 10% for the year. As implied by our Q4 guidance, we continue to expect FY '25 non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 83% to 84% and non-GAAP operating margin at or around 35%. We are adjusting our expected FY '25 non-GAAP effective tax rate to a range of 18.5% to 19.5% from the prior range of 20% to 22%. This change reflects the onetime benefit recorded in Q3. Our Q4 guidance implies FY '25 EPS in a range of 14% to 15% growth, up from our prior guidance of 8% to 10% growth. The increase is driven by the improvement in our revenue outlook and the benefit from the tax rate change. Finally, we expect our share repurchases for the full year to be at or above 50% of our free cash flow.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Cooper. F5 delivers and secures every app and API anywhere, on-prem, cloud, edge or hybrid environment, we lead in solving today's toughest business challenges. Our F5 application delivery and security platform is the first in the industry, offering consistent policies, full visibility and AI-driven insights.

Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call. During today's call, Francois will speak to our Q2 highlights and our strategy and growth opportunities. Cooper will then review the details of our Q2 results and our outlook.\nI will now turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. F5's continuous innovation, technology leadership and unique ability to solve our customers' hybrid multi-cloud challenges were key drivers of our strong Q2 results. We delivered 7% total revenue growth, including 12% product revenue growth. Systems revenue grew 27%, while software revenue was flat with the year ago quarter.\nWe also delivered Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $3.42, representing 18% year-over-year growth, $0.28 above the top end of our guidance range. Q2 strength reflects continued technology refresh momentum and expansion as customers leverage F5 to modernize their data centers, consolidate vendors and prepare for AI. We have good visibility into a Q3 pipeline that reflects continued healthy demand in support of data center modernization, competitive tick out momentum and a large available to renew software subscription base. As a result, we expect Q3 revenue in a range of $740 million to $760 million, implying roughly 8% growth at the midpoint. In addition, we are raising our guidance for FY '25 revenue growth to a range of 6.5% to 7.5%, up from our prior range of 6% to 7%. Our updated range reflects our strong first half revenue and the dynamics we are currently seeing in the business. Cooper will speak to our outlook in greater detail in just a few minutes. Before he does, I will highlight how we are innovating to address the ball of fire challenges faced by our customers, high cost, crushing complexity and escalating cyber risks.\nDuring Q2, we hosted our Up World event for customers and partners where we announced a number of exciting innovations. The most significant of these was the introduction of the F5 application delivery and security platform or the ADSP. The ADSP is the industry's only platform that fully converges high-performance load balancing and traffic management with advanced app and API security capabilities. While they are platforms for end points for network access and for cloud workloads, there hasn't been any platform that delivers and secures all apps and APIs across hybrid and multi-cloud environments at scale until now. With the F5's ADSP, we are enabling consistent policies, full visibility and AI-driven insights, all from a single platform that is flexible to deploy. We are delivering new capabilities that give CISOs the visibility compliance and protection they need to deliver and secure any app, any API anywhere. Crucially, we are providing powerful automation that helps customers manage large, complex digital estates with greater efficiency, reducing manual overhead, increasing agility and ensuring consistent enforcement across diverse environments. We are solving the ball of fire. The F5 ADSP provides comprehensive delivery and security for every app and API seamless deployment across any environment and form factor, unified management with a single, consistent policy framework, deep analytics and actionable insights, programmable data planes for maximum flexibility and end-to-end lifecycle automation.\nJust last week, we unveiled broad cybersecurity enhancements to the F5 ADSP. These enhancements significantly improve organization's ability to identify and remediate vulnerabilities and threats to AI and other modern applications. At Up World, we also unveiled a suite of groundbreaking customer-centric innovations that showcase the power of the ADSP, while also highlighting our commitment to leveraging advanced AI technologies to enhance customer experiences and drive business growth. These innovations fall into 2 categories. The first is AI for ADC. These are innovations that make it easier for customers to harness the power of F5. The second is ADC for AI. These innovations showcase how we are applying our strength in delivery and security to enable AI-driven applications, particularly inference workloads and model interactions. There are 3 innovations I will highlight in the AI for ADC category. The first is our rule cogenerator, which will be available later this year. Programmability and flexibility have always been at the heart of F5 success, and iRules are central to that value. The iRule cogenerator developed by our F5 AI center of excellence makes this programmability and flexibility more accessible than ever. This solution analyzes existing iRules and configurations to summarize their purpose, components and structure. It also generates new eye rules based on business or application requirements and optimizes existing iRules to boost performance reduced resource usage and accelerate delivery. With iRules cogenerator, customers can fully leverage F5's programmable capabilities with greater ease and sophistication.\nThe second AI for ADC innovation is expanding our AI assistant functionality across our product families. Today, more than 50% of our F5 distributed cloud customers use our AI assistant to better understand and operate their environments. At Up World, we expanded this functionality introducing AI assistant for NGINX One. And we announced the AI assistant for BIG-IP will launch later this year. These assistants empower customers with contextual intelligent guidance that reduces time to resolution, improves operational efficiency and enhances visibility across the stack. The third AI for ADC innovation, our new application study tool addresses the heightened awareness and focus on observability among operators, ensuring they can monitor and optimize performance with unprecedented clarity and precision. In an era where observability is mission-critical, our application study tool delivers unmatched visibility into app and API behavior. It offers deep insights into feature usage, application types quality of service and system utilization patterns, both average and peak. As one customer put it, this tool has given us insights we never thought possible. It's like turning on the lights in a room we've been navigating in the dark.\nMoving to ADC for AI. In Q2, we announced the general availability of the F5 AI gateway an offering that is purpose-built to secure and manage the new frontier of enterprise AI. As organizations embed generative AI into critical workflows, they need greater governance, visibility and control. That's where our AI gateway comes in. It inspects both prompts and responses to prevent data leakage and force policies and reduce the risk of unpredictable model behavior. The AI gateway market is just getting started, but we are seeing strong early interest in our solution, particularly with customers who need to scale AI adoption without compromising on trust or compliance.\nF5 is continuously innovating based on rapidly evolving market demands. We are already beginning to see the emergence of an genic future, one where AI systems don't just respond to prompt but operate as autonomous agents capable of completing tasks, collaborating with other agents and adapting over time. This shift is reshaping how applications are built and how infrastructure must respond. To support this evolution, we are expanding our platform with native support for the model context protocol or MCP, a foundational standard created by Anthropic and now being adopted by leaders like Open AI and Google. MCP enables agents and models to share memory, context and objectives across interactions, powering persistent multiturn reasoning and coordination. By bringing MCP support to BIG-IP, we are enabling our customers to route, observe and enforce policy across Agentic workflows, turning BIG-IP into a trusted control plane for AI agents operating at scale. As AI architectures shift from stateless queries to contextual autonomous systems, F5 is building the infrastructure foundation to support this next era of intelligent computing. Collectively, these advancements highlight F5's growing role in a hybrid multi-cloud landscape that is increasingly influenced by AI. Today, we continue to win AI use cases across 3 areas of high-performance data delivery and security. One, delivering and securing data used for both AI model training and inference. This is where F5 is deployed in front of data stores like our partner, NetApp; two, delivering and securing access to AI models for inferencing. This is where organizations are deploying F5 in front of AI models like Open AI, ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude; and three, AI factory load balancing both across AI factories and within AI factories as a result of partnerships, including our collaboration with NVIDIA. We are winning deals across all 3 use cases today.\nIn Q2, we secured several new AI wins including an AI gateway and F5 distributed cloud services win with a service provider in our APAC region. The customer aims to establish central governance controls and robust security guard rails within their AI infrastructure. By utilizing F5, they are protecting their ChatGPT interface from prompt injections and abuse while scaling cost effectively for multilingual customer support and ensuring compliance with government regulations.\nWe also secured a win with a North American-based retailer who is leveraging F5 BIG-IP to deliver responsive real-time AI-powered consumer voice interactions at scale. BIG-IP ensures fast, accurate and low latency performance by optimizing traffic and load balancing across the customers' GPUs, thus enabling seamless real-time decision-making and response. We are also delivering robust security features to protect sensitive consumer data and the scalability to handle growing AI workloads. In addition, in the second quarter, increased capacity demands with 2 existing AI customers drove expansion revenue.\nBefore I hand the call to Cooper, I will wrap up my prepared remarks with some examples of how customers are leveraging F5 to address their very real ball of fire challenges. I will categorize these across F5's 3 primary differentiators. First, F5 has the most effective and comprehensive application and API security platform in the industry. We enable our customers to consolidate point products, targeting specific threats onto a single integrated platform with a suite of best-in-class capabilities. Second, F5's hybrid multi-cloud strategy enables consolidation on a single vendor for app security and delivery. Only F5 delivers solutions that extend from customers on-premises environments across public clouds through the edge. F5 simplifies connecting disparate infrastructure environments and the applications deployed in and across them. And third, F5 solutions streamlined customers' operations with consistent policies, comprehensive automation and rich analytics. We enable customers to simplify their operational management across all environments. As an example of a customer win that resulted from our comprehensive app and API security, during Q2, we secured a win with a leading insurance company in our Lat Am region. The customer required a modern, flexible, scalable API security solution that could support their rapidly growing API landscape while also ensuring high availability between their main and secondary data centers. F5's hybrid approach strongly appeals to their needs and they deployed a combination of systems and SaaS deployment models with F5 BIG-IP and distributed cloud services.\nA standout example of F5's consolidation power came from a win with a major health insurer in our EMEA region. After initially pursuing a cloud-native strategy, the customer turned to F5 to consolidate and unify its security posture across its hybrid on-premises and cloud environment. The customer deploy BIG-IP hardware and software as well as WAP via distributed cloud services, resulting in greater operational efficiency and enhanced observability. Finally, representative of F5's ability to automate and streamline we landed a win with a large financial institution in our EMEA region. The customer is modernizing its network and needed a solution that provided scalability with enhanced security while also enabling them to automate using infrastructure as code. The customer is leveraging BIG-IP's automation capabilities to remove manual processes and life cycle risk. In addition, they are taking advantage of F5's BIG-IP scalability and distributed cloud services ability to support their multi-cloud strategies. F5 differentiated approach to hybrid multi-cloud also continues to drive competitive displacement momentum across our portfolio. For instance, during Q2, we successfully displaced a traditional ADC competitor at a leading North American insurance brokerage. F5 superior ADC capabilities and exceptional responsiveness capitalized on the customers' growing concerns about its incumbent provider, allowing us to secure a deal for F5 BIG-IP to support the customers' internal application and delivery solution.\nAlso in Q2, we underscored F5's value as a strategic partner to our customers, a North American-based service provider already an F5 customer, chose F5 to replace its longtime incumbent DDoS provider. This decision was driven not only by our robust DDoS capabilities, but also by our ability to consolidate multiple functionalities enabling the customer to streamline vendor management. Collectively, these wins highlight F5's growing role in a hybrid multi-cloud landscape that is increasingly influenced by AI.\nNow I will turn the call to Cooper to speak to our Q2 results and provide some additional color on our outlook. Cooper?\n\nCooper Werner\n\nSVP of Finance, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Francois, and hello, everyone. I will review our Q2 results before I elaborate on our Q3 and FY '25 outlook.\nAs Francois noted, we delivered a strong Q2, growing revenues 7% to $731 million and reflecting a mix of 54% global services revenue and 46% product revenue. Global Services revenue of $394 million grew 3%. Product revenue totaled $337 million, up 12% year-over-year due to strong systems growth. Our software revenue of $158 million was flat as Q2 had our smallest subscription renewal base of the year. subscription-based software revenue totaled $138 million, down 2% year-over-year, representing 87% of our total software revenue. Perpetual license software totaled $20 million in Q2, up 9% year-over-year. Systems revenue totaled $179 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our systems revenue is benefiting from a number of factors. First, customers continue to refresh aging hardware states. Similar to last quarter, we experienced widespread refresh activity in Q2 with strong customer demand across verticals and geographies. In addition, upcoming end of software support dates for our VIPRION and iSeries families are also driving reinvestment by customers. Combined, these families account for more than 50% of our installed base, representing a significant ongoing refresh opportunity.\nBeyond these F5's specific drivers and the mechanics of a normal refresh cycle, we believe there are several durable tailwinds benefiting our systems business. First, customers are building out their future hybrid multi-cloud architectures as they modernize and expand data centers. Second, customers are investing to prepare for AI. Third, we are driving continued competitive displacement and new customer wins as a result of our commitment to innovation. We believe all of these factors are contributing to our system strength and to our opportunity going forward. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 72% of our Q2 revenue. Our recurring revenue comes from a combination of our subscription-based revenue and the maintenance portion of our global services revenue.\nShifting to revenue distribution by region, our teams drove growth across all theaters. Revenue from the Americas grew 3% year-over-year, representing 54% of total revenue; EMEA delivered 20% growth, representing 29% of revenue, and APAC grew 3%, representing 17% of revenue. Looking at our major verticals, enterprise customers represented 69% of Q2's product bookings. Government customers represented 20% of product bookings, including 7% from U.S. Federal. Finally, service providers represented 11% of Q2 product bookings.\nOur continued operating discipline contributed to our strong Q2 operating results. GAAP gross margin was 80.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.1%, up 98 basis points year-over-year. Our GAAP operating expenses were $431 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $374 million. Our GAAP operating margin was 21.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.9%, an improvement of 103 basis points year-over-year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.1%. This reflects a onetime benefit recorded in Q2 related to foreign operations. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $146 million or $2.48 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $201 million or $3.42 per share, reflecting 18% growth from the year ago period.\nI will now turn to cash flow and balance sheet metrics, all of which remain very strong. We generated a record $257 million in cash flow from operations in Q2. CapEx was $11 million. DSO for the quarter was 47 days. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.27 billion at quarter end. Deferred revenue was $1.92 billion, up 6% from the year ago period. In Q2, we repurchased $125 million worth of F5 shares at an average price of $259 per share. As of the end of Q2, we had $1.2 billion remaining on our authorized stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have repurchased shares equivalent to 57% of our free cash flow. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,500 employees.\nBefore I speak to our outlook, let me touch on the topic of tariffs with respect to potential cost impacts as well as our supply chain. On the cost side, we have low tariff exposure across our systems business as the majority of our finished goods are USMCA compliant and are, therefore, duty-free on import into the United States from our Mexico-based contract manufacturing facility. Outside of our finished goods, we have a small amount of tariff exposure related to peripherals and other internal used goods imported from various countries. In total, we estimate our FY '25 tariff-related costs will be in the low single-digit millions, which we expect to offset through ongoing efficiency gains in our manufacturing and support operations. From a supply perspective, we do not expect any material impacts to lead times or availability as a result of our resilient and diversified global supply chain.\nI will now speak to our Q3 and full year outlook. With the exception of revenue, my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. As Francois noted, visibility into our Q3 pipeline and customer demand remains strong, and we are not seeing any direct signs of near-term demand erosion. Accounting for these factors, we expect Q3 revenue in the range of $740 million to $760 million, implying 8% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect growth will be driven by sustained strong demand for F5's solutions in support of data center modernization and strong software revenue growth, supported by a substantial subscription software renewal base in Q3. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 83% to 83.5%. We estimate Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses of $366 million to $378 million. We expect Q3 share-based compensation expense of approximately $57 million to $59 million. We anticipate Q3 non-GAAP EPS in a range of $3.41 to $3.53 per share.\nI will now speak to our fiscal '25 outlook. Balancing the strength we are currently seeing in the business with some prudence in relation to the macro environment, we are raising our revenue outlook for FY '25 to 6.5% to 7.5% growth, up from our prior range of 6% to 7%. This view incorporates our expectations that both systems and software revenue will grow double digits for the year. We continue to expect FY '25 non-GAAP gross margin in a range of 83% to 84% and non-GAAP operating margin at or around 35%. We are adjusting our expected FY '25 non-GAAP effective tax rate to a range of 20% to 22% from the prior range of 21% to 23%. This change reflects the onetime benefit recorded in Q2 related to foreign operations. We are raising our FY '25 EPS outlook to growth of 8% to 10%, up from our prior guidance of 6.5% to 8.5% growth. driven by the increase in our revenue outlook and the benefit from the tax rate change. Finally, we intend to continue to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow towards share repurchases in FY '25.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Cooper. Today, F5 is delivering the hybrid multi-cloud solutions our customers need. We are alleviating the high costs, crushing complexity and escalating cyber risks IT teams face in an increasingly AI-driven, hybrid and multi-cloud world.\nWith the recently introduced F5 application delivery and security platform, we are enabling consistent policies, full visibility and AI-driven insights all from a single platform that is flexible to deploy.

Cooper will then review the details of our Q1 results and our outlook.\nI'll now turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. We are really pleased to share our robust Q1 results with you today. F5's alignment with significant secular trends a more stable IT spending environment and our strong execution contributed to another record quarter. We delivered 11% total revenue growth, including 20% product revenue growth.\nSoftware revenue grew 22% and systems revenue grew 18%, with strength from all geographies. Our revenue outperformance also drove Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $3.84, a beat of $0.43 above the top end of our guidance range. The quarter strength is multifaceted and reflects a continuation of the trends we observed in the second half of last year. First, we are benefiting from consistently strong expansion of our software subscriptions, many of which have exceeded our expansion forecast. Second, with a more stable IT spending environment, new software demand continues to grow as customers resume transformative and modernization projects. And third, technology refresh activity is increasing, driving demand for both software and systems. Our pipeline shows these drivers will persist into Q2, contributing to our expectations for Q2 revenue in a range of $705 million to $725 million, implying roughly 5% growth at the midpoint. In addition, reflecting our Q1 outperformance and our better-than-expected Q2 forecast, we are raising our FY '25 revenue expectations to 6% to 7% growth up from our initial guidance of 4% to 5% growth. Cooper will speak to our outlook in greater detail in just a few minutes.\nBefore he does, I will spend a few minutes discussing F5's differentiation and highlighting some customer wins from Q1. Over the last several years, we have substantially reshaped F5 for the hybrid and multi-cloud architectures of the AI era. With all its advantages, hybrid multi-cloud also brings with it new challenges. IT teams are being overwhelmed by high-cost crushing complexity and escalating cyber risk a set of challenges we call the ball of fire. As AI becomes ubiquitous, it will add fuel to the ball of fire requiring more capacity to handle massive amount of data more sophisticated traffic management to deal with complex traffic patterns and enhanced security capabilities to stay ahead of new security threats. Unlike competitors who invested solely in cloud or SaaS, or significantly reduced investment limiting their applicability in a multi-cloud world, over the last several years, F5 innovated across hybrid SaaS and next-generation software and hardware. As a result, we stand alone with the only complete hybrid multi-cloud portfolio for application security and delivery. We are the only player that can partner with a CIO or CISO to secure and deliver all of their applications and APIs across hybrid, multi-cloud environment. We are differentiated across 3 primary vectors. First, F5 has the most effective and comprehensive application and API security platform in the industry. We enable our customers to consolidate point products targeting specific threats onto a single integrated platform with a suite of best-in-class capabilities. A notable example of the power of our ability to consolidate multiple security point products comes in the form of a significant Q1 renewal and expansion with a major financial services customer. Along with the anticipated renewal and expansion of its sizable BIG-IP and NGINX term subscription, the customer converted multiple security point solutions on to F5, adding SSLO and DDoS use cases. The result was a larger-than-expected expansion on what was already an 8-figure renewal. Second, F5's hybrid multi-cloud strategy enables consolidation on a single vendor for app security and delivery. Only F5 delivers solutions that extend from customers' on-premise environment across public clouds to the edge. F5 simplifies connecting disparate infrastructure environment and the applications deployed in and across them. In Q1, a regional utility company in North America modernized its BIG-IP application hosting, security and remote access infrastructure. The customer also deployed F5 distributed cloud services to support its modern applications displacing 2 F5 competitors and consolidating their traditional and modern applications and investment on F5. Third, F5 solutions streamlined customers' operations with consistent policies comprehensive automation and rich analytics. We enable customers to simplify their operational management across all environments. One of the largest private sector banks in APAC offers a great example of this dynamic. The customer has deployed F5's unified security policy displacing 2-point security competitors and consolidating on F5 for multiple use cases across their on-premises, public clouds, and Kubernetes environment, leveraging F5 in SaaS, software and hardware deployment models. F5 is vastly simplifying hybrid multicloud complexity for customers. By converging multiple point solutions to address high-performance traffic management, full web app and API security, multi-cloud networking and AI gateway capabilities, we are empowering customers with simplicity and choice. F5 enables them to tame the ball of fire with the right mix of hardware, software and SaaS that best fits their operating model, deploying securely and consistently on-premises in the cloud or at the edge.\nF5's differentiated approach to hybrid multi-cloud is also driving competitive displacement momentum across our full range of hardware, software and SaaS deployment models. In fact, in Q1, we achieved a record number of competitive displacement. These include a notable win with a home improvement retailer, following a series of escalating challenges with its incumbent ADC provider, the customer is replacing them with F5 BIG-IP leveraging BIG-IP's automation capabilities to support their application delivery infrastructure and to streamline operations. In another example of a competitive takeout in Q1, a leading American insurance provider and longtime BIG-IP customer chose F5 distributed cloud services to eliminate its growing security tools roll and reduced associated administrative burdens and cost. The customer is replacing their prior API protection provider with F5's distributed cloud services, web application and API protection or WAP solution. In doing so, they are enhancing their application and API security while consolidating tooling.\nBefore I pass the call to Cooper, as I have in prior quarters, I will discuss the latest developments we see emerging with AI. In the last year, organizations across the globe have embraced AI as a strategic imperative. We expect that within 3 years, 80% of applications and processes will be infused with AI. There is evidence of this ramp in our own business with more than 50% of our F5 distributed cloud customers already leveraging our AI agent, which provides configuration assistance and insights. While AI promises to bring massive productivity benefits, it is also creating new compliance, infrastructure, networking and security challenges for customers. AI is already exacerbating the ball of fire and accelerating the pressure to simplify hybrid multi-cloud deployments. Our early AI opportunities are concentrated on 3 areas of high-performance, data delivery and security. The dominant AI opportunity for F5 thus far is delivering and securing data for both AI model training and inference. AI model training requires higher performance traffic management to ensure the efficiency, speed and reliability of lengthy and expensive training processes. Customers are using F5 BIG-IP to move incredible amounts of data at high speed to and from their data stores, providing greater efficiency for the training process. AI inference is having a profound effect on infrastructure as well. When customers perform retrievable augmented generation or RAG as a part of inference, they see a sharp increase in the number of queries going to their data stores. As a result, these data stores experienced congestion and latency slowing overall infrastructure performance. By deploying BIG-IP in front of their data stores, customers are able to scale to handle the vast and increasing amounts of queries related to RAG. The result is improved availability and resiliency for their AI workloads. The second AI opportunity we see today leverages our market-leading WAP solution for secure AI inferencing. APIs connect the AI ecosystem and AI APIs are subject to the same security challenges and vulnerabilities as traditional APIs. F5's WAP solutions protect hybrid and multi-cloud applications with functionality that spans from API discovery to API security, which is essential for AI workloads. Customers are leveraging F5's complete security portfolio to protect their AI workloads, including BIG-IP, NGINX and F5 distributed cloud services. We expect secure AI inferencing will become a bigger opportunity for F5 as organizations move from experimenting to leveraging AI inferencing at scale. The third AI opportunity we are focused on is AI factory load balancing. Here, F5 is optimizing the performance and scalability of AI factories with advanced traffic management. We are doing this across AI factories and are working with partners toward deploying our solutions within AI factories. Across AI factories, customers deploying BIG-IP to improve the efficiency and performance of data going to and from massive GPU clusters. Within AI factories and as we described last quarter, we have partnered with NVIDIA to ensure BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes works seamlessly with NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs. The combination of F5 BIG-IP and NVIDIA's DPUs provides customers with improved performance, multi-tenancy and observability. While it is early, we are seeing growing momentum with AI opportunities. I will share just a couple of wins from Q1. The first is with a net new customer, a large mobility platform in APAC, who is using BIG-IP for high-performance data delivery. They selected F5 BIG-IP to support their robust AI computing stack addressing high-velocity load balancing for AI data ingestion and replacing costly public cloud infrastructure. F5's SSL performance and compatibility with AI protocols with orchestration was a major factor in winning this customer. The second Q1 AI win, I will highlight is with a leading multinational bank headquartered in our EMEA region. The customer selected F5 BIG-IP to secure, optimize and scale their AI application. They are leveraging BIG-IP for traffic management and WAF ensuring efficient distribution and security of their critical AI and data infrastructure with seamless integration with their existing infrastructure.\nNow I will turn the call to Cooper to elaborate on our results and outlook. Cooper?\n\nCooper Werner\n\nSVP of Finance, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Francois, and hello, everyone. I will review our Q1 results before I elaborate on our Q2 and fiscal year '25 outlook.\nAs Francois noted, we delivered an exceptional Q1, growing revenue 11% to $766 million, reflecting a mix of 52% global services and 48% product revenue. Global services revenue of $398 million grew 3%. Product revenue totaled $368 million, up 20% year-over-year due to a combination of strong software and systems growth. Our software revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $209 million, reflecting exceptional expansion in several large multiyear subscription renewals as well as healthy growth in new software projects. Subscription-based software revenue totaled $162 million, up 30% year-over-year, representing 78% of our total software revenue. Perpetual license software totaled $46 million in Q1, up 2% year-over-year. Systems revenue totaled $160 million, up 18% year-over-year. Our systems revenue is benefiting from a number of factors. First, technology refresh momentum is building as customers refresh aging hardware estates. The refresh activity is now widespread. In fact, some of the quarter's most significant demand came from customers outside of our top 1,000 customers. A second factor that has begun to accelerate the pace of refresh for many customers relates to upcoming end of software support dates for our VIPRION and iSeries families. Having gained clarity on the need for a balance of both hardware and software solutions in hybrid multi-cloud environments. Customers are moving forward with plans to standardize on our next-generation hardware offering. Lastly, our commitment to continuous innovation in both software and hardware is driving increased competitive displacement momentum and resulting in new customer wins. As we've discussed previously, we implemented a price increase on January 1, and we believe we did see a modest amount of systems orders pulled into Q1. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 72% of our Q1 revenue, reflecting 10% year-over-year growth. Our recurring revenue comes from a combination of our subscription-based revenue and the maintenance portion of our global services revenue.\nShifting to revenue distribution by region. As Francois noted, our teams drove growth across all theaters. Revenue from the Americas grew a strong 15% year-over-year, representing 56% of total revenue. EMEA grew 6%, representing 27% of revenue, and APAC grew 6%, representing 17% of revenue. Looking at our major verticals, enterprise customers delivered another very strong quarter, representing 71% of Q1's product bookings. Government customers represented 16% of product bookings, including 4% from U.S. Federal. Finally, service providers represented 13% of Q1 product bookings. We also delivered strong Q1 operating results driven by our robust revenue growth. GAAP gross margin was 81.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. Our GAAP operating expenses were $421 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $356 million. Our GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.4%, up 189 basis points from the year ago period. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.8%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $166 million or $2.82 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $227 million or $3.84 per share, reflecting 12% EPS growth from the year ago period.\nI will now turn to cash flow and balance sheet metrics, all of which remain very strong. We generated $203 million in cash flow from operations in Q1. CapEx was $8 million. DSO for the quarter was 57 days. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.16 billion at quarter end. Deferred revenue was $1.95 billion, up 6% from the year ago period, driven by our subscription software strength and very healthy maintenance renewals. In Q1, we repurchased $125 million worth of F5 shares at an average price of $255 per share. As of the end of Q1, we had $1.3 billion remaining on our authorized stock repurchase program. Our Q1 share repurchases represented 64% of free cash flow. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,440 employees.\nI will now speak to our outlook for Q2. With the exception of revenue, my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. We expect Q2 revenue in the range of $705 million to $725 million, implying 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. As a reminder, and as we noted on our October call, U.S. payroll tax resets and our large customer event in February, significantly impact our Q2 expenses. This results in it being our seasonal low quarter for both gross and operating margins. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82.5% to 83%. We estimate Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses of $362 million to $374 million. We expect Q2 share-based compensation expense of approximately $58 million to $60 million. We anticipate Q2 non-GAAP EPS in a range of $3.02 to $3.14 per share.\nIn light of our strong Q1 results and our Q2 guidance, I will also provide an update to our fiscal year '25 full year outlook. We are raising our FY '25 revenue growth forecast to a range of 6% to 7%. This is up from our initial guidance for 4% to 5% revenue growth and reflects our outperformance in Q1 and our healthy pipeline heading into Q2. Given our strong Q1 performance and continued strong expansion trends, we now expect our software revenue to grow at least 10% in fiscal year '25. This is up from the upper single-digit range we spoke to last quarter. We continue to expect FY '25 non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 83% to 84% and non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%. Our FY '25 non-GAAP effective tax rate estimate remains at a range of 21% to 23%. We are also raising our EPS outlook and now expect to deliver 6.5% to 8.5% non-GAAP earnings growth in FY '25, up from our prior guidance of 5% to 7% growth. Finally, we intend to continue to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow towards share repurchases in FY '25.\nWith that, I'll pass the call back to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Cooper. To conclude, we are benefiting from our alignment with powerful secular trends. Most significant among these is our unique ability to address the crushing complexity of hybrid multi-cloud. Unlike competitors who invested solely in cloud or SaaS or significantly reduced investment, we innovated across hybrid SaaS and next-generation software and hardware. We are reducing complexity for customers by converging multiple point solutions to address high-performance traffic management, full web app and API security, multi-cloud networking and AI gateway capabilities. We are empowering customers with simplicity and choice, enabling them to choose hardware, software or SaaS and to deploy securely and consistently on-premises, in the cloud or at the edge, and we believe we are increasing our opportunity as a result. It's early still, but we also see building momentum with AI opportunity. our industry-leading ability to rapidly and securely move the large amounts of enterprise data necessary for AI model training and inferencing positions F5 as indispensable as businesses start to implement AI at scale.\nOperator, please open the call to questions."

Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Suzanne DuLong. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nSuzanne DuLong\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and welcome. I'm Suzanne DuLong, F5's Vice President of Investor Relations. Francois Locoh-Donou, F5's President and CEO; and Frank Pelzer, F5's Executive Vice President and CFO, will be making prepared remarks on today's call. Other members of the F5 executive team are also here to answer questions during the Q&A session.\nA copy of today's press release is available on our website at f5.com, where an archived version of today's audio will be available through October 28, 2024. We will post the slide deck accompanying today's webcast to our IR site at the conclusion of our call. To access the replay of today's webcast by phone, dial (877) 660-6853 or (201) 612-7415 and use meeting ID13747602. The telephone replay will be available through midnight Pacific Time, July 30, 2024. For additional information or follow-up questions, please reach out to me directly at s.dulong@f5.com.\nOur discussion today will contain forward-looking statements, which include words such as believe, anticipate, expect and target. These forward-looking statements involve uncertainties and risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. We have summarized factors that may affect our results in the press release announcing our financial results and in detail in our SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will reference non-GAAP metrics during today's discussion. Please see our full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in today's press release and in the appendix of our earnings slide deck. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will speak to our Q3 highlights as well as our expectations for Q4. Frank will then review the details of our Q3 results and provide additional color on our outlook.\nWe delivered Q3 revenue of $695 million, which is at the top end of our revenue guidance range. We also delivered non-GAAP EPS of $3.36, and -- this is well above the top end of our guidance as a result of our continued operating discipline as well as some tax favorability in the quarter. Total software revenue grew 3% year-over-year and 13% sequentially.\nOur continued strong software renewals provide an indicator of both customer satisfaction and our momentum overall. In a positive shift from last quarter, during Q3, new software revenue also contributed to software growth in the quarter. Global Services grew 3% in Q3. And -- the combination of Software and Global Services growth largely offset systems revenue, which was $130 million, down 16% year-over-year.\nDuring Q3, we started to see some areas of improving demand after a prolonged period of budget scrutiny, evidenced by improving pipeline and close rates. As a result, our team drove strong bookings growth in Q3, including an uptick in new business. Factoring in these signals, we expect Q4 revenue in the range of $720 million to $740 million, which puts us on track to deliver towards the top end of our FY '24 revenue guidance.\nOur outlook is informed by 3 considerations: one, our growing pipeline; two, our visibility into software renewals; and three, the continued strong expansion trends from customers. We expect FY '24 revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, roughly flat with FY '23. This is despite the roughly $180 million systems backlog headwind we have had to overcome this year.\nGiven the strong performance from software thus far this year, and the good visibility we have into Q4, we now expect mid- to high single-digit software revenue growth for the year. This is up from our prior characterization of flat to modest growth. We also expect continued operating discipline combined with the tax favorability we saw in Q3, will enable us to achieve FY '24 non-GAAP EPS growth of approximately 12%. And -- this is up from our prior range of 7% to 9% growth.\nBefore Frank discusses our results and outlook in greater detail, I will recap how F5 is solving our customers' hybrid multi-cloud challenges, what we call the ball of fire, by highlighting some notable customer wins from the quarter. The current state of application security and delivery for large enterprises has our customers' IT teams in crisis. They are battling increasing complexity, cost and risks simultaneously, and AI-driven applications are only making these challenges more pronounced.\nOnly F5 can truly support the demands of today's hybrid multi-cloud application infrastructures. We are the only solution provider that secures, delivers and optimizes any app or any API anywhere. We are highly differentiated in addressing customers' pain points in several ways. First, app security, F5 delivers the most effective and comprehensive app and API security platform in the industry. We enable our customers to consolidate point products targeting specific threats onto a single integrated platform with a suite of best-in-class capabilities and no efficacy trade-offs.\nSecond, simplification. F5 enables the hybrid multi-cloud flexibility our customers' businesses demand with the simplicity their IT operations require. Only F5 has a solution footprint that extends across public clouds, to the edge and customers' on-premises environments. Our solutions simplify connecting disparate infrastructure environments and the applications deployed in and across them. In short, we are on a mission to make hybrid multi-cloud ridiculously easy.\nAnd third, standardization and automation, F5 delivers more cost-effective and scalable IT operations. We streamlined customers' operations with consistent policies, comprehensive automation and rich analytics. This enables customers to consolidate vendors and tool sets, rationalize operational silos and ultimate life cycle management of their on-premises deployments.\nThese 3 points of strong differentiation combined with the well-established role F5 plays embedded in the flow of application traffic enables us to extinguish the ball of fire for our customers in ways our competitors cannot.\nLet me review a few customer wins from Q3 that illustrate how F5 is differentiated and how our capabilities are delivering value for our customers. The first 2 customer examples I will speak to highlight our application and API security capabilities.\nDuring Q3, a U.S.-based security products and services company launched an effort to modernize its IT infrastructure. Specifically, the customer was looking to expand beyond hardware to a hybrid cloud and SaaS-based IT and security infrastructure. The customer was an existing BIG-IP customer and selected F5 Distributed Cloud services to complement its BIG-IP estate, creating a scalable, self-managed cloud and SaaS-based solutions.\nF5's portfolio of hardware, software and SaaS deployment options deliver standardized application and API security across their multi-cloud and hybrid environments, enabling them to modernize at their own pace.\nAlso during the quarter, a channel partner brought in F5 when a U.S. state government experienced a DDoS attack that brought down its servers. We quickly completed a successful emergency mitigation and deployed a suite of F5 solutions via Distributed Cloud services. When the threat actor changed tactics and launched application layer attacks, F5's operations team quickly activated WAF and Bot Defense and stopped them. As a result of F5's performance under pressure, the customer is moving additional services to F5, including their DNS and other web and application properties.\nBefore I move on to our next point of differentiation, I will take a minute to highlight that our continued innovation and industry-leading security performance is winning accolades from industry experts as well as customers. During the quarter, F5 was recognized as an application security leader by several independent parties. First, F5 is rated a leader in both security efficacy and operational efficiency in SecureIQLab's 2024 Cloud WAAP CyberRisk Validation Report. F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP earned SecureIQLab's Secure by Design rating, passing the WAAP vulnerability assessment with a perfect score.\nIn addition, Enterprise Management Associates singled out F5 as a visionary in API security for our Distributed Cloud web app and API protection or WAAP capabilities. In its vendor Vision 2024 report F5 is lauded for its holistic approach to API and application security, eliminating the need for customers to pay for and manage disparate API security solutions.\nAnd finally, KuppingerCole recognized F5 as a leader in web application firewall market, spotlighting F5 as a full runner that is setting the bar for excellence in cybersecurity defenses.\nThe next 2 customer wins I will highlight exemplify how F5 is enabling the hybrid multi-cloud flexibility our customers' businesses demand with the simplicity their IT operations require. They both also happen to be examples of our continued momentum against competitors.\nDuring the quarter, a U.S.-based technology company that delivers a web and video collaboration platform selected F5 to replace its incumbent ADC provider. The customer will use BIG-IP, including WAF and DNS capabilities, to consolidate and standardize their infrastructure across their on-premises and third-party data centers. F5 was selected because of our software and hardware deployment options, the efficacy of our advanced WAF and our flexible commercial models. I will note that this also was a land and expand win. In 2020, we displaced a competitor for DDoS protection.\nIn another example from the quarter, the large APAC-based travel agency selected F5 Distributed Cloud to enable it to address multiple challenges simultaneously. Initially, the customer was looking to streamline app delivery through a single abstract layer. In the process of proving its capabilities for this use case, F5 Distributed Cloud outperformed the incumbent security provider. As a result, the customer consolidated on F5, enabling them to stage application migration to new data centers while minimizing disruption and risk.\nIn addition, Distributed Cloud's SaaS console and comprehensive observability features, drastically reduced operational overhead for the customer.\nThe final 2 customer wins I will speak to highlight how we streamline customers' operations with consistent policies, comprehensive automation and rich analytics. During Q3, our team secured a large land and expand deal that was 18 months in the making. The customer is a global retail and investment bank with an extensive branch network.\nBanking regulations require them to separate segments of their IT environments. To accomplish this, they are building a new virtualized network to run in parallel to their existing environment. they selected BIG-IP software to augment their existing BIG-IP footprint. They also upgraded to NGINX Plus from NGINX open source. BIG-IP's automation capabilities enable them to implement automation best practices across the board, saving time and reducing the potential for human error.\nThey are now able to operationalize multiple BIG-IPs in just 20 to 30 minutes versus the days or, in some cases, even weeks required previously. In addition, NGINX Plus delivers reliable and secure access to their Kubernetes applications and enables a consistent security posture across all of their application environments.\nThe final example from the quarter I will highlight is with a global automotive company. This customer is an existing BIG-IP customer who is renewing and expanding their BIG-IP subscription for the second time. The customer is leveraging BIG-IP's automation capabilities to enable self-service application delivery and security services in seconds compared to the weeks or months it took previously.\nBIG-IP has significantly accelerated this customer's time to market for both internal and external customers. The value of BIG-IP's automation capabilities is so significant to them that their consumption has doubled with each renewal.\nBefore I pass the call to Frank, I will close with some brief commentary about how we are enabling AI, shaping the AI revolution and working with customers to ensure they are AI ready.\nDuring Q3, we continued to engage with several of our major customers focusing on their AI initiatives and collaborating to address their critical AI-related challenges. Two pivotal trends have emerged from these interactions. First, the largest organizations, which are building AI factories are starting to recognize that high-performance networking and security are nonnegotiable for both model training and inference.\nSecond, organizations that are using foundational AI models for inference use APIs extensively. This use case also demands top-tier performance and robust security. In both scenarios where the constructing AI factories for model training or executing inference, F5's leading ADC platform and our distinctive capabilities in application security and delivery will have an important role to play. We are seeing and winning early AI use cases.\nAs an example, a global automotive company selected F5 BIG-IP to rapidly and securely transfer data from data storage systems to large-scale clusters, significantly accelerating their model training process. For retrievable augmented generation use cases like this, our solutions are optimizing the performance of AI models as they access and incorporate external data sources in real time.\nSeparate from this customer, our entire product family is being utilized by other customers to load balance and protect AI-related API traffic. In the AI era, all communication is happening via APIs, which are increasingly distributed, running on-premises in private clouds and across multiple public clouds.\nF5's Distributed Cloud services is an ideal solution for organizations needing consistent management and security for their distributed AI APIs. Leveraging our long-standing partnerships with semiconductor leaders, we also are strategically positioned to advance these relationships in the AI era.\nOur approach remains technology-agnostic, focusing on solving real-world practical AI challenges for customers. Realistically, we expect we are probably 1 to 2 years out from enterprises deploying AI in production at scale. Importantly though, F5 is not just adapting to the AI revolution, we are actively shaping it, providing the critical infrastructure that enables our customers to harness the full potential of AI safely and efficiently.\nNow I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q3 results before I elaborate on our Q4 outlook. We delivered Q3 revenue of $695 million, with a mix of 56% Global Services and 44% product revenue. Global Services revenue of $387 million grew 3%, and -- in line with our expectations, which reflected lapping the benefit of prior price increases. .\nProduct revenue totaled $308 million, down 6% year-over-year due to a lower level of backlog-related systems shipments than a year ago quarter. Systems revenue of $130 million demonstrates a slowing decline of 16% year-over-year. Software revenue totaled $179 million, representing 3% year-over-year growth and 13% sequential growth. Subscription-based revenue contributed $155 million or 87% of total software revenue, representing 2% growth year-over-year and 10% sequential growth.\nSubscription renewals remained strong in Q3 with continued solid expansion in our multiyear agreements. An exception to this trend is our Bot Defense point solution where the majority of customers are renewing, but some are opting for less sophisticated lower-cost options. Rounding out our software revenue, perpetual software contributed $24 million. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 77% of Q3's revenue, up from 75% a year ago. Recurring revenue includes the subscription-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our global services revenue.\nOn a regional basis, revenue from Americas was down 4% year-over-year, representing 55% of total revenue. EMEA delivered a strong quarter with 5% growth, representing 27% of revenue. APAC declined 1%, representing 18% of revenue.\nLooking at our major verticals, enterprise customers delivered another strong performance, representing 67% of product bookings in the quarter. Government customers also performed well, representing 21% of product bookings, including 7% from U.S. Federal. Finally, service providers represented 12% of Q3 product bookings.\nOur Q3 operating results were strong, reflecting our continued operating discipline. GAAP gross margin was 80.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.1%, and -- an improvement of approximately 65 basis points from Q3 and FY '23. Our GAAP operating expenses were $396 million, our non-GAAP operating expenses were $346 million. Our GAAP operating margin was 23.4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, reflecting an improvement of approximately 20 basis points from Q3 of FY '23. We -- our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.5%. Similar to Q3 of last year, the lower-than-expected tax rate reflects a nonrecurring benefit associated with filing our annual federal income tax return during the quarter.\nOur GAAP net income for the quarter was $144 million or $2.44 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $199 million or $3.36 per share.\nI will now turn to cash flow and the balance sheet, which also remained very strong. We generated $159 million in cash flow from operations in Q3. CapEx was $6 million. DSO for the quarter was 54 days, in line with 51 days in Q2. We -- Cash and investments totaled approximately $943 million at quarter end. Deferred revenue was $1.77 billion, down 1% from the year ago period. The change is due to a higher weighting of our sales to term-based subscriptions and a corresponding lower allocation of bookings to deferred revenue.\nIn addition, we are lapping price increases on maintenance renewals. We also have implemented some strategic go-to-market decisions, including no longer incentivizing customers towards multiyear maintenance agreements.\nOur share repurchases reflected our ongoing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased $150 million worth of F5 shares in Q3 at an average price of $172 per share. Year-to-date, we have used approximately 77% of our free cash flow towards share repurchases, far in excess of our commitment to direct at least 50% of free cash flow towards share repurchases. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,500 employees.\nI will now speak to our outlook for Q4. We -- we expect Q4 revenue in the range of $720 million to $740 million on the strength of our software renewals and a slight uptick in new business momentum. We expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 83%. And -- we estimate Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of $350 million to $362 million. We are targeting Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.38 to $3.50 per share. We expect Q4 share-based compensation expense of approximately $54 million to $56 million.\nOur Q4 guidance implies some positive updates to our prior outlook for FY '24. We -- we expect approximately $2.8 billion in revenue for the year. Embedded in this is the expectation for mid- to high single-digit software revenue growth, up from the flat to modest growth expectation we had at the start of the year. We now expect our FY '24 non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in the range of 19.5% to 20%, down from our prior range of 20% to 22%.\nWith the combination of revenue growth, continued operational discipline and a tax rate that is improving compared to our prior expectations, we now expect FY '24 non-GAAP EPS growth of approximately 12%. The -- this is up from our prior expectations of 7% to 9% growth. We are not revising our gross or operating margin targets for FY '24 and continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins in the range of 82% to 83%, and -- which would reflect an improvement of 50 to 150 basis points from FY '23.\nWe also continue to expect non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 33% to 34%, and -- which would reflect an improvement of 280 to 380 basis points from FY '23.\nBefore I pass the call back to Francois, I wanted to share some personal news. I've made the decision to retire from F5. I joined F5 in 2018 to help the team navigate a massive transition from a hardware-led company to one that was more software-led. Delivering our Q4 guidance will make FY '24 and -- the third consecutive year where software revenue is the majority of our product revenue, signaling that we have, in fact, successfully completed that transition. I plan to remain with the team as CFO through the filing of our FY '24 10-K likely in mid-November.\nCooper Werner, who is currently our SVP of Finance, is slated to take over as CFO upon my departure. Many of you know Cooper well. He has been with F5 for 23 years, during which he has consistently taken on new responsibilities as F5 has grown and changed. He has been SVP of Finance for the last 12 years, managing our FP&A, real estate procurement and trade organizations, His extensive financial expertise and institutional knowledge have been pivotal in guiding our business model as we have executed our software transformation. Cooper is a strong and engaging leader, and we expect him to be a great addition to the executive leadership team. I will continue to work with the team between now and November to ensure a smooth transition.\nWith that, I'll pass the call back to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Frank. I truly cannot thank you enough for your partnership and counsel over the last 6 years. You have been an integral part of our executive leadership team with an immeasurable impact on F5. Your deep knowledge of software and SaaS-led businesses was instrumental to F5's successful transition to a software-led company. You have been a tireless advocate for F5, our business and our employees and an extraordinary partner and friend. I know it's not goodbye at this point, but I really want to thank you here and now. I will also echo your comments about Cooper. I have worked very closely with Cooper and my tenure at F5 and have enormous confidence in his ability to succeed you in the CFO role.\nIn conclusion, I will reiterate that F5 is uniquely positioned to help our customers as they move forward in a hybrid and multi-cloud reality that brings with it untenable operational complexity, considerable cost and escalating security risks. As large enterprises across the globe are modernizing their IT infrastructures and driving IT cost optimization, they also are developing comprehensive AI strategies for their businesses.\nF5 is proving itself an invaluable partner in this modernization process and enabling our customers to ready their IT infrastructure to leverage AI at scale. F5 is optimizing application security, delivery, management and performance across hybrid multi-cloud environments with enhanced automation and meaningful operational efficiencies.\nWe -- going forward, and especially as we enter the era of AI-driven applications, we believe customers will require a hybrid SaaS platform that covers all of their app security and delivery needs regardless of form factor. This is the world we have invested for, and as customers gain more confidence in their IT budgets and priorities, we believe we are well positioned to capture our share of their spend.\nOperator, please open the call to questions."

Please see our full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in today's press release and in the appendix of our earnings slide deck. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In my remarks today, I will speak to our Q2 highlights as well as our expectations for Q3 in FY '24. Frank will then review the details of our Q2 results and provide additional color on our outlook.\nOverall, customers remain cautious as a result of lingering macroeconomic concerns and what currently looks like generally flat IT budgets for calendar 2024. Against this backdrop, we delivered a solid Q2 with revenue near the midpoint of our guidance range. Our software subscription renewals continued to perform well, driving 20% total software revenue growth compared to a year ago, including 28% subscription revenue growth.\nWe also delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 15% with EPS of $2.91 per share at the high end of our guidance range. As we look into our second half, we remain on track to deliver on our FY '24 revenue outlook. We expect continued strong performance from our software subscription renewals and our renewals base provides good visibility into the back half of FY '24. We also remain committed to continued operating discipline, and we are raising our FY '24 non-GAAP EPS outlook to a range of 7% to 9% growth from our prior range of 6% to 8% growth. Frank will discuss our outlook in greater detail in a few minutes.\nBefore he does that, I will spend a few minutes speaking to the hybrid multi-cloud ball of fire our customers' IT teams are living in, explaining F5 differentiation in addressing this ball of fire and highlighting some notable customer wins from Q2. The current state of application security and delivery for large enterprises has IT teams in crisis. The increasing complexity and the associated cost and risk they are battling is not incremental. It is untenable, and it is growing even more so by the day.\nJust a few years ago, customer believed that by now, their applications would be consolidated in the public cloud. Instead, today, they are grappling with a more complex and costly set of challenges than ever before. 88% of our customers report they are currently operating applications across a combination of on-premises and cloud environments. On average, organizations are operating across 4.5 different types of environments. Most organizations have hundreds of applications, each with a set of associated APIs distributed across these multiple environments.\nAnd because modern applications have decomposed monolithic applications into smaller components, those components are more fragmented and distributed. As a result, APIs and data also are more distributed. The result of this expansion and distribution is amplified security risks across a larger attack surface area. These challenges will be further intensified by the inevitable widespread adoption and proliferation of AI.\nThis complexity is preventing organizations from operating at the speed their businesses demand. Manual tasks, inconsistent security controls, operational silos, lack of available talent escalating cloud costs and inefficient traffic routing are slowing them down. We have affectionately named this set of escalating challenges, the ball of fire.\nDuring Q2, we spoke with more than 1,600 customers and partners about the ball of fire at our Global AppWorld events. These events gave us the opportunity to explain how our distributed app security and delivery platform can mitigate customers ball of fire challenges. We have significantly expanded and evolved our solutions portfolio over the last several years. Today, only F5 can truly support the demands of today's hybrid multi-cloud application infrastructures. More specifically, we are the only solution provider that secures, delivers and optimizes any app, any API anywhere.\nF5 is highly differentiated in addressing customers' pain points in this ball of fire in several ways. First, app security. F5 offers the most effective and comprehensive app and API security platform in the industry. While several providers offer point products for specific threat vectors, F5 has built an integrated and comprehensive suite of best-in-class capabilities, all delivered through a single platform. Why does this matter to our customers? Because our customers can consolidate solutions addressing all of their app security needs with a single platform and without making trade-offs on efficacy.\nSecond, simplification. We make hybrid multi-cloud ridiculously easy. Only F5 has a solution footprint that extends to all environments in the ball of fire, including public clouds, at the edge and customers' on-prem environments. F5 radically simplifies the work of connecting these disparate infrastructure environments as well as the applications deployed in and across them. Why do customers care about this? Because we enable the hybrid multi-cloud flexibility their businesses demand with the simplicity their IT operations require.\nAnd third, sterilization and automation. F5 uniquely streamlines customers' operations with consistent policies, comprehensive automation and rich analytics. This enables customers to consolidate vendors and tool sets, rationalized operational silos and automate life cycle management of their on-premises deployments. The result is far less toil for NetOps, SecOps, and DevOps teams. Why does this matter to customers? Because it results in more cost-effective and scalable IT operations.\nIt is the combination of these 3 points of strong differentiation along with the role that F5 plays embedded in the flow of application traffic that create F5's unique position and enable us to extinguish the ball of fire for our customers. We empower our customers to run at the speed their businesses demand. Let me offer a few customer examples from Q2 to illustrate how these capabilities are manifesting today in our customers' real-world use cases.\nThe first 2 customer examples I will speak to highlight our application security capabilities. The first example is an API security use case. Last quarter, we spoke to the substantial increase we are seeing in the volume of API targeted attacks. Customers tell us API security is one of their most significant concerns and with good reason. APIs represent a critical avenue for attack, potentially exposing back-end systems and data. We foresaw this API crisis coming and last year, launched a comprehensive and AI-ready API security solution available via F5 Distributed Cloud Services.\nOur differentiation stems from our ability to go beyond API discovery through traffic analysis. In addition, we performed continuous monitoring, code scanning, API testing analysis, threat surface mapping and enforcement. We do all of this in a holistic easy-to-deploy solution that provides complete visibility, architectural flexibility and management through a single pane of glass. During Q2, a large multinational networking and telecommunications company needed a solution to mitigate an explosive rise in API and web application attacks on its digital wallet solution.\nThis solution supports more than 400 million wallets across 24 countries, processing over 2.8 billion transactions worth more than $40 billion every month. To protect their consumers' financial transactions on a global scale, this use case demanded the highest level of app and API security efficacy with no trade-offs on performance. The customer is standardizing on F5's Distributed Cloud Services, application and API security as the basis for its new industry network and API security globally, ensuring coverage for new markets worldwide with heightened security for financial transactions.\nThe second app security example is a bot mitigation use case. In Q2, a multinational beverage company leveraged our Distributed Cloud Services platform for advanced bot mitigation. During a proof of concept, F5 solution discovered 99% of the customers' traffic was coming from bots and it blocked millions of fragile [ independence ]. As a result, the customer deployed F5 across its branded marketing and consumer-facing sites and thus far, has saved near $3 million in fraud. This deployment is also an example of the success of our land and expand strategy as the customer previously deployed F5 for load balancing and WAF.\nThe next customer win I will highlight exemplifies how F5 is able to simplify connecting disparate infrastructures, making hybrid multi-cloud ridiculously easy for our customers. An energy company in our APAC region selected a combination of big IP VELOS hardware and distributed cloud services to improve application security and scalability while also driving operational efficiency and reducing costs. Following the acquisitions of several companies, the customers wanted a new shared infrastructure that united their disparate on-premises operating environment and position them to move to the cloud.\nUltimately, this customer opted to consolidate multiple vendors on to F5, leveraging our hardware and SaaS offerings. The final 2 customer wins I will highlight demonstrate how we streamline customers' operations with consistent policies, comprehensive automation and rich analytics. During Q2, an American auto insurance provider selected F5 Distributed Cloud Services to increase their business velocity through automation. The customer faced the ball of fire.\nThe evolution of their multi-cloud infrastructure led to tool fragmentation, inefficient modern application deployment, inconsistent security and the lack of manageability and visibility. The customer evaluated several point solutions in addition to F5's platform approach. We demonstrated our ability to improve velocity through automation, while also providing consistent and more effective app security and faster response times. The customer ultimately consolidated on to F5 replacing their existing WAF provider with distributed cloud services.\nIn another example from Q2, a multinational bank and financial services company expanded their F5 BIG-IP footprint. Leveraging both software instances in public clouds and hardware and traditional data centers, F5 is enabling a fully automated self-service ADC and security solution for all of their load balancing and firewall needs. As a result, the customers speed of provisioning new application services have gone from weeks to minutes, and F5 has captured a 2x increase in spend over the last 5 years.\nBefore I pass the call to Frank, I will close with some brief commentary about how we are innovating to target and capture emerging AI opportunities. There is no question that AI will accelerate the growth in the number of applications and APIs. It will also exacerbate the ball of fire. Last quarter, we spoke about F5 as an AI enabler and discussed some early use cases where customers are deploying F5 in support of AI initiatives.\nIn addition to innovating and evolving our portfolio to ensure we are optimizing for AI, we also are engaging customers in architectural discussions about the AI readiness of their environment. We already are working with customers on 3 specific AI-related challenges. The first is API security because API security is AI security.\nAs APIs proliferate, for example, through the adoption and deployment of AI services for inferencing, there is a critical need for a solution that automatically discovers and secures those endpoints. As I mentioned earlier, F5 has the most comprehensive AI-ready API security solution available today by our F5 Distributed Cloud Services.\nThe second AI-related challenge is secure multi-cloud networking. With increasingly distributed applications and APIs, customers need high throughput connectivity across on-premises, cloud and edge for AI inference. Distributed cloud services is unmatched in its capabilities to connect, secure and manage distributed apps and APIs across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\nThe third AI-related challenge is high-speed data ingestion. In use cases where customers want to ingest data for multibillion parameter AI models, they need high-performance low balancing, and no one is better at high throughput load balancing than F5. We expect that enterprise is broadly renting AI adoption over the next 1 to 2 years will bring a host of additional AI fuel use cases for F5 solutions. Our platform approach, our continuing innovation and our role in the line of traffic of millions of applications that will ultimately leverage AI puts us in a unique position to partner with customers as they work to solve both current and future AI challenges.\nNow I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q2 results before I elaborate on our Q3 and FY '24 outlook. We delivered Q2 revenue of $681 million, reflecting sales that were down 3% year-over-year with a mix of 56% global services and 44% product revenue. Global services revenue of $381 million grew 5%, in line with our expectations, which reflect our lapping the benefit of prior price increases.\nProduct revenue totaled $300 million, down 12% year-over-year, reflecting a lower level of backlog-related systems shipments than the year ago quarter. Systems revenue of $142 million declined 32% year-over-year. Total software revenue grew 20% over the year ago period to $159 million. Subscription-based revenue contributed $140 million or 88% of the total software revenue representing growth of 28% from last year.\nWithin subscriptions, renewals were strong. As expected, demand for new subscriptions were flat year-over-year, given customers' current spending caution on new projects. Rounding out our software revenue, perpetual software contributed $18 million. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 75% of Q2's revenue, up from 65% a year ago. Recurring revenue includes subscription-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our global services revenue.\nOn a regional basis, revenue from Americas grew 1% year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA declined 6%, representing 26% of revenue, and APAC declined 9%, representing 17% of revenue. Looking at our major verticals, we saw relative strength from enterprises with enterprise customers representing 69% of product bookings in the quarter. Government customers performed well, representing 19% of product bookings, including 7% from U.S. Federal.\nFinally, following the strong Q1, service providers represented 13% of Q2 product bookings. Our Q2 operating results reflect the usual seasonal patterns as well as our continued operating discipline. GAAP gross margin was 79.3%, non-GAAP gross margin was 82.1%, an improvement of approximately 170 basis points from Q2 of FY '23. As expected, our operating expenses ticked up in Q2, given payroll tax resets as of January 1 as well as costs associated with our Global AppWorld events.\nOur GAAP operating expenses were $400 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $349 million. Our GAAP operating margin was 20.5%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.9%, reflecting an improvement of approximately 370 basis points from Q2 of FY '23. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $119 million or $2 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $173 million, up approximately 13% from Q2 of FY '23. Our non-GAAP EPS was $2.91 per share, up approximately 15% from Q2 of last year.\nI will now turn to cash flow and balance sheet, which also remained very strong. We generated $222 million in cash flow from operations in Q2, up 57% from $141 million in the year ago period. The significant increase is largely the result of an increase in cash received from customers and the timing of collections compared to billings.\nCapEx was $9 million. DSO for the quarter was 51 days, down from our unusually high 67 days in Q1 and reflecting our improved product availability and a return to normalized shipping linearity, which supported strong cash collections. Cash and investments totaled approximately $910 million at quarter end. Deferred revenue was $1.81 billion, up 1% from Q2 of FY '23.\nOur share repurchases reflect our ongoing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased $100 million worth of F5 shares in Q2 at an average price of $184 per share. Year-to-date, we have used approximately 68% of our free cash flow towards share repurchases. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,450 employees. I will now speak to our outlook for Q3 and our updated view on our FY '24 outlook.\nFirst, I will speak to Q3. We expect Q3 revenue in the range of $675 million to $695 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margins in the range of 82% to 83%. We estimate Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses of $340 million to $352 million. We are targeting Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.89 to $3.01 per share. We expect Q3 share-based compensation expense of approximately $55 million to $57 million. I will now turn to our FY '24 outlook.\nWe have good visibility to and confidence in our subscription renewals in our second half. This visibility leads us to expect our second half of FY '24 will be stronger than our first half, reflecting the cyclicality associated with the timing and cadence of our subscription renewals. Our outlook does not assume a significant improvement in macro environment.\nAs Francois mentioned, we expect FY '24 revenue growth that is flat to down 2% from FY '23. This outlook is consistent with our prior FY '24 revenue outlook, albeit with more specificity on the range given we're halfway through the year. We are not revising our gross or operating margin targets for FY '24 and continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins in the range of 82% to 83%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 33% to 34%.\nWe now expect our FY '24 tax rate will be in the range of 20% to 22%, a slightly wider range than our prior estimate of 21% to 22%. Finally, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS growth expectations. We now expect FY '24 non-GAAP EPS growth between 7% and 9%. This is up from 6% to 8% range we provided last quarter.\nI will now turn the call back to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Frank. In conclusion, F5 predicted the hybrid multi-cloud [ ball of fire ] crisis our customers now face. For the last several years, we have been innovating and evolving to create the industry's first distributed application security and delivery platform.\nToday, we are the only provider capable of securing, delivering and optimizing any application, any FPI regardless of its location, be it in a data center, any one of the public clouds, as SaaS or at the network edge. Today's hybrid and multi-cloud reality brings with it untenable operational complexity, considerable cost and escalating security risks. Broad-based enterprise adoption of AI will only compound these challenges.\nF5's 3 points of differentiation, best-of-breed app security, our ability to simplify connecting disparate infrastructures and our ability to streamline operations through standardization and automation set F5 apart from the alternatives. When combined with the role we play in the line of application traffic, these differentiators position us to extinguish the ball of fire for our customers empowering them to run at the speed their businesses demand.\nOperator, please open the call to questions. Thank you."

First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Ms. Suzanne DuLong. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nSuzanne DuLong\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and welcome. I'm Suzanne DuLong, F5's Vice President of Investor Relations. François Locoh-Donou, F5's President and CEO; and Francis Pelzer, F5's Executive Vice President and CFO, will be making prepared remarks on today's call. Other members of the F5 executive team are also on hand to answer questions during the Q&A session. A copy of today's press release is available on our website at f5.com, where an archived version of today's audio will be available through April 28, 2024.\nThe slide deck accompanying today's discussion is viewable on the webcast and will be posted to our IR site at the conclusion of our call.

Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call. With that, I will turn the call over to François.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In my remarks today, I will speak to our Q1 highlights as well as our expectations for Q2. Frank will then review the details of our Q1 results and provide some additional color about our outlook. Q1 was our third consecutive quarter of stability with the quarter and individual deals playing out largely as expected. We are not yet hearing that customers' budgets are increasing but the more predictable spending patterns are encouraging. Our team delivered another solid quarter with consistent performance across our geographic theaters. We had a strong performance from our service provider vertical, which correlates to unusually strong perpetual license software revenue in the quarter. This is likely less indicative of service provider trends overall and more of a reflection of F5's position in some key projects.\nWe delivered Q1 revenue above the high end of our guidance range. In addition, our continued operating discipline enabled us to deliver non-GAAP operating margins of 35.5%. This is up more than 900 basis points from the year ago period. As a result of these factors and a modest tax benefit, we also delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 39% with EPS of $3.43 per share, well above the high end of our guidance range. Our customers are still watching their budgets closely. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by several factors, including better predictability from customers, improving systems demand and the fact that some customers are making decisions that investments need to happen now. We are cautiously optimistic that these factors signal an easing of the extreme customer spending caution that characterized last year.\nAnd in fact, we are seeing stronger underlying demand. Because of the backlog headwind we faced in FY '24, despite improving demand signals, we expect our Q2 revenue will be down low single digits from Q2 of last year. Frank will discuss our outlook in greater detail in a few minutes. As little as 5 years ago, nearly every large enterprise organization expected that they would move their application environments from on-premises to the public cloud or SaaS. They also expected that doing so would dramatically simplify their operations and reduce costs. Instead today, customers are grappling with a more intricate and costly set of challenges than ever before. In our most recent State of Application Strategy research, 88% of our customers report they are currently operating applications across on-premises and cloud environments. The same research found that 38% of organizations are hosting their applications in 6 different types of environments.\nThe expanding number of applications across distributed environments demands specific expertise and tools for each environment, which adds cost and operational complexity. At the same time, this expanded landscape provides cybercriminals with more potential targets, amplifying security concerns. This complexity is further intensified by the rapid growth in the number of applications, a growth trajectory that is poised to accelerate significantly with the widespread adoption and proliferation of AI. We firmly believe that F5 is strategically positioned to support our customers as they navigate these escalating challenges across a rapidly evolving landscape. Our innovation and product portfolio evolution over the last several years has been aimed at addressing exactly these challenges.\nBefore I pass the call to Frank, I will speak to some customer highlights from the quarter. Our F5 BIG-IP family serves traditional applications, either on-premises, co-located or in cloud environments. BIG-IP's data plane performance, automation capabilities and seamless integration into public cloud environments continues to differentiate it from competitors. Our commitment to innovation and to providing customer flexibility through a range of consumption models also has enabled us to continue to gain share in the traditional ADC space. BIG-IP's capabilities drove a significant win in Q1 with a North American service provider. The customer is now deploying F5 cloud-native software at scale in its 5G architecture.\nOver the last 5 years, we have invested to modernize BIG-IP and to deliver industry-leading container-native functions to scale and secure 5G cloud infrastructures. These investments made this win possible. Modern F5 BIG-IP software is now powering the growth from this provider's consumer 5G handset demand and securing its overall fixed wireless access offerings, the fastest-growing 5G service in North America.\nTurning to F5 NGINX, which serves modern container-native and microservices-based applications and APIs. We continue to see large enterprises adopt NGINX for their cloud and Kubernetes-based applications. As those applications scale, we are seeing our NGINX opportunity scale as well. In addition, customers are also leveraging NGINX for app layer security for containers. In Q1, an APAC-based auto manufacturer selected NGINX Plus with App Protect to power and protect its next-generation connected car data and service offering. Beyond the standard car-related maintenance information, the customer is empowering a range of vehicle-related services from traffic management and statistics to fleet management and automated insurance claims. The customer envisions providing rich data-enabled services, including traffic data to government agencies for road maintenance and enabling automated insurance claim filing using telemetry and location data.\nThe customer selected NGINX for this ambitious project because of its unique ability to implement WAF for containers on AWS as well as its ability to support specific requirements that could not be met by native cloud services.\nF5 Distributed Cloud Services is a portfolio of SaaS and managed services which we have built from a combination of organic and inorganic efforts. The platform will have its second birthday shortly and continues to gain traction with customers as a result of its flexibility and strong capabilities. We are intercepting 2 exciting growth categories with Distributed Cloud, Webapp and API Protection, or WAAP, and the emerging opportunity in secure multi-cloud networking. In fact, we have seen explosive growth in the number of attacks blocked by Distributor Cloud's WAAP capabilities with a number of blocked attacks growing more than 100% in Q1 from Q4.\nIn one WAAP win from the quarter, a large U.S.-based financial institution selected F5 Distributed Cloud Services to solve its challenge of application security in hybrid cloud. The customer leveraged our flexible consumption program, adding API discovery and protection to manage the many fintech aggregator applications that access their financial data through APIs. F5 Distributed Cloud Services is also gaining traction in API security. In just the last 12 months, we have observed a substantial increase in the volume of API attacks. 95% of customers surveyed for our State of Application Strategy report say they have deployed an API gateway. This is a significant increase from 2019 when only 35% have deployed one. In fact, 92% of the total attacks mitigated by Distributed Cloud in Q1 were targeted towards APIs. That is up from 73% in Q4.\nAs an example of an API security win in Q1, following multiple service-impacting outages, a service provider in our APAC region selected Distributed Cloud to replace their prior API security vendor. Distributed Cloud's multi-cloud networking capabilities are making it possible for the customer to switch between public clouds when necessary while providing visibility and reporting via a single pane of glass. F5 Distributed Cloud Services is also gaining traction in secure multi-cloud networking use cases.\nIn another example from Q1, a global provider of traditional and digital learning resources deployed Distributed Cloud Services. The customer was looking for consistent application-level security, multi-cloud scalability and networking. Distributed Cloud enable them to simplify their infrastructure, strengthen the management of their multi-cloud architecture and improve application security. They also deployed multiple F5 customer edge software instances in their cloud infrastructure and in their on-premises data center, enabling them to meet an aggressive cloud migration schedule.\nI will spend just [ 2 minutes ] talking about the opportunity we see emerging with AI applications. AI will accelerate the growth in the number of applications and APIs. We are seeing the start of this already in the form of AI models and new AI-driven services becoming available from start-ups and established tech companies alike. We expect that as enterprises ramp adoption of AI over the next 1 to 2 years, that adoption will bring with it a flood of new enterprise applications that leverage those AI models and the APIs of the new AI-driven services.\nThese AI-powered applications differ from typical applications in several important ways: first, they are API-driven, both in terms of leveraging the APIs of third-party AI models and services and also in terms of exposing their own capabilities as APIs for downstream use. Thus, API security for these AI-powered apps is critical. Customers tell us that API security is the top security service in used or planned for use to protect the integrity of AI and machine learning models. Customers also tell us that AI is driving demand for a comprehensive API security solution, inclusive of DDoS protection, bot detection and data masking and leak protection.\nSecond, AI-powered applications tend to be comprised of many different components and data sources, which are distributed across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. F5 is an AI enabler. Effectively optimizing, managing and securing AI applications and the APIs that connect them demands a blend of specialized expertise and capabilities that align seamlessly with our solutions portfolio. We are the application and API expert with a deep understanding of the needs of demanding applications built over decades. This expertise and the capabilities of F5 Distributed Cloud Services is a powerful combination, particularly as customers begin to deploy real-life AI use cases.\nDuring Q1, we secured a win that highlights the synergies of our product families and showcases how F5 supports and enables AI-driven use cases. An EMEA-based service provider selected the combination of F5 Distributed Cloud Services and BIG-IP to secure and deliver a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service offering for their B2B customers. After comparing F5's capabilities to alternatives, the customer determined only F5 can meet the security and scalability requirements needed to deliver their offering in a cost-efficient way. These real-life use cases offer a view to how we are enabling customers to secure, deliver and optimize their applications and APIs and how we simplify the challenges of operating in a complex hybrid multi-cloud world. Now I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, François, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q1 results before I elaborate on our Q2 outlook. We delivered Q1 revenue of $693 million, reflecting sales that were down 1% year-over-year with a mix of 56% global services and 44% product revenue. Global services revenue of $387 million grew a strong 7% due to continued high maintenance renewals as well as the continued benefit from price increases we introduced in FY '22. Product revenue totaled $306 million, down 10% year-over-year. Systems revenue of $135 million declined 22% year-over-year, reflecting a lower level of backlog-related shipments than we had in the year ago period. Software revenue grew 2% over the year ago period to $170 million.\nAs François noted, Q1 was an unusually strong perpetual software license quarter with several service providers opting to leverage CapEx versus OpEx models. Our perpetual software revenue was $46 million in Q1, representing 19% growth year-over-year and 27% of Q1 software revenue. We believe providing consumption model flexibility to our customers is a strategic advantage over competitors who restrict customer choice. The result can be quarters like this one, where we have unusual growth in perpetual software revenue. We do not believe that Q1 software revenue mix is indicative of changing customer preferences. Rather, it is a function of preferences of specific customers in the quarter.\nOur subscription-based revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $125 million, representing 73% of Q1's total software revenue. New subscriptions and renewals both performed to plan in the quarter. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 73% of Q1's revenue, up from 68% a year ago. This is down slightly from recent levels as a result of the perpetual license revenue contribution in the quarter. Recurring revenue includes subscription-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue.\nOn a regional basis, revenue from Americas was down 6% year-over-year, representing 54% of total revenue. EMEA grew 5%, representing 28% of revenue, and APAC grew 8%, representing 18% of revenue. Looking at our major verticals. During Q1, enterprise represented 64% of product bookings, service providers represented 17%, and government customers represented 19%, including 4% from U.S. federal. Our Q1 operating results were strong, reflecting our continued operating discipline. GAAP gross margin was 80.3%, non-GAAP gross margin was 83.1%, an improvement of 264 basis points from Q1 of FY '23. GAAP operating expenses were $392 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $330 million.\nOur GAAP operating margin was 23.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%, an improvement of more than 900 basis points from Q1 of FY '23. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.9%. This is below our initial expectations for the year as a result of IRS guidance issued during the quarter relating to foreign tax credits. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $138 million or $2.32 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $205 million or $3.43 per share, well above the top end of our guidance range. This is a result of the revenue beat, continued operating discipline with $0.09 as a result of the Q1 tax benefit.\nI will now turn to cash flow and the balance sheet, which also remain very strong. We generated $165 million in cash flow from operations in Q1. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million. DSO for the quarter was 67 days due to the back-end linearity of invoicing in the quarter. Cash and investments totaled approximately $832 million at quarter end. Deferred revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $1.83 billion. Our share repurchases reflect our ongoing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased $150 million worth of F5 shares in Q1 at an average price of $163 per share. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,440 employees.\nFrançois outlined our Q2 outlook at the start of the call. I'll recap it with some additional color. We expect Q2 revenue in the range of $675 million to $695 million. We expect gross margins in the range of 82% to 83%. We estimate Q2 operating expenses of $347 million to $359 million. This is a step-up from Q1, reflecting our seasonal sequential uptick related to the reset and payroll taxes. This year, it also reflects marketing expenses related to our global AppWorld customer events, which will take place in Q2 in San Jose and in other locations across the globe. We are targeting Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.79 to $2.91 per share. We expect Q2 share-based compensation expense of approximately $56 million to $58 million. At this point in the fiscal year, we are not revising our revenue or operating margin targets for FY '24.\nWe continue to expect to achieve our FY '24 operating margin target range of 33% to 34%, which accounts for the normal seasonal step-up in operating expenses from Q1 to Q2. We now expect our FY '24 tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 22%, down slightly from our prior range of 21% to 23%. Given the new outlook in our annual tax rate, we now expect FY '24 non-GAAP EPS will grow between 6% to 8%. This is up from the 5% to 7% range we provided last quarter. I will now turn the call back over to François. François?\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Frank. In conclusion, I will reiterate that F5 is the only company capable of securing, delivering and optimizing any application, any API regardless of its location, be it in the data center, any one of the public clouds, as SaaS, or at the network edge. Amidst a complex web of environments and solutions, F5 empowers customers to establish and maintain a consistent security posture across all of their applications, enhancing security, streamlining operations and reducing costs. Moreover, we are unifying our solutions to provide customers with unprecedented levels of visibility, manageability and automation.\nBefore we go to questions, I will elaborate on the strategy and product session we are hosting next Thursday. We are going to use this event to discuss the hybrid multi-cloud challenges faced by large organizations worldwide including the implications of AI on applications, APIs and security. We also will provide an overview of our product families, the market opportunities we see for them and how our portfolio transformation benefits our customers and differentiates F5. We look forward to seeing several of you live in San Jose and more of you virtually. Operator, please open the call to questions."

With that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In my remarks today, I will speak to our Q4 and FY '23 highlights as well as our expectations for FY '24. Frank will then review the details of our Q4 and FY '23 results and provide some additional color about our outlook. We delivered a solid Q4 in an environment that showed some additional signs of stabilization. We saw strength from our enterprise vertical, including technology and financial services customers, offset by softness from service providers.\nThe result was Q4 revenue near the high end of our guidance range. Our continued operating discipline helped us deliver earnings per share well above the high end of our range. Our global services team delivered robust 9% revenue growth driven by strong maintenance renewals and reflecting the benefit of price increases announced last year. In addition, software revenue grew 11%, aided by 27% growth in subscription software.\nSoftware revenue from renewals, which have performed well all year, picked up in Q4 over Q3. And while new subscriptions remained down year-over-year, we saw some improvement compared to the first half. Strength in global services and software offset a systems decline of 25%, which reflects a lower level of backlog-related shipments than we had for the first 3 quarters of the year. Stepping back and looking at fiscal year 2023, we adjusted to the environmental challenges we faced, resolving supply chain pressures and largely returning to normalized delivery times.\nWe took decisive actions to adjust our operating model to the realities of the demand environment, driving meaningful improvements to our operating margins and delivering 15% EPS growth. We also returned 58% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases. Highlights from FY '23 include: first, subscription renewals performed largely to plan for the year. In today's tough IT spend environment, this is a strong signal that customers are getting the value and return they expect from our software solutions.\nSecond, distributed cloud services, SaaS offerings are gaining traction with both new and existing customers. In fact, 29% of distributed cloud SaaS customers are new to F5. In total, we now have more than 500 customers for our SaaS services on distributed cloud, an increase of more than 200% since Q4 of last year. Third, we are having very good success displacing a traditional ADC competitor in both software and hardware form factors. And finally, we delivered meaningful operating improvements, driving our non-GAAP operating margin up 130 basis points from FY '22.\nAs we look ahead, we enter FY '24 in an environment that seems to be stabilizing. In fact, from a demand perspective, we saw encouraging early signs with enterprise customers in Q4, though it is too soon to say if what we are seeing is a durable trend. As we contemplate our outlook for FY '24, we consider a number of factors. At the macro level, we expect continued application and API growth fueled by automation efforts and new use cases, including generative AI. We also expect customer spending caution persist into FY '24, but is stable. And finally, we believe the tension between application and API growth and customers' ability to sweat assets will reach a tipping point, causing them to reinvest in their application infrastructure likely beginning sometime in FY '24.\nAt the F5 level, we also consider, first, we have an approximately $180 million revenue headwind from FY '23's backlog fulfillment, primarily in systems. Second, we expect flat to modest total software revenue growth in FY '24 as a result of a number of dynamics, including continued subscription renewal strength and steady distributed cloud SaaS revenue growth. These positive trends will be offset by a series of transitions we are executing in our SaaS and managed services offerings.\nAnd third, we expect our global services revenue will return to low single-digit growth as we lap price increases. As a result of these factors, we expect our FY '24 revenue will be flat to down low single digits from FY '23, inclusive of the 6% headwind related to FY '23 backlog shipments. We also expect to return to mid-single-digit revenue growth in FY '25.\nWhether we achieve the low or high end of our revenue range, we are committed to driving continued strong profitability, and we will continue to manage our operating model with discipline. We expect to deliver FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin in a range of 33% to 34%. We are also targeting FY '24 non-GAAP EPS growth of 5% to 7% reflecting growth of at least 10% on a tax-neutral basis compared to FY '23. Our growth opportunity is fundamentally linked to the continued growth of applications and APIs and the need to secure, deliver and optimize those apps and APIs. F5 is the only company that can deliver, secure and optimize any app and API anywhere. Our security and delivery solutions offer a custom fit for each app and API. Modern apps and APIs require different solutions than legacy apps. We have the right solutions for both. In addition to delivering the right tools for the right app or API, our combination of deployable software and hardware and SaaS and managed service offerings means we are the only vendor that can serve every app and API across all environments, in a data center, public cloud and at the edge.\nWe are the only company who can do this today. And going forward, further integration and convergence of our solutions will make it much easier for our customers to secure and deliver their apps across all infrastructure environments. The power of our converged portfolio is resonating with customers who are able to deploy the solutions they need today with the knowledge that F5 will be with them on every step of their multi-cloud journey.\nBefore I pass the call to Frank, I will speak to some customer highlights from each of our product families. Our F5 BIG-IP family serves traditional applications either on-premises, co-located or in cloud environments. BIG-IP's data plane performance, automation capabilities and seamless integration into public cloud environments continues to differentiate the platform, and we continue to win against competitors. From a hardware perspective, the value proposition with our next-generation platforms is resonating with customers with our rSeries and VELOS platforms, representing more than 80% of Q4 systems bookings.\nIn 1 example of a 5 BIG-IP win from Q4, we displaced a competitor at a North American health care customer. The opportunity arose as a result of the incumbent providers inability to handle a mission-critical upgrade to the customer's physician portal. The customer selected F5 BIG-IP based on its advanced application delivery capabilities, secure access management, our partnership with their health care records platform and confidence in our road map. In addition to providing the mission-critical functionality the customer needed urgently, we replaced all of the competitors use cases with the customer, simplifying their application environment and future-proofing their data centers.\nF5 NGINX delivered a very strong Q4. NGINX serves modern container native and microservices-based applications and APIs. We continue to see large enterprises adopt NGINX for their cloud and Kubernetes workloads. And as those applications scale, we are seeing our NGINX opportunity scale as well. In addition, customers are also leveraging NGINX for app layer security for containers. As an example, in Q4, when the e-commerce division of a global technology customer needed to comply with new data security standards, they selected NGINX app protect to implement app layer security to the containers processing consumers' credit card data.\nWe have invested both organically and inorganically to build our F5 distributed cloud services, a portfolio of SaaS and managed services. Apart from the offering transitions I mentioned, we are really excited about the future for distributed cloud. We are intercepting 2 exciting emerging growth categories, web app and API protection or WAP and secure multi-cloud networking or secure MCN that will drive future growth for distributed cloud services.\nIn 1 WAP win for the quarter, we are helping an EMEA-based banking customer evolve from its traditional WAF security posture to a more comprehensive WAP solution that encompasses web application firewall as well as API protection, bot defense and Layer 7 DDoS protection. This customer approached us when they came under attack by a malicious foreign actor that their existing WAF could not handle. Against multiple competitors, we successfully demonstrated the superiority of our WAP offering, including our ability to protect major payment companies APIs. Early traction for our secure multi-cloud networking offerings includes a Q4 win with a large retailer in Latin America that also offers a range of financial services to its customers.\nAs part of its digital transformation efforts, the customer needed a solution to enable them to grow and manage their expanding body of cloud-native applications. They also plan to migrate their large, existing footprint of virtual machines and on-premises appliances to the cloud. After a thorough proof of concept, the customer selected our secure multi-cloud networking solution because of our ability to use the customer edge to make the move 100% transparent to both internal users and consumers.\nWe are also seeing cross-portfolio traction with customers who are operating in hybrid environments, choosing to deploy F5 across multiple form factors. In a win that highlights the synergies of our product families, during Q4, we secured a win with an APAC-based financial services provider. The customer launched a multifaceted modernization project designed to add and consolidate applications and enable scalability to handle exponential traffic growth. They also needed help stopping a barrage of constant automated attacks.\nIn a competitive bid, our combination of BIG-IP and F5 distributed cloud bot Defense won out. The combination enables the customer to manage unpredictable traffic growth, customize services for each application and enhance their security posture with our ML-based AI engine. These real life use cases offer a view to how we are enabling customers to secure, deliver, optimize and manage their applications and APIs and how we simplify the challenges of operating in a complex hybrid multi-cloud world.\nNow I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q4 and FY '23 results before I elaborate on the outlook Francois shared. We delivered Q4 revenue of $707 million, reflecting 1% growth year-over-year with a mix of 54% global services and 46% product revenue. Global Services revenue of $382 million grew a strong 9% due to continued high maintenance renewals as well as the price increases we introduced last year. Product revenue totaled $325 million, down 7% year-on-year. .\nSystems revenue of $134 million declined 25% year-over-year, reflecting a lower level of backlog-related shipments than we had in prior quarters and demand that showed some signs of stabilization albeit at lower levels than we have seen historically. In contrast, software revenue grew 11% over the year ago period to a new high of $191 million. Subscription-based revenue grew 27% year-over-year to $166 million, another record high, representing 87% of Q4's total software revenue. Perpetual software license sales of $25 million represented 13% of Q4 software revenue.\nRevenue from recurring sources contributed 76% of Q4's revenue, another all-time high. Recurring revenue includes subscription-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue. On a regional basis, revenue from Americas was down 6% year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA grew 16%, representing 26% of revenue, and APAC grew 4%, representing 17% of revenue. Looking at our major verticals. During Q4, enterprise customers represented 72% of product bookings.\nService providers represented 9% and government customers represented 19%, including 7% from U.S. Federal. Our Q4 operating results were strong, reflecting operating discipline and a full quarter benefit from the cost reductions announced in April. GAAP gross margin was 80.1%, non-GAAP gross margin was 82.7%, an improvement of 125 basis points from Q4 of FY '22.\nGAAP operating expenses were $394 million, non=GAAP operating expenses were $345 million. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses as a percent of revenue was below 49%, resuming pre-2019 acquisition levels. Our GAAP operating margin was 24.3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.9%, representing an improvement of more than 600 basis points from Q4 of FY '22.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14% below our initial expectations for the year as a result of IRS guidance issued during the quarter relating to foreign tax credits. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $152 million or $2.55 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $209 million or $3.50 per share well above the top end of our guidance range of $3.15 to $3.27 per share. This reflects the combined impact of our gross margin improvements and operating expense discipline as well as the Q4 tax benefit. I will now turn to cash flow and the balance sheet, which also remained very strong.\nWe generated $190 million in cash flow from operations in Q4, driven by our improved profitability. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $15 million. DSO for the quarter was 58 days. Cash and investments totaled approximately $808 million at quarter end. Deferred revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1.78 billion. We repurchased $60 million worth of shares in Q4. For the year, we used 58% of our approximately $600 million of free cash flow for share repurchases. I note that in each of the past 3 years, we have met or exceeded our share repurchase commitments.\nFinally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,500 employees. I will now recap our FY '23 results. For the year, revenue grew 4% to $2.8 billion. Global Services revenue grew 7% to $1.5 billion, representing 53% of total revenue for the year. Product revenue grew 1% to $1.3 billion, representing 47% of total revenue. For the second year in a row, software represented roughly 50% of product revenue. Software revenue was flat compared to last year at $664 million. This was down from our initial expectation of 15% to 20% growth as a result of customers delaying large transformational projects.\nAs Francois noted, software renewals performed largely as planned. We delivered $671 million in systems revenue during the year, representing 3% growth. I would now like to provide some additional information regarding software revenue. We've said we intended to provide additional software revenue details as the SaaS business scaled. As we said last October, we had several SaaS and managed service transitions planned. We started these transitions in FY '23, and they will continue through FY '24 and FY '25, leading to some short-term revenue variability that is not necessarily indicative of potential future performance.\nWe believe that providing visibility to our SaaS and managed service revenue and to the transitions that are underway provides greater clarity on both our FY '24 revenue expectations and our expectation of returning to mid-single-digit revenue growth in FY '25. Today, I will speak to 3 components of our FY '23 software revenue. The first, term subscriptions; the second, SaaS and managed services; and the third, perpetual licenses. We intend to continue to report the SaaS and managed service portion of our revenue on an annual basis going forward.\nIn FY '23, revenue from term-based subscriptions comprised of BIG-IP and NGINX subscriptions contributed $353 million to software revenue, up 9% year-over-year. Under ASC 606, sales of term-based subscriptions are recognized largely upfront as software revenue. The remainder is deferred and recognized as service revenue over the term of the subscription.\nThe majority of our term-based subscriptions are contracted for 3 years. Term subscriptions include both new renewal and true forward or expansion revenue for both annual and multiyear subscriptions of deployable software. New revenue includes new customers as well as new use cases or offerings sold to existing customers. In FY '23, renewal and true Forward or expansion revenue experienced healthy year-over-year growth, offsetting the weakness in new term subscription software projects. Renewals performing largely to plan and FY '23 is encouraging for several reasons.\nFirst, given the current levels of customer spending scrutiny, strong renewals are a signal that customers are getting the value they demand. Second, our renewals motion is still relatively new and it's great to see confirmation that it is working as intended. The second component of our software revenue, SaaS and managed services contributed $203 million in revenue in FY '23, up 2% year-over-year.\nSaaS and managed service is comprised of our F5 distributed cloud SaaS offerings. Revenue from managed services, including our legacy F5 Silverline offering and our anti-bot and anti-fraud offerings as well as revenue from legacy SaaS offerings. SaaS and managed service sales are recognized ratably as product revenue over the term of the subscription.\nAt the end of FY '23, our SaaS and managed services ARR was $198 million, down approximately 2% year-over-year. There were 4 primary contributors to this performance. First, we are seeing solid early momentum from our F5 distributed cloud service SaaS offerings. Second, in FY '23, our most advanced anti-bot and anti-fraud managed service solutions underperformed relative to our plan as a result of customer spending caution and budget scrutiny.\nThird, in FY '23, we began migrating customers from our legacy Silverline managed service offerings to our F5 distributed cloud SaaS offering. And fourth, we began executing the planned retirement of legacy SaaS offerings from companies we acquired. Both the Silverline customer migrations and the retirement of legacy SaaS offerings resulted in planned revenue churn. The third component of our software revenue is perpetual licenses, which contributed $108 million in software revenue, down year-over-year after unusually strong FY '22.\nIn FY '23, 71% of our revenue was recurring, up from 69% in FY '22. Several years ago, we began breaking out our security-related revenue annually. This year, our total security revenue, which includes stand-alone security, attached security and security related to maintenance revenue was approximately $1.1 billion or 40% of total revenue. Our stand-alone security product revenue grew 5% to approximately $475 million. We are seeing good traction with the lower-end anti-bot offering delivered through distributed cloud services as well as from security on NGINX.\nOur FY '23 security revenue growth was affected by customer spending caution, including stall transformational projects and the underperformance of advanced anti-bot, anti-fraud solutions, as I mentioned previously. During the year, we overcame supply chain challenges and successfully returned our lead times to normal levels. As a result, our FY '23 product backlog returned to pre supply chain challenge levels and we closed the year with approximately $53 million in product backlog. I will now turn to our FY '23 operating performance. GAAP gross margin in FY '23 was 78.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 81.5%, down 110 basis points from FY '22 as a result of higher supply chain costs in FY '23. Our GAAP operating margin for FY '23 was 16.8%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.2%, up 130 basis points from FY '22 as a result of our previously announced cost reductions.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 18.7%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 18.3%. Our FY '23 annual tax rate was lower than expected primarily due to IRS guidance issued during the fourth quarter related to foreign tax credits. GAAP Net income for FY '23 was $395 million or $6.55 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $705 million or $11.70 per share representing growth of 14.8% over FY '22. Francois outlined our annual and longer-term outlook at the start of the call. I will recap it with some additional color. I will also provide our outlook for Q1.\nWith the exception of revenue, my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. In our FY '24 outlook, we've made the following assumptions. We expect customer spending caution will continue into FY '24, but we also expect customers will begin to reinvest at some point in the year. We expect our Global Services revenue will return to low single-digit growth as we lap price increases. We have approximately $180 million revenue headwind in systems from FY '23's backlog fulfillment. We expect to continue to take share in the traditional ADC space with BIG-IP in both hardware and software form factors.\nWithin our software revenue, we expect continued strength from our term subscription renewals and continued growth from our F5 Distributed Cloud SaaS offerings. As I discussed previously, we will have some planned revenue churn as we work through the SaaS and managed service transitions I discussed. We expect these transitions will be largely complete in FY '25. In FY '23, any ARR associated with the transitions is approximately $65 million, a little more than half of which is associated with the offerings we intend to transition on to distributed cloud over the next 2 years.\nThe net of these assumptions combined with the current demand levels leads us to expect FY '24 revenue in the range of flat to down low single digits from FY '23. Excluding the $180 million or 6% headwind from our FY '23 backlog reduction, our guidance range would reflect low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in FY '24. Whether we achieve the bottom or top end of this range largely depends on when customers resume more normal levels of spending. We expect some continued quarter-to-quarter variability as a result of upfront revenue recognition related to our term subscription offerings.\nRegardless of our revenue performance, we remain committed to driving strong profitability. From an operating perspective, we expect gross margin will improve in fiscal year '24 to the range of 82% to 83%. This is primarily the result of supply chain-related cost pressures working their way out of our model. We expect our continued operating expense discipline will result in FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 33% to 34% for the year.\nOn a percent of revenue basis, this would put our operating expenses roughly in line with 2018 levels at roughly 49% of revenue. We expect our FY '24 effective tax rate will be 21% to 23%. In FY '24, we expect to deliver 5% to 7% non-GAAP earnings growth, which translates to at least 10% year-over-year growth on a tax-neutral basis. Finally, we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow for share repurchases consistent with the approach we have discussed previously.\nAs of the end of FY '23, we had $922 million remaining on our previously announced authorized share repurchase program. We also want to take the opportunity to speak to our expectations beyond FY '24 as we believe it will help signal how we intend to run the business longer term. As Francois noted, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth in FY '25. We expect to drive additional gross margin improvements and to deliver gross margins between 83% and 84%.\nWe expect to grow our operating expenses slower than revenue, resulting in an operating margin of at least 35%. We will continue to prioritize profitability, adjusting our operating model if needed, to enable us to deliver at least 10% compounded annual non-GAAP EPS growth. Finally, we intend to continue to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow towards share repurchases. I'll conclude with our expectations for Q1 of FY '24. We expect Q1 revenue in the range of $675 million to $695 million. We expect gross margins in the range of 82% to 83%. We estimate Q1 operating expenses of $332 million to $344 million. We are targeting Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.97 to $3.09 per share. We expect Q1 share-based compensation expense of approximately $58 million to $60 million. I will now turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Frank. Before we open the call to questions, I want to address our view on F5's AI opportunity. At the highest level, we believe customers' use of AI will accelerate the growth of applications and APIs and the corresponding need to deploy manage and secure them, which is what we do best.\nWe also believe AI inference, the process of using a trained model to make predictions on never seen before data will become increasingly distributed. Organizations will need to support it anywhere from data centers to manufacturing floors to public clouds. We believe every application and API will soon require inference just as they require security and traffic management. With our rich history of delivering innovative ML-based security solutions, including bot defense, protection against denial of service attacks and anti-fraud and our role in the flow of application traffic, we are uniquely positioned to secure AI workloads wherever they reside and to empower our customers to run AI wherever they need it.\nIn conclusion, we are leveraging our incumbency and our position in the flow of 40% of the world's Internet traffic to deliver hybrid multi-cloud solutions that dramatically simplify application and API deployment security and management for our customers. We are also significantly reducing our customers' total cost of ownership. We are uniting and automating all of our customers' apps and APIs across their data centers, cloud and edge environment. We are encouraged both by the early signs of stability we saw in the second half of '23 and with the resonance, our converging portfolio is having with customers. We have an installed base of 20,000 customers, all of whom have an acute and significant multi-cloud challenge.\nOther than F5, there is no one company that can address this challenge. With F5 distributed cloud services, we have created a platform to drive SaaS growth in the future. In closing, I will reiterate the 3 pillars of our long-term operating model, which will enable us to drive double-digit earnings on a compound annual growth rate. Number one, delivering sustained mid-single-digit revenue growth supported by our differentiated positioning in attractive end markets, along with our durable high-margin global services business.\nNumber two, driving non-GAAP operating margin expansion, which we will achieve through gross margin improvement and operating discipline; and number three, returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases using at least 50% of our annual free cash flow.\nOperator, please open the call to questions."

Other members of the F5 executive team are also on hand to answer questions during the Q&A session.\nA copy of today's press release is available on our website at f5.com, where an archived version of today's audio will be available through October 24, 2023. The slide deck accompanying today's discussion is viewable on the webcast and will be posted to our IR site at the conclusion of our call.

We have summarized factors that may affect our results in the press release announcing our financial results and in detail in our SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will reference non-GAAP metrics during today's discussion. Please see our full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in today's press release and in the appendix of our earnings slide deck. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. In my remarks today, I will speak to the quarter's results and the current customer spending environment and will then highlight some notable customer wins from the quarter, including some emerging areas where we are seeing good early traction.\nOverall, customer caution persists with customers continuing to sweat assets amidst tight budgets and lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. Despite the tough environment, our team is executing well, and we delivered third quarter revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range with earnings per share well above the high end of our range.\nFrom a demand perspective, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization. Q3 demand played out slightly above our beginning-of-quarter forecast, which was up from Q1 and Q2 this year, though still off from FY '22 levels. Our global services team delivered strong 8% growth driven by a continuation of customer trends from the first half of the year, including strong maintenance renewals and price realization.\nWith customers sweating existing assets, we also continue to see higher maintenance attach rates on older deployments. Our product revenue grew 1% with systems revenue growing 5% and software revenue declining 3% year-over-year. While systems revenue is benefiting from supply chain normalization and our efforts to substantially work down backlog, systems demand remains constrained.\nIn contrast, we are seeing some positive signs in software demand. Total software revenue was down 3% year-over-year against a strong Q3 2022 compare. However, total software grew 32% sequentially. And within software, our subscription software revenue grew 4% year-over-year to a record high $152 million. This reflects strong growth in our software renewals and interim expansions or true-forwards as well as some stabilization in new term subscriptions from the first half.\nMoving from revenue to our operating results. We are also demonstrating operating discipline and driving operating leverage. Our Q3 non-GAAP gross margins of 82.5% improved more than 200 basis points from Q2. This was slightly ahead of our guidance and reflects the combination of expected supply chain easing and price realization as well as some of the ancillary supply chain costs like broker and expedite fees finally working their way out of our inventory as planned.\nIn addition, our Q3 non-GAAP operating margins of 33.2% improved 600 basis points from Q2 and more than 400 basis points from Q3 FY '22. As a result of these improvements as well as some tax favorability, we significantly overachieved our non-GAAP EPS expectations in the quarter and now expect to deliver double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for FY 2023. We believe our growth opportunity is fundamentally linked to the continued growth of applications and APIs and the need to secure, deliver and optimize those apps and APIs.\nAs part of our efforts to capture that growth, we continue to drive innovation, advances and integration across our product families, including F5 BIG-IP, F5 NGINX and F5 Distributed Cloud Services. I will call out some customer highlights from each product family from the quarter.\nOur BIG-IP family, which serves traditional applications, either on-premises, colocated or in cloud environments, continues to take share from competitors who have failed to invest in innovation. From a hardware perspective, the value proposition with our next-generation platforms is resonating with customers with our rSeries and Velos platforms representing more than 70% of Q3 systems bookings.\nOn the software side, BIG-IP's data plane performance, automation capabilities and lower total cost of ownership continues to differentiate our offering and drove multiple wins in the quarter, including wins at a major American airline, a multinational automobile manufacturer, and a major U.K. retail and commercial bank.\nWe also saw strong demand for F5 NGINX in the quarter. NGINX serves modern, container-native and microservices-based applications and APIs. We continue to see large enterprises adopt NGINX for their cloud and Kubernetes workloads. We have repeatedly demonstrated that when applications are built with NGINX from the ground up and those apps grow, we grow with them. We saw this in several NGINX growth opportunities in the quarter, including a multimillion-dollar term-based subscription renewal that grew by an extraordinary 10x from initial inception.\nThe customer, which provides a large collaboration platform, is streamlining deployments in both public and private clouds using F5 NGINX as their single platform for load balancing, caching and telemetry.\nOver the last several years, we have invested both organically and inorganically to build a portfolio of SaaS and managed services called F5 Distributed Cloud Services. Since launching Distributed Cloud in February of '22, we have been expanding our offerings and building momentum for multiple security use cases.\nA good example of this is a win with a global financial services industry application provider that wanted to standardize its Web Application Firewall in API protection, or WAF, policies and deployments in APAC and EMEA to reduce time to delivery. Their existing disjoint action security and complex policy tuning was a challenge as was managing apps and APIs across distributed environments with a small team.\nToday, F5 Distributed Cloud Services is protecting their apps and APIs with WAP and multi-cloud networking, reducing their time to delivery from months to minutes. It is early days still, but we also are seeing encouraging signs that our Distributed Cloud Services are intercepting the market specifically in 2 emerging categories: API security and multi-cloud networking.\nOn API security, with the growth of modern applications using containers and composed of distributed microservices, the number of ADI endpoints is exploding. CISOs tell us they struggle to know how many APIs they have, where they all are, who is connecting to them and to what extent they are secured. Doing so requires robust API discovery and protection capabilities like those we offer in our distributed cloud API security service.\nWhen a North American service provider experienced a serious cybersecurity incident, which caused them to lose their entire virtualization infrastructure at multiple data centers, they turn to us for urgent help. F5 Distributed Cloud Services' superior features, functionality and value, beat a competitive offering, and we worked with the customer to emergency onboard the platform, including advanced WAP, bot defense and API security. Once deployed, the customer immediately started migrating sites, restoring their services.\nWe are also seeing strong early traction in our distributed cloud, multi-cloud networking offerings launched just this past March. 85% of respondents cited in our 2023 State of Application Strategy report said they already are managing multi-cloud environments. Securely connecting applications between on-premises, multi-cloud and edge environments at scale is a tough task for any organization.\nOur secure multi-cloud networking solutions changed the game. Our ability to package networking, security and distribution of applications and APIs is unique. Until now, customers have been forced to manage and secure these layers in isolation, often leading to operational complexity, network latency and weak security.\nOur multi-cloud networking solutions reduce operational complexity for our customers and make it possible for them to securely connect distributed networks and applications across public clouds, on-premises data centers and edge locations.\nCustomers are beginning to understand the power of our secure multi-cloud networks' ability to provide end-to-end visibility, control and security across all of their applications. This empowers them to move workloads to the cloud, between clouds and even to the edge while maintaining end-to-end visibility and consistent security policy.\nF5 Distributed Cloud uniquely unifies the visibility, control and security for every application and API so that applications can be delivered without constraints and with the security today's threat environment demands. Early traction for our secure multi-cloud networking offerings includes a win with one of the world's largest independent providers of insurance claims management systems.\nF5's multi-cloud networking now enables their global SaaS offerings. The customer first deployed our Distributed Cloud WAP in February of 2022 to protect a business-critical public cloud workload. In early '23, the customer was abruptly asked to leave a data center, forcing them to lift and shift workloads to the public cloud in just 2 weeks. They used F5 Distributed Cloud for this emergency lift and shift. In fact, the project went so smoothly that they opted to expedite moving their global data centers to public clouds.\nNow the customer has standardized on F5 Distributed Cloud for their secure multi-cloud networking needs, spanning across multiple clouds and protecting external and internal applications and APIs.\nThese are just some of the customer challenges we helped tackle in Q3. While we are not in a position to predict with precision when customer spending patterns will return to more normal levels, F5 is well placed to benefit when they do. We are encouraged both by the early signs of stability in Q3 and with the resonance our application and API-focused approach is having with customers.\nWe are making it possible for our customers to secure, deliver and optimize their applications and APIs with a consistent approach no matter what environment they are deployed in: data center, colocated, private cloud or public cloud. And this is a critical capability and differentiator in today's hybrid multi-cloud network world.\nNow I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q3 results before I discuss our fourth quarter outlook. We delivered Q3 revenue of $703 million, reflecting 4% growth year-over-year. Our revenue remained roughly split between global services and product with global services representing 53% of total revenue. Global services revenue of $374 million grew a strong 8% due to continued high maintenance renewals as well as the impacts of the price increases introduced last year.\nProduct revenue totaled $328 million, representing growth of 1% year-over-year. Systems revenue of $155 million grew 5% year-over-year. Software revenue totaled $174 million, down 3% from a tough compare in the year ago period. Our software revenue is comprised of both subscriptions and perpetual license sales.\nSubscription-based revenue hit a new high in Q3 in both dollars and as a percentage of software revenue. Our subscription revenue totaled $152 million or 87% of Q3's total software revenue and as Francois mentioned, grew 4% year-over-year.\nPerpetual license sales of $22 million represented 13% of Q3 software revenue. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 75% of Q3's revenue, which is a new all-time high as a result of the strong subscription contribution. Recurring revenue includes subscription-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue.\nOn a regional basis, revenue from Americas grew 3% year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA grew 16%, representing 26% of revenue, and APAC declined 6%, representing 18% of revenue.\nLooking at our major verticals. During Q3, enterprise customers represented 66% of product bookings. Service providers represented 13%, and government customers represented 21%, including 8% from U.S. Federal. Our Q3 operating results were strong, reflecting our previously announced cost reductions and overall operating discipline.\nGAAP gross margin was 79.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 82.5%, an improvement of more than 200 basis points sequentially. GAAP operating expenses were $457 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $346 million, slightly lower than our guided range and reflecting a partial quarter benefit from the cost reductions we announced in April.\nOur GAAP operating margin was 14.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.2%, representing a sequential improvement of more than 600 basis points. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.1%. This is below our target range for the year, largely driven by a nonrecurring benefit associated with the filing of our annual federal income tax return during the quarter.\nOur GAAP net income for the quarter was $89 million or $1.48 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was very strong at $194 million or $3.21 per share, well above the top end of our guided range of $2.78 to $2.90 per share. This reflects the combined impact of our gross margin improvements and operating expense discipline as well as a Q3 tax benefit.\nI will now turn to cash flow and the balance sheet, which also remains very strong. We generated $165 million in cash flow from operations in Q3 driven by our improved profitability and strong cash collections. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $15 million. DSO for the quarter was 56 days, down from 62 in Q2 and closer to our historic range as a result of earlier invoicing related to improved shipping linearity as our supply chain continued to stabilize.\nCash and investments totaled approximately $696 million at quarter end. Deferred revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $1.79 billion driven by the high service maintenance attach rates we've seen throughout the year and continued growth in subscription as a percent of our software mix. As we committed to on our last call, we repurchased $250 million worth of shares in Q3. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,500 employees, which reflects the head count reductions we announced in April.\nI will now share our outlook for Q4. We expect Q4 revenue in the range of $690 million to $710 million with gross margins of approximately 83%. Unless otherwise stated, my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics.\nWith the full quarter benefit from the cost reductions announced in April, we estimate Q4 operating expenses of $338 million to $350 million. Incorporating our year-to-date results, we have now narrowed our estimates for our FY '23 effective tax rate to approximately 20% for the year. As a result, we are targeting Q4 non-GAAP earnings in the range of $3.15 to $3.27 per share.\nWe expect Q4 share-based compensation expense of approximately $55 million to $57 million. Year-to-date, we have used 68% of our free cash flow towards repurchases. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and continue to expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow towards share repurchases.\nI will now turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Frank. Customers made F5 the standard for securing, delivering and optimizing traditional applications. Now with compelling and differentiated solutions for modern applications and APIs as well as those mission-critical traditional apps, we are being architected into new areas and use cases across our portfolio.\nOur holistic application and API-focused approach enables newfound consistency across environments and across hardware, software, and SaaS deployment models, which reduces risk, lowers operating costs and delivers better digital experiences.\nIn closing, I ask that you take away 3 things from this call. Number one, we are seeing some early and encouraging signs of demand stabilizing. Number two, we are seeing demonstrable proof points that the differentiated solutions portfolio we are creating through a combination of organic and inorganic innovation and technology integration is well aligned with how application architectures are evolving. And number three, we are delivering on the operating discipline we committed to and expect to produce additional leverage in FY 2024.\nOperator, please open the call to questions."

Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call. With that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our team delivered second quarter revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range and earnings per share above the high end of our range. These results come despite persistent macro uncertainty, which has led to broader and more severe customer budget scrutiny, impacting both our software and hardware demand. We have strong conviction that customers' constrained spending is a temporary headwind and that we are well positioned as a trusted and innovative partner for customers as they look to secure, scale, modernize and simplify their hybrid and multi-cloud application environments.\nIn my remarks today, I will speak to the quarter's results, the near-term spending dynamics we are seeing and why we remain confident in our positioning and growth opportunities longer term. First, on our Q2 performance. We delivered 11% revenue growth in Q2 as a result of stronger-than-expected system shipments and strong maintenance renewals. Our systems revenue grew 43%.\nAs positive as this is for the quarter, it is more a reflection of our team completing comprehensive board redesign efforts ahead of plan than it is a demand marker. You will recall that last year, rather than just wait for supply chain to improve, we initiated multiple board redesigns with a goal of designing out the hardest-to-get components and opening up new supply. The successful completion of this work is making it possible for us to fulfill waiting customer orders sooner than we anticipated. And as expected, we have seen no order cancellations in the process.\nOur Global Services revenue grew 8%, driven by continued strong renewal rates, which improved across nearly all cohorts. Wrapping up our Q2 results, we also delivered OpEx within guidance and non-GAAP EPS of $2.53 per share, above the top end of our guidance range. So the quarter's results were strong, but they obscure underlying customer spending patterns. Since our December quarter, we have seen customers scrutinizing budgets and deferring spend for anything except the most urgent projects.\nThese dynamics were even more pronounced in Q2 when we saw previously approved projects going through multiple additional levels of approvals. In some cases, approvals are reaching the C-suite or Board level only to be delayed or downsized. The impact of this extreme spending caution is most evident in our Q2 software revenue, which declined 13% year-over-year. This was well below our expectations for the year and our long-term growth expectations. We believe there are several reasons why we are seeing this kind of impact in our software revenue. These include the relative size of the software projects we tend to be involved in and the percentage of our software revenue derived from term subscriptions.\nFirst, the majority of our software growth to date has come from transformational type projects of size, often 6- or 7-figure deals. We are seeing larger projects come under more scrutiny, resulting in delays, sometimes by multiple quarters or downsizing into smaller, more incremental additions. Second, the majority of our software revenue comes from term-based subscriptions, which have upfront revenue recognition. As a result, when we see a decline in new term-based subscriptions as we have in the last few quarters, it is immediately evident in our software revenue and much more so than it would be if our software was predominantly ratable or fast driven.\nNow there is some good news to point to in software. We have a base of software renewals, which is growing. Our renewal consist primarily of second term multiyear term subscriptions. And similar to Q1, in Q2, our software renewals performed largely as expected. In addition, our SaaS and managed services revenue is growing and we expect it will become a more significant and predictable contributor to our software revenue over time.\nThe spending patterns I have described were not limited to our software demand. We also experienced softer systems demand in the quarter as customers push the capacity of their existing systems, sweat their assets and work to deploy delivered systems into production. We expect these headwinds on both software and systems will persist at least through the end of this fiscal year. As a result, we now expect low to mid-single-digit revenue growth for FY '23. This is down from the 9% to 11% growth we previously forecasted.\nI will now speak to my third point, why we are confident that the current demand environment is temporary and why we are uniquely positioned to help customers simplify their hybrid multi-cloud challenges. We are confident that current demand levels are temporary for several reasons. First, because of the direct commentary we are getting from customers. Customers are telling us that the delays we are seeing are a matter of budgets and approvals, not competitive pressures or architectural shifts. During Q2, I met personally with roughly 100 customers and partners. It was clear from my discussions with customers that they expect F5 will be a key part of their future hybrid and multi-cloud architectures as the only company capable of securing and delivering applications and APIs in all environments. Partners, too, are leaning into the new F5 and our rapidly expanding set of distributed cloud services are accelerating that movement.\nSecond, because of our win rates. While the direct customer commentary is reassuring, we also consistently analyze our win rates. When we look at the first half of FY '23 compared to the first half of FY '22, we see broadly steady win rates across our theaters and product lines, confirming we continue to win our fair share of the deals we are involved in. Third, our factored pipeline, which accounts for the probability of a deal closing is up from where it's been in the last couple of quarters, suggesting customer activity is increasing and deals are reaching a higher level of maturity. This too is encouraging. But given what we have seen in the first half, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative on expected conversion of this factor pipeline.\nFourth, our strong maintenance renewal signal customers are delaying purchasing decisions by sweating assets. We see this in the substantial attach rate increase on all the deployments where you would expect the behavior of sweating assets would be most pronounced. We also are seeing a substantial increase in deferred maintenance revenue compared to prior year trends. This behavior is consistent with what we have seen during past periods of macro uncertainty, with apps and APIs continuing to grow. However, customers can only postpone investment so long if they want those apps and APIs to remain performant and secure.\nIn the meantime, we are focused on controlling the things we can control, including operating with discipline and ensuring we are prepared for when customer spending resumes. This includes reducing our cost base. We are reducing our global headcount by approximately 620 employees or approximately 9% of our total workforce. We expect these actions, combined with other cost reductions, including rationalizing our technology consumption, applying additional scrutiny to discretionary projects and reducing our facilities footprint will drive ongoing operating leverage. In addition, we are substantially reducing the size of our corporate bonus pool in 2023 and further reducing travel.\nAs a result, we expect to deliver FY '23 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 30% and non-GAAP earnings growth of 7% to 11%. Further, the leverage from these cost reductions, combined with our anticipated gross margin improvement, positions us to deliver meaningful non-GAAP operating margin expansion and double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth in FY '24. While customers are spending only were critical near term, they continue to face significant challenges ahead, including creating engaging digital experiences, managing resource constraints and addressing technical debt. Their business velocity and long-term growth will rely on finding ways to connect and protect applications and APIs across distributed environments. With our unique ability to secure and deliver applications and APIs across all environments, we are differentiated in our ability to help customers with these challenges. We believe this position will drive sustainable long-term growth.\nAs we have evaluated and adjusted our business, in addition to reducing cost, we have also intensified our investments in areas we believe will drive the highest mid- and long-term impact for our customers, including software and hybrid and multi-cloud. Now I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Francois, and hello, everyone. I will review our Q2 results before I speak to our third quarter outlook and provide additional color on our FY '23 expectations. We delivered Q2 revenue of $703 million, reflecting 11% growth year-over-year. Global Services revenue of $363 million grew a strong 8% due to the high maintenance renewals and the impacts of the price increase introduced in Q4 of last year. Our revenue remained roughly split between Global Services and Product with Global Services representing 52% of total revenue.\nProduct revenue grew 14% year-over-year, reflecting strong system shipments against an easier comparison in the year ago quarter. As Francois described, our successful redesign efforts enabled systems revenue of $209 million, representing growth of 43% year-over-year. At $132 million, Q2 software revenue was down 13% compared to last year.\nLet's take a closer look at our software revenue, which is comprised of subscription and perpetual license sales. Subscription-based revenue, which includes term subscriptions, our SaaS offerings and utility-based revenue totaled $109 million or 83% of Q2's total software revenue. Within our Q2 subscription business, as Francois described, new term subscriptions performed significantly below plan in the quarter. In contrast, and similar to last quarter, software renewals continued to perform largely in line with our expectations. Perpetual license sales of $23 million represented 17% of Q2's software revenue. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 65% of Q2's revenue.\nThis includes subscription-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue. On a regional basis, we saw growth across all theaters, though I'd note that these trends are more reflective of shipments in the quarter than current demand. Revenue from Americas grew 7% year-over-year, representing 54% of total revenue. EMEA grew a strong 22%, representing 27% of revenue, and APAC grew 9%, representing 18% of revenue.\nLooking at our major verticals. During Q2, enterprise customers represented 67% of product bookings, service providers represented 13% and government customers represented 20%, including 6% from U.S. Federal.\nI will now share our Q2 operating results. GAAP gross margin was 77.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 80.4%, in line with our guidance for the quarter. GAAP operating expenses were $441 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $374 million, in line with our guided range. Our GAAP operating margin was 15.1%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 27.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.8%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $81 million or $1.34 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $154 million or $2.53 per share, above the top end of our guided range of $2.36 to $2.48 per share. This reflects improved operating margins from strong cost discipline as well as a benefit to our tax rate in the quarter.\nI will now turn to cash flow and the balance sheet, which remains very strong. We generated $141 million in cash flow from operations in Q2. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $11 million. DSO for the quarter was 62 days, flat with Q1 and up from historical levels, primarily due to strong service maintenance contract renewals in the quarter and, to a lesser degree, back-end shipping linearity. Cash and investments totaled $760 million at quarter end. We did not repurchase any shares in Q2. We remained out of the market as we analyze the potential impacts of the cost-saving measures we discussed previously as well as the changes we were seeing in the demand environment and its effects on our outlook.\nDeferred revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, up from $1.76 billion in Q1. This increase was largely driven by substantially higher maintenance renewals on our installed base of products sold 4-plus years ago.\nFinally, we ended the quarter with approximately 7,100 employees. This number does not reflect the reductions we announced today. We expect these headcount reductions will result in annualized savings of approximately $130 million. We expect to incur approximately $45 million in severance and benefits costs and other charges related to these actions in FY '23.\nI will now share our outlook for Q3. Unless otherwise stated, my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. We expect Q3 revenue in the range of $690 million to $710 million, with gross margins of approximately 82%. With the partial quarter impact of our announced cost reductions, we estimate Q3 operating expenses of $348 million to $360 million and our Q3 non-GAAP earnings target is $2.78 to $2.90 per share. We expect Q3 share-based compensation expense of approximately $60 million to $62 million. Finally, we plan to repurchase at least $250 million worth of shares during Q3. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders and continue to expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow towards share repurchases.\nI will now speak to our FY '23 expectations. We expect low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in FY '23. Given our first half results and the environment for new software projects, we no longer see a path to 15% to 20% software growth in FY '23, and are not offering guidance for the second half product revenue mix at this time. Based on current visibility and our earlier-than-anticipated systems recovery, we expect to see lower systems revenue in Q3 and Q4 than in Q2. We expect that we will continue to substantially work down our systems backlog over the second half of FY '23. We expect FY '23 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 30% and non-GAAP earnings growth in the range of 7% to 11%. Incorporating our year-to-date results, we have narrowed our estimate for our FY '23 effective tax rate to 21% to 22% for the year. I will now turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrancois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Frank. Like last quarter, I'd ask that you take away 3 things from this call. We believe the current demand environment is temporary. And while we cannot predict when it will recover, we are confident it will, for the very simple reason that applications and APIs continue to grow. We are also confident that as customers resume more normal levels of investment and begin to take on the challenges associated with hybrid multi-cloud environments, we will be a differentiated partner for them.\nAnd finally, while we have implemented cost reductions and continue to strive to achieve double-digit earnings growth, we also have intensified our investment in areas we believe will be most impactful for our customers over the medium and long term, including software and hybrid and multi-cloud.\nOperator, please open the call to questions."

First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Suzanne DuLong. Thank you, Suzanne. You may begin.\n\nSuzanne DuLong\n\nVP of IR, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nHello, and welcome. I am Suzanne DuLong, F5's Vice President of Investor Relations. Francois Locoh-Donou, F5's President and CEO; and Frank Pelzer, F5's Executive Vice President and CFO, will be making prepared remarks on today's call. Other members of the F5 executive team are also on hand to answer questions during the Q&A session.\nA copy of today's press release is available on our website at f5.com, or an archived version of today's audio will be available through April 24, 2023. Visuals accompanying today's discussion are viewable on the webcast and will be posted to our IR site at the conclusion of our call. To access the replay of today's webcast by phone, dial (877) 660-6853 or (201) 612-7415, and use meeting ID 13735357. The telephonic replay will be available through midnight Pacific Time, January 25, 2023. For additional information or follow-up questions, please reach out to me directly at s.dulong@f5.com.\nOur discussion today will contain forward-looking statements, which include words such as believe, anticipate, expect and target. These forward-looking statements involve uncertainties and risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in the press release announcing our financial results and described in detail in our SEC filings. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Against the backdrop of a continued tough environment, our team delivered first quarter revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range and earnings per share above the high end of our range. We came into Q1, expecting we would see deteriorating close rates and that the dynamics concentrated in EMEA and APAC in Q4 would spread to North America. In Q1, we experienced heightened budget scrutiny and more pervasive deal delays across all geographies.\nThe dynamics are particularly challenging on larger transformational-type projects, which for us tend to be software focused. Like last quarter, new multiyear subscriptions were most affected. We noted last quarter that we were not planning on year-over-year growth from new software business this year. However, in Q1, it was down a double-digit percentage year-over-year.\nBased on customer feedback, we believe we are seeing the impact of financial decisions resulting from broader economic uncertainty, pervasive budget scrutiny and spending caution as opposed to technological, competitive or architectural decisions. In contrast to what we saw on new software business, software renewals performed largely as expected in the quarter.\nAt the same time, improving supply chain conditions aided our hardware revenue, making it possible for us to ship systems to waiting customers. In addition, our Q1 maintenance renewals were particularly strong, which in the past, has correlated with customers sweating assets. Despite the environment, we continue to expect 9% to 11% revenue growth for the year, albeit with a different mix than we initially forecasted.\nGiven the demand trends of the last quarter, it is challenging to call our revenue mix with precision. However, with supply chain improvements and the benefit of our system redesign efforts coming to fruition, we continue to see a second half acceleration in our systems revenue.\nIn addition, based on the solid maintenance renewals we experienced in Q1 and our forecast for Q2, we expect global services revenue will be stronger than we initially anticipated for the year. As a result, we expect the combination of stronger systems revenue and global services revenue to offset software headwinds in the year. We also continue to expect non-GAAP earnings growth in the low to mid-teens for FY '23. We remain committed to maintaining double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth this year and on an annual basis going forward, and we will continue to evaluate our cost base and take further action as needed to achieve this goal.\nIn the current environment, customers are focused on minimizing their spend and optimizing their existing investments while also continuing to drive revenue. We are confident that we are well positioned to help them do exactly that. For instance, during Q1, we closed a significant multi-cloud networking win with a Tier 1 North American service provider. The customer selected F5 distributed cloud services as the core for its next-generation managed service offering based on the platform's ability to deliver a scalable, agile and dynamic infrastructure. This is the second such win for the platform. F5 distributed cloud services makes it possible for service providers to monetize their substantial network investment, including investments in 5G. The platform enables a managed service offering that solves critical challenges for enterprise customers like simplifying the deployment and operations of applications across multi-cloud and edge environments.\nCustomers also remain focused on application security and F5 distributed cloud services is also winning security use cases.\nIn Q1, a health care customer selected our managed web application firewall and API protection solution after a proof-of-concept evaluation against both their incumbent CDN provider and a cloud-native solution. The customer selected F5 distributed cloud services because it proved more effective against threats while also being easier to manage. Our solution also met the customers' stringent regulatory requirements.\nFinally, customers are focused on total cost of ownership. As a result, we continue to drive good traction with our next-generation hardware platforms, rSeries and Velos. These next-generation platforms can dramatically reduce customers' total cost of ownership by offering cloud-like benefits for on-premises systems.\nClearly, the enterprise spending environment has changed from 6 months ago. That said, the breadth of our portfolio positions us well. The number of applications continues to grow, and those applications and the infrastructure needed to deliver, secure and manage them continue to get more complex. Customers need a partner like F5 who can help them simplify, reduce our cost of ownership and make the most of the budgets they have. Our broad solutions portfolio, combined with the consumption model flexibility we offer, squarely addresses these requirements.\nNow I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q1 results before I speak to our second quarter outlook and provide some additional color on our FY '23 expectations.\nWe delivered first quarter revenue of $700 million, reflecting 2% growth year-over-year. Global Services revenue of $360 million grew a strong 5% in part due to the high maintenance renewals, Francois mentioned and also reflecting previously announced price increases. Our revenue remained roughly split between global services and product, with product revenue down slightly year-over-year reflecting softer demand across all geographies and representing 49% of total revenue in the quarter.\nContinued supply chain improvements enabled systems revenue of $173 million, down 4% year-over-year. Q1 software revenue grew 3% to $168 million, against a tough comp last year.\nLet's take a closer look at our overall software growth. Our software revenue is comprised of subscription-based and perpetual license sales. Subscription-based revenue, which includes term subscriptions, our SaaS offerings and utility-based revenue totaled $129 million or 77% of Q1's total software revenue.\nPerpetual license sales of $38 million represented 23% of Q1 software revenue. Within our subscription business, as Francois noted, new multiyear subscriptions performed significantly below plan in Q1, while renewals performed largely as expected. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 68% of Q1's revenue. This includes revenue from term subscription, SaaS and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue.\nOn a regional basis, revenue from Americas was flat year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA grew 14%, representing 26% of revenue and APAC declined 7%, representing 16% of revenue. Enterprise customers represented 62% of product bookings in the quarter, service providers represented 21% and government customers represented 17%, including 6% from U.S. Federal.\nI will now share our Q1 operating results. GAAP gross margin was 77.9%, non-GAAP gross margin was 80.4% in line with our guidance for the quarter and below where we expect to be for the year. GAAP operating expenses were $454 million, non-GAAP operating expenses were $378 million, in line with our guided range. Our GAAP operating margin was 13%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.4%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $72 million or $1.20 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $149 million or $2.47 per share, above the top end of our guided range of $2.25 to $2.37 per share. EPS was aided in part by currency gains related to a weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter.\nI will now turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $158 million in cash flow from operations in Q1. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13 million. DSO for the quarter was 62 days. This is up from historical levels, primarily due to strong service maintenance contract renewals in the quarter and, to a lesser degree, back in shipping linearity resulting from ongoing supply chain challenges.\nCash and investments totaled approximately $668 million at quarter end, reflecting the paydown of approximately $350 million in term debt remaining from our Shape acquisition. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $40 million worth of F5 shares or approximately 263,000 shares at an average price of $152 per share. Deferred revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $1.76 billion, which is up from $1.69 billion in Q4. This increase was largely driven by particularly strong service maintenance renewal sales reflecting the trend of customers sweating their existing infrastructure while recalibrating budgets. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 7,050 employees.\nI will now share our outlook for Q2. Unless otherwise stated, my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. We expect Q2 revenue in the range of $690 million to $710 million, with gross margins of approximately 80%. We continue to expect our gross margin will improve in the second half of the year for 2 main reasons. First, we expect some of the ancillary supply chain-related costs like expedite fees will begin to abate; second, with our engineering efforts to redesign around some of the more challenged components nearing completion, we expect to be less dependent on the broker market where cost for critical parts has been exorbitant.\nWe estimate Q2 operating expenses of $368 million to $380 million, and our Q2 non-GAAP earnings target is $2.36 to $2.48 per share. We expect Q2 share-based compensation expense of approximately $64 million to $66 million. Given our Q1 results and our Q2 expectations, I also want to elaborate on our FY '23 outlook. We continue to expect revenue growth of 9% to 11% for the year.\nGiven the demand trends we have seen in the last 4 months, we expect our FY '23 revenue mix will reflect revenue contribution weighted more towards hardware and services and less towards software than we expected a quarter ago.\nOur FY '23 software growth is likely to be lower than the 15% to 20% we initially expected due to budget scrutiny and project delays, pressuring new software contracts. This is offset by the probability of stronger systems growth given supply chain improvements and the benefit of our system redesign efforts coming to fruition.\nIn addition, based on the strong maintenance renewals we experienced in Q1 and forecast for Q2. We now expect Global Services growth of mid-single digits, which is up from low to mid-single digits growth we forecasted previously. As Francois noted, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings growth in the low to mid-teens for FY '23. We remain committed to maintaining double-digit earnings growth this year and on an annual basis going forward. We will continue to evaluate our cost base and take further action as needed to achieve this goal.\nI will now turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. In closing, I would ask you to take away 3 things from this call: Number one, that despite the environment, we remain committed to delivering double-digit earnings per share growth this year and on an annual basis going forward; number two, while we believe 9% to 11% revenue growth for the year is achievable. If we get demand signals that tell us it is not, we will exercise operating discipline and adjust our cost base in order to achieve our earnings goals. And number three, we have built a strong business model with nearly 70% recurring revenue, product revenue that is split 50-50 between hardware and software and global services revenue that has proven durable.\nThe result is a diversified and resilient revenue base, which when combined with operating discipline enables us to drive revenue and earnings growth in this environment.\nOperator, please open the call to questions."

Welcome to the F5, Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) And please be advise that this call is being recorded. And finally, if anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Suzanne DuLong, Vice President, Investor Relations.

Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will speak first to our fourth quarter results before discussing fiscal year '22 and our outlook for fiscal year '23. Against the backdrop of a rapidly changing environment, our team delivered fourth quarter revenue at the top end of our guidance and earnings per share above the high end of our guided range.\nAs Q4 progressed, we witnessed increased budget scrutiny from customers and elongating selling cycles, particularly related to new projects and new architectural rollouts. These dynamics were especially evident in our Q4 software revenue. While we had a strong pipeline for new multiyear subscriptions headed into the quarter, customers' macro concerns led to lower close rates and lower software growth than we expected.\nWe had some customers pause large-scale digital transformation projects in favor of business as usual. We also had customers resized projects with more conservative initial usage estimates. And we saw foreign exchange headwinds contribute to budget and spending challenges with customers in both EMEA and APAC, including customers who delayed projects with the hope that currency would stabilize.\nConversely, Q4 marked a significant improvement in our systems revenue versus prior quarters, thanks to better availability of several critical components in the broker market. These scarce components came at higher costs, which are reflected in our Q4 product gross margins. However, our priority was and will remain fulfilling customer demand for systems, which stayed strong throughout the year. We were able to partially offset higher product costs and continued operating discipline and a favorable tax rate enabled us to outperform our Q4 earnings per share target in the quarter.\nWhen I step back and look at FY '22 as a whole, I readily acknowledge that the year did not look the way we envisioned when we began it. Despite supply chain challenges and growing customer caution beginning in Q4, we saw persistent customer demand and our sales teams drove record-breaking bookings for the year. In addition, we achieved several important milestones. First, with portfolio and consumption model diversification, we drove our product mix to 51-49 software hardware, a noteworthy accomplishment in our transformation journey and very different from where we were just 5 years ago when software represented less than 15% of our product revenue; second, with the expansion of our application security portfolio and increasing demand for securing applications and APIs, we have grown our security business to $1 billion in revenue.\nSecurity-related revenue now represented 37% of our FY '22 total revenue; third, 69% of our total revenue was recurring in FY '22 with a double-digit 3-year compound annual growth rate. Over time, higher levels of recurring revenue will continue to add predictability and stability to our model. Finally, we launched 3 significant new platforms during the year, leveraging customer-focused innovation across the continuum of deployment models.\nThese launches included expanding and unifying our SaaS offerings through F5 distributed cloud services as well as our next-generation rSeries and VELOS systems. These milestones are representative of how significantly we have evolved F5 over the last 5 years. F5 is stronger and better balanced with a more resilient revenue base and an operating model capable of delivering significant leverage. Over the next year, our business is likely to benefit from tailwinds to our systems business as a result of improving component availability.\nIt's also likely to bear some weight from macroeconomic headwinds. In the balance, we expect to deliver FY '23 revenue growth of 9% to 11%. We also expect the combination of revenue growth and operating leverage will enable us to deliver non-GAAP earnings growth in the low to mid-teens, which means we also expect to deliver on our Rule of 40 benchmark in FY '23. Further, we are committed to operating the business to maintain the Rule of 40 and double-digit earnings growth on an annual basis going forward.\nFrank will speak to our outlook in greater detail in his remarks. Before I pass the call to him though, I will talk to several of the reasons why we believe we will deliver strong revenue and earnings growth this year. First, hybrid IT is here to stay. Our multi-cloud infrastructure-agnostic approach means we can create a more unified experience across customers' disparate environments. We are enhancing automation and driving operational efficiencies and corresponding cost efficiencies. Our ability to create a more seamless application environment for our customers is already an advantage. It is likely to become even more so as customers look to reduce operating costs and complexity; second, demand for security use cases is likely to remain resilient.\nCustomers rely on our security solutions, including DDoS protection, advanced vulnerability defense with web application firewall and bot fraud abuse and API protection to protect them across what feels like an ever-increasing attack surface. With the February launch of our SaaS-based F5 distributed cloud services, we are now a form-factor in a rapidly growing segment of the overall security market; third, we expect the combination of a resilient systems business and gradually improving component supply will contribute to drive systems revenue growth in fiscal year '23.\nBeyond 2023, with customers embracing hybrid IT, we expect hardware demand will prove more resilient and longer lived than expected just a few years ago. Near term, we also see the opportunity to take share from traditional hardware competitors undergoing structural change; fourth, our breadth of form factors and consumption models makes us an ideal partner for customers who are likely to be prioritizing their investments, optimizing costs and may want to shift from one consumption model to another, whether hardware, software, SaaS or managed service, perpetual license or subscription via an OpEx or CapEx budget approach, we are flexible.\nIn an environment of shifting priorities, removing friction and enabling customers to consume how and when they want is a distinct advantage. And finally, we are a trusted and operationalized partner of the largest enterprises, service providers and government entities around the world. In good times and especially when faced with adversity, organizations tend to rely heavily on the partners they know and trust. We have worked for decades to earn that trust.\nOur customers count on us on our deep understanding of how to protect and optimize their application and on our continuous innovation. It's these factors, among others, including our very sticky installed base and our growing base of recurring revenue, which helped give us confidence in our outlook for next year.\nBefore I conclude, I will highlight 2 interesting customer use cases from Q4. The first is an example of a multiyear subscription renewal with a sizable expansion. In this case, a customer, a global retailer had a goal of automatically flexing its capacity into its public cloud environments as spiky traffic demands warranted.\nThe customer augmented its existing on-premise big IP hardware with scalable virtualized BIG-IP software in the public cloud. With our deep automation capabilities, we fully automated the deployment and configuration of the F5 stack, enabling them to burst capacity as needed. Automation also simplified how their developers consume infrastructure and best-of-breed cloud services.\nIn an example of an F5 distributed cloud services SaaS win in the quarter, we worked with a global transport company based in South America that needed to protect its multi-cloud applications, but did not want the complexity or inefficiency of disparate cloud native services.\nThe customer selected F5 distributed cloud services as a one-stop comprehensive security solution, including web application firewall, advanced bot defense, API security and DDoS. With F5, the customer gained more consistent security across its multi-cloud environments, improved protection against bots and is now more self-sufficient for its security and traffic management with a single platform to support expansion to other regions.\nIn both of these use case examples, F5 delivered automated multi-cloud solutions that dramatically simplified our customers' operations and improved their ability to scale their businesses. And we did so with a form-factor and consumption model that best fit their needs.\nNow I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q4 results before moving on to briefly recap FY '22 results. I will then speak to our FY '23 and first quarter outlook. We delivered fourth quarter revenue of $700 million, reflecting 3% growth year-over-year with 3% product revenue growth and 2% global services growth. Product revenue represented 50% of total revenue in the quarter and was split 49% software, 51% systems. Q4 software revenue grew 13% to $172 million, systems revenue of $178 million was down 5% year-over-year. Rounding out our revenue picture, global service delivered $350 million in revenue.\nLet's take a closer look at our software growth. Our software revenue is comprised of subscription-based and perpetual license sales. Subscription-based revenue, which includes term subscriptions, our SaaS offerings and utility-based revenue totaled $131 million or 76% of Q4's total software revenue, the remaining 24% or $41 million came from perpetual license sales. Let's talk first about subscriptions and their performance in the quarter, multiyear subscription renewals and our SaaS solutions performed as expected.\nHowever, as Francois noted, as the quarter progressed, we began to see increased budget scrutiny from customers and elongating selling cycles, particularly related to new projects and new architectural rollouts. While we had a strong pipeline of new multiyear subscriptions headed into the quarter, these dynamics led to lower close rates on new deals. We believe budget pressures also led to a strong mix of perpetual software sales in Q4 with an increasing number of customers preferring CapEx-based consumption models. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions, SaaS and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 67% of revenue in Q4.\nOn a regional basis, Americas delivered 6% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 61% of total revenue. EMEA declined 3%, representing 23% of revenue, and APAC declined 2%, representing 17% of revenue. Enterprise customers represented 66% of product bookings in the quarter. Service providers represented 13% and government customers represented 21%, including 12% from U.S. Federal. I will now share our Q4 operating results.\nGAAP gross margin was 78.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 81.4%. This was below our guidance of 82% to 83% as a result of the higher systems revenue mix in the quarter and higher costs associated with procuring and expediting critical components in the broker market. GAAP operating expense was $445 million. Non-GAAP operating expense was $379 million, in line with our guided range. Our GAAP operating margin was 15.4%.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin was 27.3%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14.1%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $89 million or $1.49 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $158 million or $2.62 per share.\nI will now turn to cash flow and balance sheet. We generated $154 million in cash flow from operations in Q4. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million. DSO for the quarter was 60 days. Similar to last quarter, this is up from historical levels due to the back-end shipping linearity in the quarter resulting from ongoing supply chain challenges. Cash and investments totaled approximately $894 million at quarter end. Deferred revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $1.69 billion, up from $1.64 billion in Q3.\nThis increase was largely driven by subscriptions and SaaS bookings growth and, to a lesser extent, deferred service maintenance. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 7,090 employees. I will now briefly recap our FY '22 results. For the year, revenue grew 3% to $2.7 billion.\nProduct revenue of $1.3 billion grew 6% from the prior year and accounted for 49% of total revenue. As Francois noted, we achieved a significant milestone in the year, with software representing 51% of product revenue. Software revenue grew 33% to $665 million for the year, while systems revenue declined 13% to $652 million.\nGlobal services grew 2% to $1.4 billion. FY '22 software growth came from both subscriptions and perpetual license growth. Since FY '19, we have driven total software revenue growth at a 41% compounded annual growth rate, subscription software at a 58% compounded annual growth rate and perpetual license at a 10% annual growth rate. In FY '22, revenue from term-based subscription models, including renewals and inter-term expansions or true-forwards continue to represent the majority of our software subscription revenue.\nWith the launch of F5 distributed cloud services in February, we have introduced a new growth vector for our software business with a SaaS-based consumption model. We are thrilled with the early customer traction for the platform, but scaling ratable SaaS revenue takes time. We are transitioning all of our previously available SaaS services, including solutions from Shape and Silverline managed services to F5 distributed cloud services, creating a unified delivery platform for customers. We fully expect F5 distributed cloud will be a meaningful contributor to our revenue in the future.\nWe will look to disclose both its revenue contribution and other relevant ratable revenue metrics as the business grows and matures. Our software revenue growth is driving us towards a higher recurring revenue base. In FY '22, 69% of our revenue was recurring, up from 66% in FY '21 and reflecting an 11% compound annual growth rate since FY '19.\nWe closed FY '22 with approximately $231 million in product backlog, the vast majority of which is systems based. This is up more than 80% from approximately $125 million in product backlog in FY '21. While backlog orders are cancelable, we continue to see very low to nonexistent cancellation rates.\nTwo years ago, we began disclosing the portion of our revenue derived from security solutions. Francois mentioned, we delivered $1 billion in security revenue in FY '22, representing 37% of total revenue. We estimate our stand-alone security product revenue, which includes solutions sold exclusively for security use cases in either software SaaS or hardware deployment models, grew to approximately $440 million. This reflects a 30% compounded annual growth rate since FY '19.\nI will now turn to our FY '22 operating performance. GAAP gross margin in FY '22 was 80%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 82.6%. Our GAAP operating margin in FY '22 was 15% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.9%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 16.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 18.1%. Our FY '22 annual tax rate was lower than expected primarily due to a dispute benefit from filing our fiscal year 2021 state income tax returns.\nGAAP net income for FY '22 was $322 million or $5.27 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $623 million or $10.19 per share. I will now share our outlook for FY '23. Unless otherwise stated, my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. As Francois noted, we expect to deliver 9% to 11% revenue growth in FY '23. This view incorporates a balance between tailwinds to our systems business from gradually improving component availability during the year and macroeconomic headwinds.\nIt also factors in current customer caution. In FY '23, we expect the dynamics around budget scrutiny and caution around new projects will be similar to what we experienced in Q4. As a result, we expect software growth of 15% to 20% for the year.\nWe expect systems revenue growth in FY '23 with growth weighted towards the second half when supply chain risk related to critical components begins to abate. Finally, we expect low to mid-single-digit revenue growth from our global services. Shifting to our operating model, we expect supply chain pressures to remain acute in the first half of the year and to gradually improve in the second half.\nThis dynamic will impact our FY '23 operating model trends, likely outweighing our usual seasonality. Specifically, revenue, gross margin and operating margin expansion are expected to be more weighted in Q3 and Q4 of FY '23. We expect FY '23 gross margins of approximately 81% with the combination of moderating supply chain cost and price realization from our previously announced price increases flowing through as we progress through the year.\nWe expect continued operating expense discipline will result in non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 30% to 31% for the year. We expect our FY '23 effective tax rate will be 21% to 23%. And we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth in the low to mid-teens for the year. As Francois noted, with results in these ranges, we would achieve our Rule of 40 target for FY '23.\nWe are committed to maintaining it and double-digit earnings growth going forward on an annual basis. Our FY '23 outlook incorporates the expectation that we will allocate 50% of our free cash flow for the year to share repurchases, consistent with our balanced approach and the commitment we made at our last Analyst Day.\nIncluded in this expectation is that we pay down the $350 million remaining on our term loan related to the Shape acquisition when it matures in January of 2023. I will now speak to our outlook for Q1 FY '23. We expect Q1 revenue in the range of $690 million to $710 million with gross margin of approximately 80%. We estimate Q1 operating expenses of $370 million to $382 million.\nAnd our Q1 non-GAAP earnings target is $2.25 to $2.37 per share. We expect Q1 share-based compensation expense of approximately $61 million to $63 million. I will now turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. To reiterate a few key points. We believe we are positioned to deliver FY '23 revenue and earnings growth, we are well aligned with our customers' most pressing application challenges, including easing the complexity of protecting increasingly distributed applications and managing and scaling complex hybrid IT environments.\nWith a $1 billion and growing security business and an increasing mix of SaaS-based solutions, we are well positioned for the future. Our innovation and successful transformation efforts to date have substantially expanded our portfolio, driving balance in our hardware-software mix.\nAs a result, we have a stronger business model and increased confidence in our ability to deliver sustained revenue and earnings growth. In the balance of what we see are likely both tailwinds resulting from improving component availability and macroeconomic headwinds in FY '23, we expect to deliver meaningful top line growth and double-digit earnings growth. In FY '23 and beyond, we expect to continue to exercise operating discipline, driving to the Rule of 40 and double-digit growth on a sustainable basis annually. This concludes our prepared remarks today. Operator, would you please open the call to Q&A?"

These forward-looking statements involve uncertainties and risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in the press release announcing our financial results and described in detail in our SEC filings. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. In Q3, we delivered above the midpoint of our revenue guidance and well above the top end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Software growth of 38% drove 4% revenue growth year-over-year, partially offsetting continued supply chain constraints for systems. Overall, we delivered 5% product revenue growth. While supply chain challenges continue to limit our ability to ship systems, our demand signals remain strong, and we remain ahead of our initial FY '22 demand plan.\nWhile we have not seen meaningful improvement in supply volumes in the last 3 months, we also have not seen further deterioration. In general, our suppliers' commitment held up better in Q3 than in previous 2 quarters. Based on what we see today, we continue to expect our ability to ship systems will improve during our second quarter of fiscal 2023 as a result of our efforts to design out the most constrained component and the additional capacity our key suppliers expect beginning in the last calendar quarter of 2022. We likewise continue to expect that fiscal Q1 2023 will be the low point in systems revenue.\nWe continue to see our growth opportunity fundamentally tied to applications, to the growing number of apps as well as increased usage and heightened business value. In Q3, we saw strong demand as customers added, scaled and secured their applications with demand for security and from our service provider vertical, fueling sales in the quarter. In fact, security concerns continue to drive the majority of our customer engagement with demand showing up in both software and hardware form factors and across multiple consumption models.\nIn one example from Q3, an existing BIG-IP hardware customer and one of the world's largest banking and financial services organizations turned to F5 when a large 4G incident revealed other vendor solutions were insufficiently protecting against (inaudible). As a strategic partner, F5 demonstrated that our advanced web application firewall provided immediate protection against current and future vulnerabilities.\nAlso during Q3, a large global retailer turned to F5 after experiencing challenges with their existing bot defense provider over a head-to-head 3-month proof of concept against their current solution, our distributed cloud bot and risk solution demonstrated significantly higher efficacy, and the customer is now deploying F5 to protect their apps and their customers.\nWe have said previously that our customers are increasingly operating both traditional and modern architectures and looking to F5 to unite their strategies and simplify their operations. In the latest example of this trend, during Q3, an American multinational financial services corporation selected a combination of BIG-IP and NGINX to secure and process their high volume of critical encrypted transactions globally.\nLast quarter, I also spotlighted our new SaaS offering, F5 Distributed Cloud Services, which we launched in February. With this platform, we are delivering security, multi-cloud networking and edge-based computing solutions on a unified Software-as-a-Service platform. While it is still very early, we are seeing good traction in customer interest. During Q3, a global company specializing in clinical services and customizable medical devices selected our web application firewall and API protection solution to ensure rapid deployment of their security policy at scale and to provide global delivery of services in a hybrid multi-region support model or via SaaS.\nFinally, service providers drove demand in the quarter as customers scale and secure 4G cores and begin to move 5G cores into production. In one win in the quarter, we expanded our carrier-grade firewall business with a North American service provider as they continue to grow both their 4G and 5G traffic.\nIn another service provider win, we expanded our offerings with an APAC-based customer to include BIG-IP cloud-native network functions for its 5G mobile core. These recently introduced cloud-native functions are perfect for moving workloads from legacy NFV to a modern cloud-native architecture. Cloud-native functions enable service providers and large enterprises to realize the full benefit of the cloud, automating and simplifying their operations with a more secure, more scalable network.\nBefore I turn the call to Frank to review our Q3 results and our Q4 outlook, I will comment on the macro environment. As I said previously, we saw strong demand in Q3 and we've got a strong Q4 pipeline. At the same time, we also observed more back-end linearity in Q3, and our sales teams have noted some instances where more approvals were required to close deals. While we are not seeing it today, we believe the combination of macro uncertainty and inflation will put pressure on customer budgets and eventually force customers to reprioritize investments. We will continue to closely monitor signals from our customers. And like others, we are assessing adjustments we would make in the event that the environment or our customers turn more cautious.\nWe have built a stronger and more resilient F5 by expanding our solutions portfolio and our consumption models. As a result of our business transformation, F5 is positioned to benefit both from software growth drivers, including BIG-IP, NGINX, and our F5 Distributed Cloud Services SaaS offerings, and what we expect will be persistent demand for systems. As a result of our successful transformation efforts to date, we have a stronger business model that increases our confidence in our ability to deliver sustained revenue and earnings growth.\nNow I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q3 results before discussing our Q4 outlook. We delivered third quarter revenue of $674 million, reflecting a 4% growth year-over-year with 5% product growth. Product revenue represented 48% of total revenue in the quarter, and software represented 55% of product revenue. This is the second quarter in a row where the majority of our product revenue has come from software. Software revenue grew 38% to $179 million. Systems revenue of $148 million declined 18% year-over-year due to ongoing supply chain challenges and resulting shipment delays. Similar to Q2, we added systems backlog of tens of millions of dollars in Q3.\nRounding out our revenue picture, global services delivered $348 million in Q3 revenue, up 2% from the prior year. Taking a closer look at our software revenue. Subscription-based revenue contributed 82% of total software revenue in the quarter, a new high.\nTerm-based subscriptions continue to represent over half of our subscription revenue with smaller but growing contributions from Software-as-a-Service and utility consumption models. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions, Software-as-a-Service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 72% of revenue in the quarter. This is another milestone for us and is up from 66% in the year ago period.\nOn a regional basis, Americas delivered 5% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA declined 7%, representing 23% of revenue, and APAC grew 15%, representing 19% of revenue. I'll remind you that given current supply chain constraints, our geographic revenue distribution in a quarter is not fully indicative of demand for each given region.\nEnterprise customers represented 70% of product bookings in the quarter. Service providers represented 18% and government customers represented 12%, including 3% from U.S. Federal.\nI will now share our Q3 operating results. GAAP gross margin was 80.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was above our guide at 83.2%. While we continue to experience increased component prices, expedite fees and other sourcing-related costs, our Q3 gross margin reflects some improvement in average selling price on systems in the quarter. We are not ready to say it's a trend, but we are encouraged about the overall direction.\nGAAP operating expenses were $436 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $367 million. This is lower than our guided range as a result of some investments we delayed in anticipation of potential macro headwinds that did not materialize in the quarter and lower international expenses related to the strengthening dollar.\nOur GAAP operating margin was 15.9%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 18%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.4%, largely driven by a nonrecurring benefit associated with the filing of our federal income tax return during the quarter.\nGAAP net income for the quarter was $83 million or $1.37 per share. Our better-than-guided gross and operating margin performance and lower tax rate contributed to non-GAAP net income of $155 million or $2.57 per share.\nI will now turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $71 million in cash flow from operations in Q3. This is net of more than $30 million of payments to partners related to securing component inventory to support future hardware builds and component expedite fees. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million. DSO for the quarter was 61 days. Similar to last quarter, this is up from historical levels due to back-ended shipping linearity in the quarter resulting from supply chain challenges. Cash and investments totaled approximately $757 million at quarter end.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately $250 million worth of F5 shares or approximately 1.5 million shares at an average price of $171 per share. Deferred revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $1.64 billion, up from $1.60 billion in Q2, largely driven by subscriptions and SaaS bookings growth and, to a lesser extent, deferred service maintenance.\nFinally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,900 employees.\nI will now share our outlook for the fourth quarter. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. We expect Q4 revenue in the range of $680 million to $700 million. Our pipeline indicates Q4 demand that would put our software revenue growth towards the high end of our 35% to 40% target for the year. As Francois discussed, however, we are very cognizant of the broader, more cautious environment. And as a result, we see more risk at the top end of our software growth range than there was a quarter ago.\nGiven the Q3 strength in global services, we now expect global services revenue to grow approximately 1.5% to 2% for the year. We expect Q4 gross margins in a range of 82% to 83%. We are seeing component costs continue to rise and expect that they will be higher still next year. As a result, we implemented an approximately 15% price increase in systems effective July 1. Given our backlog, we expect it will take some quarters for the price increase to manifest into sustainable gross margin improvements.\nWe estimate Q4 operating expenses of $374 million to $386 million, which would put our FY '22 operating margin at approximately 29%, an improvement of 100 to 200 basis points from our prior outlook. Factoring in the tax rate benefit from Q3, we now expect FY '22 effective tax rate will be approximately 19%.\nOur Q4 earnings target is $2.45 to $2.57 per share. We expect Q4 share-based compensation expense of approximately $61 million to $63 million. Finally, as we announced in the earnings press release, our Board authorized an additional $1 billion for our share repurchase program. This new authorization is incremental to the $272 million remaining in the existing program. As we have over the last 2 years, we expect to continue to balance share repurchases with other strategic uses of cash.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks today. Operator, would you please open the call to Q&A?"

Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you all know, we entered our second quarter with some significant challenges that limited our ability to fulfill demand from our systems business. We are pleased to have delivered above the midpoint of our revenue guidance and at the upper end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance despite those challenges.\nImportantly, we continued to deliver strong results on our software business with 40% year-over-year growth in the quarter, software represented the majority of our product revenue for the first time. Systems revenue declined 27% as a result of supply chain constraints and our global services revenue was flat year-over-year.\nOur second quarter reflected another in an ongoing trend where customers continued to rapidly grow and scale both their traditional and modern applications, while placing increased importance and focus on application security. This benefits F5 and translates to continued strong demand across our portfolio. While our view towards strong demand drivers remains clear, our visibility into resolution of hardware supply chain challenges is murky.\nGoing into Q2, we discussed 2 primary supply chain challenges. I am happy to report that we successfully resolved the first, which was related to standard electronic components and required us to design in and qualify an alternative source.\nThe second challenge we discussed is related to global shortages of specialty semiconductor components. While we have made some incremental progress on this issue, we continue to expect supply constraints will limit our ability to fulfill systems demand through the end of this fiscal year. Part of our efforts to fulfill system demand included shifting customers from our iSeries appliances to our next-generation rSeries appliances, which launched in February. We are seeing solid traction in rSeries sales, and we are ramping manufacturing.\nHowever, semiconductor constraints, primarily from a handful of suppliers, continued to limit our ability to ship iSeries and are now also impacting our ability to accelerate the ramp of rSeries. As a result, our systems revenue recovery has been delayed beyond the expectations we had last quarter. Frank will review our outlook in detail later in our prepared remarks. But as a result of the delayed systems revenue recovery, we now expect to deliver fiscal year 2022 revenue growth in the range of 1.5% to 4%. This compares to our prior expectations for 4.5% to 8% growth.\nOur underlying demand remains strong, however, and we continue to expect to deliver software revenue growth near the top end of our 35% to 40% target for the year. In light of the sustained strength of our demand and our view that the supply chain constraints are temporary, we are not making changes to our operating structure. And therefore, our margins will be impacted correspondingly in near term.\nWe obviously feel a strong sense of frustration with this change and an equally strong sense of urgency towards resolution so we can get back to reflecting the true health of the business in our reported results. We are taking every available path to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. Our suppliers expect additional capacity beginning in the last calendar quarter of 2022, which should translate into improvement during our second quarter for fiscal 2023.\nWhile the supply chain challenges are more severe than we estimated last quarter, they are temporary. In addition to seeing continued demand for hardware, we are seeing good traction across our software portfolio, including from security use cases and our ability to bring a broader solutions portfolio to customers. I will speak to our business momentum and demand drivers before Frank reviews the quarter's results and our outlook in detail.\nOur customers are increasingly operating in both traditional and modern architectures and looking to F5 for solutions that simplify and unite their strategies for both. As an example, during Q2, an American multinational beverage company and a longtime big IP customer selected NGINX to service cloud and Kubernetes-based workloads and modern use cases. The customer is using NGINX to automate app content delivery, including its loyalty program and delivery services, both of which have experienced substantial growth during the pandemic.\nThe addition of NGINX technologies to the customer's multiyear subscription resulted in a 2x expansion of the subscription upon renewal. Customers also are operating in multiple clouds and uncovering new challenges as a result. F5's infrastructure-agnostic approach through application security and delivery differentiates us from vendors who are siloed to a single environment. This means we are uniquely positioned to help customers with their multi-cloud challenges.\nDuring Q2, we were selected by the Ministry of Health for a nation in our APAC region. Not being locked into a single cloud was an important consideration for this customer. They had intentions of modernizing in a single cloud short term the plan to expand to additional clouds in the near future. This customer selected F5 over cloud-native offerings as a result of our solutions clear value add and our cloud-agnostic capabilities.\nWe enable the customer to create a true multi-cloud architecture with both on-premises and cloud environment in a deal spanning our portfolio, including BIG-IP hardware and software with advanced WAF, and NGINX, including App Protect and API management.\nFinally, it's clear that hybrid architecture, including on-premises data centers and as-a-service offerings are here to stay. Applications and workloads also are increasingly containerized and mobile. This means complexity is here to stay too and that managing applications across disparate environments will remain a challenge for customers.\nMeeting that challenge is likely to require a distributed cloud architecture and platform-agnostic security and delivery technologies that provide consistent protection, visibility and performance for all applications, legacy, modern and mobile across environments.\nIn Q2, we took a large step forward towards helping customers better manage multi-cloud complexities with the launch of our F5 distributed cloud services. With this platform, we are delivering security, multi-cloud networking and edge-based computing solutions on a unified Software-as-a-Service platform.\nOur first solution for the platform, F5 distributed cloud web application and API protection or WAP, augments multiple security capabilities across F5 technologies in a SaaS offering. This offering reflects the first major step in our integration of our Volterra platform and F5 software security stack.\nF5 distributed cloud services is globally available and we are seeing strong early enterprise and service provider interest. SoftBank announced one of the first notable wins for F5 distributed cloud this quarter. The Corporate Information Technology division of SoftBank needed to improve low resource utilization and other inefficiencies of its private virtualized infrastructure. But its security requirements mandated on-premises deployment with an option for future public cloud capabilities. It sought a way to bring the effectiveness of cloud-native micro services and containers to its private data center and turn to F5 distributed cloud services.\nWe are leveraging F5 distributed cloud branding to further integrate customers' experience with F5 by simplifying our product meaning. You will see we have united and renamed our SaaS and managed services portfolio, including Shape, Volterra and Silverline under our F5 distributed cloud services umbrella. So expect to hear us refer to those solutions accordingly going forward.\nIn summary, despite our short-term supply chain challenges, there is a lot to look forward to from F5. We have multiple current and future software drivers that are well aligned with our customers' most pressing application needs between BIG-IP's ability to serve and secure traditional apps, NGINX's ability to serve and secure modern apps and the exciting opportunity to grow and expand F5 distributed cloud services, we are well placed to enable our customers to manage and secure their growing and rapidly evolving application estate.\nNow I will turn the call to Frank to review our Q2 results and our second half outlook in detail. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q2 results before discussing our second half outlook.\nWe delivered second quarter revenue of $634 million, above the midpoint of our guidance range and reflecting a 2% decline year-over-year. Software revenue grew 40% to $152 million. Systems revenue declined 27% to $146 million. We delivered a 4% product revenue decline year-over-year, with product revenue representing 47% of total revenue in the quarter and software contributing 51% of product revenue. Rounding out our revenue picture, Global Services delivered $337 million in revenue. This is flat compared to last year and represented 53% of total revenue.\nTaking a closer look at our software revenue. Subscription-based revenue represented 75% of total software revenue in the quarter. This is down a bit from the 80% mix, where it had been in the last couple of quarters, but we do not see this as indicative of a trend. Rather, it reflects some activation timing variability for a couple of large multiyear subscription agreements as well as a small number of larger deals in the quarter where customers preferred a CapEx model.\nAs a reminder, a significant component of our subscription business is term-based licenses that are not recognized ratably, and as such, we expect some quarter-to-quarter variability. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions as a service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 69% of revenue in the quarter. This is up from 64% in the year ago period.\nOn a regional basis, Americas delivered 4% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA declined 9%, representing 25% of revenue, and APAC declined 6%, representing 19% of revenue. In the quarter, we saw some signs of softness in EMEA. We believe this is in part related to the macro and global political concerns in the region.\nEnterprise customers represented 65% of product bookings in the quarter. Service providers represented 15% and government customers represented 20%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.\nI will now share our Q2 operating results. GAAP gross margin was 80.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 82.9%. We continue to experience increased component prices, expedite fees and other sourcing-related costs. GAAP operating expenses were $433 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $358 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 11.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5%.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.3%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $56 million or $0.92 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $131 million or $2.13 per share.\nI will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $127 million in cash flow from operations in Q2. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $5 million. DSO for the quarter was 59 days. Cash and investments totaled approximately $922 million at quarter end.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately $125 million worth of F5 shares or approximately 610,000 shares at an average price of $205. Deferred revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $1.60 billion, up from $1.58 billion in Q1. The growth in total deferred was largely driven by subscriptions and SaaS bookings growth and, to a lesser extent, deferred service maintenance.\nFinally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,700 employees, up approximately 150 from Q1. Francois shared our updated fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook in his remarks. I will recap the details of the second half outlook with you now. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics.\nI will begin with our revised view for fiscal 2022. Given persistent and dynamic supply chain pressures, which are limiting our systems revenue recovery near term, we expect to deliver fiscal year 2022 revenue growth within the range of 1.5% to 4% for the year. This compares to our prior expectations of 4.5% to 8% growth. We continue to expect to deliver close to the top end of our 35% to 40% software revenue growth target for the year. We expect Global Services growth of approximately 1% to 1.5% for the year, reflecting the lower expected range of system sales.\nBecause we believe the current supply chain challenges are temporary and do not reflect the underlying growth of the business, we do not intend to adjust our operating model near term. We believe doing so would risk compromising our ability to deliver future revenue growth. As a result, we are likely to see operating margin pressure over the next several quarters.\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 27% to 28% for FY '22. We would expect to regain the Rule of 40 operating benchmark as we return to full manufacturing capacity. We continue to expect our full fiscal year effective tax rate will be in the range of 20% to 21% with some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. We remain committed to repurchasing 500 million in shares during the fiscal year.\nI will now move to our third quarter expectations. We expect Q3 revenue in the range of $660 million to $680 million. Given component costs and the costs related to actions we are taking to mitigate supply chain pressures, we expect Q3 gross margins of approximately 82%. We estimate Q3 operating expenses of $368 million to $380 million. Our Q3 earnings target is $2.18 to $2.30 per share. We expect Q3 share-based compensation expense of approximately $63 million to $65 million.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. In closing, we will continue doing everything in our power to mitigate supply chain impact for our customers. While supply chain is currently overshadowing the underlying strength of our business, we believe constraints will begin to abate as we move through the next several quarters. Our software and Software-as-a-Service app security and delivery solutions will drive our future growth and our long-term opportunity.\nWe have created a portfolio and a road map that is well aligned with our customers' strategic priorities. And because of that, we are more confident than ever in our position, our strategy and our long-term opportunity.\nWith that, operator, we will open the call to Q&A."

Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call. With that, I will turn the call over to Francois.\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate our customers need to grow and evolve the applications that support and drive their businesses.\nCustomer demand (inaudible) our portfolio, driving 10% revenue growth in Q1 and and our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Underpinning our top line growth is robust 47% software growth, 1% systems growth and 2% global services growth in the quarter.\nIn fact, both software and systems demand exceeded our expectations in Q1, contributing to our outperformance. We are at the epicenter of digital transformation and application security. We are differentiated by our focus, expertise and the vision and technology assets to secure and deliver any application anywhere.\nAs a result, we have seen strengthening demand across our software portfolio and persistent strong demand for our systems. (inaudible) in the industry since late 2020 and we have been taking progressively more aggressive steps to manage supply chain risks.\nThese include preordering components, investing to secure supply, qualifying and sourcing alternate components and purchasing on the open market to fill gaps that arise. Over the last year, stronger-than-expected demand for systems, coupled with ongoing supply chain constraints have gated our systems revenue growth.\nAs a result of persistent strong system demand, our systems backlog continued to grow in Q1. Over the last 30 days, suppliers of critical components that span a number of our platforms have informed us of significant increases in decommits.\nThese came in the fall of both order delivery delays and sudden and pronounced reduction in shipment quantities. The step function decline in component availability is significantly restricting our ability to meet our customers' continued strong demand for our systems.\nThe challenges in Q2, and we expect Q2 revenue in the range of $610 million to $650 million as a result. This revenue range reflects a $60 million to $80 million shortfall in our ability to ship in our second quarter versus what we would have expected absent these recent supply chain constraints. Based on the information we have today, we estimate that increased supply chain limitations are likely to have a net $30 million to $90 million impact to our prior revenue guidance for fiscal year 2022.\nWe are aggressively working to mitigate the impact of 2 primary gating supply challenges near term. First, like others in the industry, we are seeing worsening availability of specialized networking chipsets. Within the last 30 days, we have learned that deliveries for 52-week lead time components or at a year ago, have been pushed out and that our expected quantities have been reduced.\nSecond, we also have experienced significant decommits for standard semiconductor components. We are working to design and qualify replacement components to resolve these standard component challenges. While we are unlikely to be able to do so in time to mitigate production shortfalls in Q2, we expect that we can mitigate the impact on the second half of our fiscal year.\nIn addition to continuing to work with our suppliers, our sales teams also will be working with customers to fulfill their demand with alternative offerings. In some cases, customers may be able to qualify and ship demand to recently introduce platforms that are less affected by supply chain issues because they use more readily available components.\nNow let me be very clear. The main drivers across our business are stronger than they have ever been. While near-term supply chain challenges made a swap our revenue growth trajectory short term. Fundamentally, we did not change the significant opportunity we have to solve our customers' most critical application security and delivery challenges, nor will exchange our longer-term growth potential.\nOur software transition continues to gain momentum. In fact, we now expect to be closer to the top end of our 35% to 40% software revenue growth range for the year. In addition, systems demand exceeded our plan in Q1 and remained strong headed into Q2 because of the strong demand signals we see and our confidence in our longer-term trajectory, we will continue to invest responsibly in our business and will not make any dramatic changes to our operating model short term.\nWhile this will mean near-term pressure on our operating margin, it best positions us to continue to capture our growth opportunity and long-term earnings potential. We expect to return to our previously forecasted operating margin profile as we return to full manufacturing capacity. Our Q1 customer wins offered great insights to both our momentum and the opportunity ahead.\nFor instance, for basic application security threat, like Log4j clearly demonstrated why every application needs web application firewall protection. As a result, we are seeing heightened interest in F5's WAF solution for both traditional and modern applications.\nIn just 1 example, during Q1, a customer selected NGINX with (inaudible) to add vast protection closer to the containers deployed by its DevOps teams. This is in addition to the advanced (inaudible) operated by its traditional SecOps team. We also see growing demand for fraud and bot defense.\nAs an example, in Q1, one of Central America's most prominent banks was still struggling with data security despite deploying multiple security solutions. The bank selected our solution to defend the gin persistent automated attacks.\nShape dramatically reduced the customers' automated traffic, successfully reducing consumer friction across their digital channels. Shape is also providing broad-based analytics for improved application security and visibility. Finally, customers' modern applications are moving into production and experiencing significant and constant swings in user demand.\nAs a result, they need infrastructure that scales up automatically to make user demands or down to save cloud costs. For instance, during Q1, an American multinational investment bank and financial services customer selected NGINX to help modernize the cumene as applications. The customer's existing solution was unable to provide multisite resiliency for a service running within Kubernetes clusters.\nThe customer selected NGINX to provide multi-cluster, multi-site sale-over. Customers are increasingly looking to F5 to help them solve an escalating volume of application security and delivery challenges and multi-trial challenges and modern app challenges like scaling Kubernetes-based apps into production.\nThese challenges and the complexity they entail are only mounting for our customers. We see F5 as an innovator, uniquely equipped to help them build and scale both the traditional and modern application environments. And the cloud-ready capabilities we are building with our Volterra and Threat Stack integrations only enhance our positioning and appeal. I'll now turn the call to Frank to review our Q1 results and our outlook. Frank?\n\nFrancis J. Pelzer\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review our Q1 results before providing our Q2 outlook and updated fiscal year 2022 guidance. As Francois outlined, our team delivered another very strong Q1. First quarter revenue of $687 million is up 10% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range.\nPlease note, as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures for the year ago period. Q1 product revenue of $343 million is up 19% year-over-year, representing 50% of total revenue.\nQ1 software revenue grew 47% to $163 million representing 47% of product revenue, up from 38% in the year ago period. Systems revenue of $180 million is up 1% compared to Q1 last year. Rounding out our revenue picture, we see continued strength from our global services with $344 million in Q1 revenue. This is up 2% compared to last year and represents 50% of revenue in Q1.\nTaking a closer look at our software revenue, subscription-based revenue represented 81% of total software revenue, up from 77% in the year ago period. Subscription-based revenue includes a ratably recognized as-a-service offerings and our solutions sold as term-based licenses.\nRevenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions as a service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue, totaled 68% of revenue in the quarter. On a regional basis, in Q1, Americas delivered 17% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 59% of total revenue.\nEMEA was flat year-over-year, representing 24% of revenue and APAC delivered 2% growth, accounting for 18% of revenue. The strength in Q1 spanned customer verticals as well. Enterprise customers represented 71% of product bookings in the quarter, service providers represented 15%, and government customers represented 14%, including 4% from U.S. Federal. I will now share our Q1 operating results.\nGAAP gross margin was 80.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83%. Along with our increased component prices, we anticipate continued pressures related to our supply chain in the next several quarters. We expect these pressures will result in some increased costs related to expedite fees and sourcing of long lead time components. GAAP operating expenses were $438 million.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $345 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 16.6%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.7%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.5%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $93.6 million or $1.51 per share.\nNon-GAAP net income was $179 million or $2.89 per share. I will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $90 million in cash flow from operations in Q1. We we tend to see cash flow dip in Q1 as a result of the timing of cash receipts and billings amongst other factors.\nQ1's cash flow is below our recent range because of 2 primary factors. First, we had strong multiyear subscription sales in the quarter. As a reminder, our multiyear subscriptions are generally sold on 3-year terms. We built only 1/3 of the contracted signing with the remainder going to unbilled assets.\nSecond, during the quarter, we also had some significant prepayments with our contract manufacturer associated with the components for future builds. DSO for the quarter remained strong at 55 days.\nCash and investments totaled approximately $936 million at quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $125 million worth of F5 shares or approximately 539,000 shares at an average price of $232. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $11 million.\nDeferred revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $1.576 billion, up from $1.359 billion. The growth in total deferred was largely driven by subscription and SaaS bookings and to a lesser extent, deferred service maintenance.\nFinally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,550 employees up approximately 90 from Q4. This includes employees added with the Threadstack acquisition, which closed in the quarter. Francois shared our Q2 revenue outlook and our updated fiscal year 2022 outlook in his remarks, I'll recap our full Q2 guidance and fiscal year 2022 updates with you now.\nUnless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. Let me start with Q2. We expect Q2 revenue in the range of $610 million to $650 million as a result of supply chain-related systems production constraints.\nTaking into account continued component cost increases, and the costs related to actions we are taking to mitigate supply chain pressures, we expect Q2 gross margins to approximate 82% to 82.5%. As Francois discussed, because we believe the current supply chain challenges are transitory and do not reflect the underlying growth trajectory of the business, we do not intend to adjust our operating model. We believe doing so with risk compromising our ability to deliver future revenue growth.\nAs a result, we are likely to see operating margin pressure in Q2 and for the next several quarters. I'll remind you that, historically, Q2 is our seasonal low for operating margins as a result of the annual payroll tax and retirement benefit resets.\nThat said, we estimate Q2 operating expenses of $357 million to $371 million. We anticipate our full fiscal year effective tax rate will be in the range of 20% to 21%, including the impact of our 19.5% Q1 tax rate with some fluctuations included in the quarter.\nOur Q2 earnings target is $1.75 to $2.15 per share. We expect Q2 share-based compensation expense of approximately $65 million to $67 million. Let me now review our updated fiscal year 2022 outlook. We expect fiscal year 2022 revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 8%, reflecting a reduction of $30 million to $90 million to our prior fiscal year 2022 revenue guidance.\nThe higher end of this range provides for the potential of some additional supplier decommits. It does not, however, assume another step function deterioration from the level of recommit we have seen recently. We continue to be very confident in our software revenue growth range of 35% to 40% and expect to be closer to the top end of the range for the year. We also anticipate global services revenue growth of 1% to 2% for the year. Like other vendors, we have seen component costs and expedite fees escalate over the last year.\nAs a result, in December, we announced we would be implementing a price increase of approximately 8% to our iSeries appliance platform effective February 1. We expect this pricing change will begin to positively impact gross margins in the second half of our fiscal year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 29% to 31% for fiscal '22 with Q2 representing the low point for the year, and operating margins are improving in Q3 and Q4. We remain committed to regaining our target Rule of 40 operating benchmark, where the combination of our revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margins totaled [40].\nwe also remain committed to repurchasing $500 million in shares during the fiscal year. With that, I will turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?\n\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, F5 Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. In closing, I'll note that we are making very good progress with our Volterra and Threat Stack integration, and you will be hearing more about our resulting SaaS-based solution offering very soon. We are made to focus on doing everything in our power to mitigate supply chain impacts for our customers.\nOur future growth and our long-term opportunity will be driven by our software and our imminently launching Software-as-a-Service, app security and delivery solutions. While we are solely disappointed that supply chain challenges have gated our ability to fulfill customer demand for systems in the near term, we are more confident than ever in our position, our strategy and our long-term opportunity.\nOur Q2 pipeline is strong, and we have good visibility into demand for the back half of our fiscal year. Our customers are faced with ever-increasing performance expectations for their applications while at the same time, scaling to meet unprecedented demand and evolving their architectures to enable production scale container-based infrastructures.\nWith our adaptive applications vision and our ability to serve any app anywhere, F5 brings cloud-ready solutions that close the gap between customers' traditional and modern application environments. Finally, I extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire F5 team for their steadfast focus and execution. And thanks to our customers and our partners for being on our journey with us and providing guidance and support along way.\nWith that, operator, we will open the call to Q&A."

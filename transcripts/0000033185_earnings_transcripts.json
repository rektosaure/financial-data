Welcome to the Enerflex Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Fetterly, Vice President, Corporate Development and Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Eric Fetterly\n\nPrincipal and Oilfield Services Analyst, Peters & Co. Limited, Research Division\n\nThank you, Gigi, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Paul Mahoney, Enerflex's President CEO and Preet Dhindsa, our CFO; and Ben Park, Enerflex's Controller. During today's call, our prepared remarks will focus on 4 key areas: one, the continued strong performance of Enerflex' business, two, our outlook going into 2026; three, capital allocation, including an increase in Enerflex's dividend; and four, some initial commentary from Paul and strategic priorities.\nBefore I turn it over to Paul, I'll remind everyone that today's discussion will include no IFRS and other financial measures as well as forward-looking statements regarding Enerflex' expectations for future performance and business prospects. Forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties, and the stated expectations could differ materially from actual results or performance. For more information, refer to the advisory statements within our news release, MD&A and other regulatory filings, all available on our website and under our SEDAR and EDGAR profiles. As our prepared remarks, -- as part of our prepared remarks, we will be referring to slides in our investor presentation, which is available through a link on this webcast and our website under the Investor Relations section.\nI'll now turn it over to Paul.\n\nPaul E. Mahoney\n\nPresident of Production & Automation Technologies, Apergy Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us on this morning's call. I'm pleased to join Enerflex at a very exciting time for the company. The Enerflex team has made significant operational, financial and strategic strides in recent quarters. And I want to start off and thank the team across our global operations for their energy, their commitment and all of their efforts. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial and operating results. The energy infrastructure and aftermarket services business lines continue to be the foundation of our results, contributing 58% of gross margin before depreciation and amortization during the third quarter. The Engineered Systems business line benefited from a favorable project sequencing and strong execution to generate the highest quarterly operating revenue in its history.\nFirst, I'll start with a few strategic and operational highlights. Enerflex's U.S. contract compression business continues to perform well led by increasing natural gas production in the Permian. Utilization remains stable at 94% during Q3 across a fleet size of approximately 470,000 horsepower. Enerflex remains on track to grow its North American contract compression fleet to approximately 485,000 horsepower at the end of 2025. We expect to continue expanding this business in 2026 and we'll provide more specifics early in the new year. In the U.S., Enerflex was awarded a contract to construct a $200 million cubic standard feet per day cryogenic gas processing facility and associated natural gas compression. The project will be executed by the Engineered Systems business line and scheduled for delivery during 2026 with a strategic client partner in the Permian Basin.\nThe company continues to broaden and strengthen relationships within the midstream client partner base in the U.S. which includes strategic alliances and further developing relationships established through the acquisition of Exterran. During Q3, this resulted in Enerflex securing multiple orders for large compression equipment. In Oman, Enerflex successfully completed the construction and start-up of the Block 60 Bisat-C Expansion Facility for its client partner, Okubo exploration and production. The project was delivered ahead of schedule and achieved first crude oil in less than 18 months. Enerflex's investment is supported by a long-term contract and reported as a finance lease.\nIn Argentina, Enerflex delivered a state-of-the-art all electric gas compression station for a long-standing client partner in the Vaca Muerta shale play. Lastly, Enerflex received the prestigious export import Bank of the U.S. Deal of the Year Award for its collaboration on a gas-to-energy project in Guyana. First of its kind in Guyana, Enerflex provided the natural gas conditioning and cryogenic infrastructure for this project. We will generate 300 megawatts of power reduce the country's dependence on imported fuels and expand access to power in underserved communities.\nAnd now a few comments on each of our business lines. Engineered Systems backlog as at September 30 of $1.1 billion provides strong visibility into future revenue generation and business activity levels. Bookings of $339 million during Q3 compared to a trailing 8-quarter average of approximately $320 million. The book-to-bill ratio calculated as bookings divided by revenue and normalized for accounting treatment associated with the Bisat-C Expansion project was 0.9x during Q3 and 1x on a trailing 8-quarter average, highlighting that the company is consistently replenishing its backlog in line with project execution. The outlook for Engineered Systems is supported by healthy bidding activity and backlog visibility that extends into the second half of 2026.\nNotwithstanding, Enerflex continues to closely monitor near-term risks, including tariffs and commodity price volatility and will proactively manage this business line. Activity levels for the ES product line during Q4 of '25 are expected to reflect a pull forward of certain projects into the third quarter. Enerflex continues to expect gross margin for the ES business line in coming quarters to align more closely with historical averages reflective of a shift in project mix. We believe the medium-term outlook for ES products and services is attractive, supported by anticipated growth in natural gas and produced water volumes across Enerflex's global footprint.\nResults for the aftermarket services business line benefited from increased activity levels and customer maintenance activities during the quarter. We expect these trends to continue into 2026. The energy infrastructure business continues to perform well, supported by approximately $1.4 billion of revenue under contract. Our U.S. contract compression fleet is an important part of our energy infrastructure asset base and the fundamentals for this business remain strong. Operational KPIs for this business are highlighted on Slides 15 and 16 of our investor presentation.\nSlides 17 and 18 highlight our international energy infrastructure business, which includes approximately 1.1 million horsepower of operated compression and 24 build, own, operate and maintain or BOOM projects in Bahrain, Oman and Latin America. The international energy infrastructure business has a strong contract position, with a weighted average term of approximately 5 years and is expected to provide a steady foundation to Enerflex's financial performance in the coming years.\nI would like to comment briefly on strategic priorities. Since joining Enerflex at the end of September, I've had the wonderful opportunity to visit the key parts of Enerflex's North American operation and interact across all levels of the company. The strength of Enerflex's people culture and position and as a global leader, have been evident. We expect to provide further insight into strategic priorities including capital allocation in coming months following continued strategic clarity and discussion with our Board of Directors. I would like to emphasize that our go-forward approach will, one, focus on Enerflex's strengths and areas of excellence; two, stay true to the values that have guided the company for decades and three, continue to emphasize discipline, providing meaningful direct shareholder returns and making investments that support long-term shareholder value creation.\nIn the near term, Enerflex' priorities are unchanged and include: one, enhancing the profitability of core operations two, leveraging the company's leading position in core operating countries to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas and produced water volumes; and three, maximizing free cash flow to strengthen Enerflex's financial position, provide direct shareholder returns and invest in selective customer supported growth opportunities.\nBefore I turn it over to Preet, I would like to briefly touch on emerging opportunities we are seeing in the electrical power generation part of our business, including opportunities associated with data centers. The delivery of modularized power generation solutions is a core competency of Enerflex. The Engineered Systems business line has been delivering these types of solutions for over 30 years, and our international energy infrastructure asset base includes upwards of 100,000 horsepower of modularized power generation assets. The micro good power generation market in North America is very much in formation stage. But recent announcements from OEM suppliers and industry participants provide an indication of the potential opportunities. Although power generation represents a modest portion of Enerflex's current Engineered Systems backlog and overall business, we are developing solutions that we believe can address a range of applications and are excited about opportunities in 2026 and beyond.\nFor context, we are currently executing FEED studies for existing and potential client partners and evaluating over 500 megawatts of opportunities across our Engineered Systems and energy infrastructure business lines. We look forward to providing updates as Enerflex continues to develop this market opportunity.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Preet to speak to the financial aside.\n\nPreet S. Dhindsa\n\nInterim President & CEO\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with highlights for the third quarter. We generated revenue of $777 million in the third quarter compared to $601 million in Q3 24 and $615 million in Q2 '25. Higher revenue is primarily attributable to the C expansion project that Paul highlighted, which contributed $116 million in revenue to the Engineered Systems product line, and strong execution of ES projects alongside a high level of operational activity, which led to certain project milestones being achieved earlier than expected. This results in revenue being realized in Q3 that was originally anticipated in later periods.\nGross margin before depreciation and amortization was $206 million or 27% of revenue, including $14 million related to the Visas expansion project compared to $176 million or 29% of revenue in Q3 '24 and $175 million or 29% of revenue during Q2 '25. As Paul referenced, the EI and AMS product lines generated 58% of consolidated gross margin before depreciation and amortization lower compared to 65% during Q3 '24 and our guidance for the full year 2025 as a result of contribution from the Fiset expansion project and strong ES activity. Energy infrastructure performance continued to be strong with gross margin before G&A of $95 million compared to $91 million in Q2 '24 and $86 million in '25.\nAftermarket Services gross margin before G&A was 21% in the quarter, benefiting from strong customer maintenance programs. SG&A was $71 million in the quarter, down $11 million from the prior year period, driven by cost-saving initiatives, improved operational efficiencies and the absence of onetime integration costs incurred in '24 partially offset by higher share-based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $145 million is a new quarterly record for Enerflex that compares to $120 million in Q3 '24 and $130 million during Q2 '25. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from higher gross margin before depreciation and amortization, cost-saving initiatives and operational efficiencies. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital or FFO, increased to $115 million compared to $63 million in Q3 '24 and $89 million in Q2 '25 a function of higher adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow decreased to $43 million in Q3 '25 compared to $78 million during Q3 '24 and PAUSE to working capital investments relating to the execution of projects in the ES business line and higher growth capital spend, offset by -- offset partially by proceeds from the sale of EI assets in Latin America.\nWe saw a build of $41 million in net working capital during the third quarter, principally related to strong revenue recognition during the latter part of the quarter, which temporarily increased accounts receivable, strategic inventory investments to support future projects, including purchase select major components with increasing lead times and continued investment in the best expansion project with $12 million spent during the third quarter. Return on capital employed increased to 16.9% in Q3 '25, a new record for the company compared to 4.5% in Q3 '24 and 16.4% in Q2 '25. Higher ROC is a function of the increase in trailing 12-month EBIT and lower average capital employed, predominantly due to a decline in net debt.\nNet earnings of $37 million or $0.30 per share in Q3 '25 compared to $30 million or $0.24 per share in Q3 '24 and $60 million or $0.49 per share in Q2 '25. Compared to Q3 '24, profitability benefited from higher gross margin, lower SG&A expense and lower finance costs, partially offset by $16 million unrealized loss on redemption options related to senior secured belts.\nNow we'll touch on our strong financial position. Enerflex exited Q3 '25 with a net debt of $584 million, which included $64 million of cash and cash equivalents, a reduction of $108 million compared to Q3 '24 and $24 million compared to the second quarter of 2025. Enerflex bank adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.2x at the end of Q3 '25 down from 1.9x at the end of Q3 '24 and 1.3x at the end of Q2 '25. In early Q3, Enerflex entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with respect to a syndicated secured revolving credit facility. The maturity of the facility has been extended by 3 years to July 2028, and availability is unchanged at $800 million.\nLet me shift to capital allocation. First, on our CapEx plans. We invested $47 million in the business consisting of $33 million in capital expenditures, $15 million for growth and $14 million primarily related to the Visa expansion in the EH region. Enerflex continues to target a disciplined capital program in 2025 with total capital expenditures of approximately $120 million. This includes approximately $60 million for maintenance and property plant and equipment and $60 million allocated to growth opportunities. Disciplined capital spending will focus on customer support opportunities, primarily in the U.S. market.\nAnd now direct shareholder returns. Enerflex returned $11 million to shareholders in Q3 and $35 million during the first 3 quarters of 2025 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The company repurchased 777,000 common shares at an average price of CAD 12.98 per share during Q2 '25 and a total of approximately 2.7 million common shares and average price of CAD 1.93 since its normal course issuer bid commenced on April 1, 2025 to September 30. Under the NCIB, which expires March 31, 2026, the company is authorized to acquire up to a maximum of approximately 6.2 million common shares or approximately 5% of its public float as at the application date for cancellation.\nEnerflex' Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly dividend by 13% to CAD 0.025 per common share, effective with the dividend payable in December 2025. The Board's decision to increase our dividend for a second consecutive year reflects confidence in our business and Enerflex a strong financial position and aligns with our priority to provide meaningful direct shareholder returns. Going forward, capital allocation decisions will be based on delivering value to Enerflex shareholders and measure to get to Enerflex's ability to maintain balance sheet strength. In addition to disciplined growth capital spending, share purchase and dividends Enerflex will also consider further debt reduction to strengthen its balance sheet and lower net finance costs. Unlocking greater financial flexibility positions the company to respond to evolving market conditions and capitalize on opportunities to optimize its step stack.\nI want to thank Enerflex's employees to their efforts to continuing to deliver strong operational and financial results.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for closing remarks.\n\nPaul E. Mahoney\n\nPresident of Production & Automation Technologies, Apergy Corporation\n\nThanks, Preet. Let me reiterate that I'm pleased to join Enerflex at an exciting time for the company and appreciate all the efforts of the Enerflex team and making significant operational, financial and strategic strides. We believe the long-term fundamentals driving our growth, including global energy security, and the continued increase in demand for natural gas remain firmly in place that Enerflex is well positioned for those fundamentals.\nWe will now hand the call back to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to the Enerflex Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Jeff Fetterly, Vice President, Corporate Development and Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Eric Fetterly\n\nPrincipal and Oilfield Services Analyst, Peters & Co. Limited, Research Division\n\nThank you, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Preet Dhindsa, Interim President and CEO; Joe Ladouceur, Interim CFO; and Ben Park, Enerflex's Controller. During today's call, our prepared remarks will focus on 4 key areas: one, the continued strong performance of Enerflex's business; two, our outlook and Enerflex's strategic positioning; three, capital allocation, including our refined capital spending program for 2025 and direct returns to shareholders; and four, our progress on near- and long-term strategic priorities. Before I turn it over to Preet, I'll remind everyone that today's discussion will include non-IFRS and other financial measures as well as forward-looking statements regarding Enerflex's expectations for future performance and business prospects.\nForward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties, and the stated expectations could differ materially from actual results or performance. For more information, refer to the advisory statements within our news release, MD&A and other regulatory filings, all available on our website and under our SEDAR+ and EDGAR profiles. As part of our prepared remarks, we will be referring to slides in our updated investor presentation, which is available through a link on this webcast and on our website under the Investor Relations section. I'll turn it over to Preet.\n\nPreet S. Dhindsa\n\nInterim President & CEO\n\nThanks, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us on this morning's call. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial and operating results that translated into a quarterly record for adjusted EBITDA. These results reflect solid performance across our geographies and business lines as well as our ongoing efforts to optimize and streamline our business. Our Energy Infrastructure and After-Market Services business lines continue to deliver steady performance and reinforce Enerflex's ability to generate sustainable returns across our global platform. Energy Infrastructure and After-Market Services contributed 65% of gross margin before depreciation and amortization in the second quarter of 2025, and we expect these business lines will continue to represent the core of Enerflex's profitability.\nWe also maintained solid visibility in our Engineered Systems business, supported by a healthy $1.2 billion backlog at the end of the second quarter. And now a few highlights from each of our business lines. The Energy Infrastructure business continues to perform well, supported by approximately $1.5 billion of revenue under contract. Our U.S. contract compression fleet is an important part of our Energy Infrastructure asset base and the fundamentals for this business remain strong, led by increasing natural gas production in the U.S. We're also pleased with the operational performance of our U.S. contract compression business, reflective of utilization remaining above 90% for the past 14 quarters and solid revenue per horsepower per month and profitability.\nThese KPIs are highlighted in Slides 18 and 19 of our investor presentation. Demand for new contract compression equipment in the U.S. remains strong. We exited the quarter with 456,000 horsepower and expect to be over 475,000 horsepower by the end of this year. New units are being deployed under multiyear contracts in core operating regions with a focus on larger horsepower natural gas and electric drive applications. Slide 16 and 17 highlight the international Energy Infrastructure business, which includes approximately 1.1 million horsepower of operated compression and 23 Build, Own, Operate and Maintain or BOOM projects in Bahrain, Oman and Latin America. Our 2 produced water projects in Oman continue to perform very well, and we commissioned an expansion of one project in early Q3, which is highlighted on Slide 20.\nOur international Energy Infrastructure business is supported by approximately $1.3 billion of contracted revenue and an average contract term of approximately 5 years. Turning to After-Market Services. This business line benefited from increased activity levels and customer maintenance activities during the quarter. We expect these trends to continue throughout the remainder of 2025. On the Engineered Systems side, we maintained our backlog at $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, consistent with the 8-quarter average ES backlog of approximately $1.2 billion. This sustained level of backlog over a 2-year period reflects stable demand for Enerflex-ES solutions across global energy infrastructure markets.\nEnerflex recorded ES bookings of $365 million during the 3 months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $331 million during the same period of 2024 and the 8-quarter average of $329 million. The ES product line maintained a book-to-bill ratio calculated as bookings divided by revenue of 1.1x during the second quarter of 2025, indicating that new bookings are generally keeping pace with revenue recognition. The current balance between bookings and revenue supports near-term revenue visibility and reflects a stable demand environment. We expect ES revenue to remain steady in the near term and for gross margin from this business to align more closely with historical averages, reflective of a shift in product mix. Demand across the ES product line remains constructive as we continue to actively monitor near-term risks and uncertainties, including the impact of tariffs and commodity price volatility.\nWe believe the medium-term outlook for ES products and services is attractive, supported by anticipated growth in natural gas and produced water volumes across Enerflex's global footprint. Enerflex's priorities in 2025 include enhancing the profitability of core operations, leveraging the company's leading position in core operating countries to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas and produced water volumes and maximizing free cash flow to strengthen Enerflex's financial position, provide direct shareholder returns and invest in selective customer-supported growth opportunities. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I'd like to comment briefly on our leadership transition.\nOn March 19, Enerflex announced that Marc Rossiter stepped down as President, CEO and Director. Concurrently, I assumed the role as Interim President and CEO and Joe as Interim CFO. The Board is undertaking a comprehensive search to identify the company's permanent CEO and has retained a leading global search firm to assist with this process. The search process is making good progress and will not be -- and we will not be commenting further. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to speak to the financial side.\n\nJoe Ladouceur\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Preet, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with highlights from the second quarter. We reported consolidated revenues of $615 million compared to $614 million in Q2 '24 and $552 million in Q1 2025. Gross margin before depreciation and amortization was $175 million or 29% of revenue compared to $173 million or 28% of revenue in Q2 2024 and $161 million or 29% of revenue during Q1 2025. As Preet referenced, the EI and AMS product lines generated 65% of consolidated gross margin before depreciation and amortization during Q2 2025, and we continue to expect similar results for the remainder of the year. Energy Infrastructure performance continued to be strong with gross margin before D&A of $86 million compared to $77 million in Q2 '24 and $86 million in Q1 '25.\nAfter-Market Services gross margin before D&A was 23% in the quarter, benefiting from strong customer maintenance programs. SG&A was $61 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2025, down $14 million from the prior year period. This is driven by cost-saving initiatives, improved operational efficiencies and the absence of onetime integration costs that were incurred in Q2 of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA was $130 million, which represents a new quarterly record for Enerflex. This compares to $122 million in Q2 '24 and $113 million during the first quarter of 2025. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital or FFO increased to $89 million in Q2 2025 compared to $63 million in Q2 '24 and $62 million in the first quarter of 2025.\nThis is a function of higher adjusted EBITDA, lower net finance costs and lower current tax expense. Free cash flow was a use of cash of $39 million in Q2 2025 compared to a use of cash of $4 million during Q2 '24 and a source of cash of $85 million during Q1 2025. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, an increase in FFO was more than offset by an increased growth capital spending and a build in net working capital, notably strategic inventory investments to support future projects, including work in progress related to EI assets and purchases of select major components with increasing lead times, income taxes payable and finally, executive transition costs.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2025, net working capital was also impacted by an increase in accounts receivable, which related to strong revenue recognition during the latter part of the quarter, which we expect to normalize. Now I'd like to touch on our financial position. We exited the quarter with net debt of $608 million, which included $71 million of cash and available liquidity of $630 million compared to $672 million in the first quarter. Enerflex's bank-adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.3x at the end of Q2 '25. That is down from 2.2x at the end of Q2 2024 and consistent with Q1 2025. Further details are included on Slide 13 of our investor presentation. In early Q3, Enerflex entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with respect to its syndicated secured revolving credit facility, the RCF.\nThe maturity date of the RCF has been extended by 3 years to July 11, 2028, and availability is unchanged at $800 million. Now let me shift to capital allocation. First, on our CapEx plans. We invested $71 million in the business, consisting of $34 million in capital expenditures, $23 million of which was for growth and $37 million for expansion of an EI project in our Eastern Hemisphere region that was commissioned in Q3 2025 and is now accounted for as a finance lease. Full year 2025 capital spending is now expected to approximate $120 million compared to our previous guidance of $110 million to $130 million. This includes approximately $60 million earmarked for growth initiatives compared to the previous guidance of $40 million to $60 million.\nGrowth investment will focus on customer-supported opportunities, primarily in the U.S. contract compression business line, where the fundamentals remain strong. Maintenance and PPE capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $60 million compared to our prior guidance of $70 million, and this is reflective of our continued efforts to realize efficiencies across our operations. And now I'll turn to direct shareholder returns. Enerflex returned $18 million to shareholders in Q2 through dividends and share repurchases. Our NCIB commenced on April 1 and authorizes the company to repurchase up to approximately 6.2 million shares through the end of March 2026. Enerflex repurchased 1,899,200 common shares at an average price of CAD 10.08 per share during the second quarter.\nGoing forward, capital allocation decisions will be based on delivering value to Enerflex shareholders and measured against Enerflex's ability to maintain balance sheet strength. In addition to disciplined growth capital spending, share repurchases and dividends, Enerflex will also consider further debt reduction to strengthen its balance sheet and lower net finance costs. Unlocking greater financial flexibility positions the company to respond to evolving market conditions and capitalize on opportunities to optimize its debt stack. I want to thank Enerflex employees for their efforts in delivering strong operational and financial results. We continue to prioritize profitability and operational resilience to ensure Enerflex delivers strong and reliable returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Preet for closing remarks.\n\nPreet S. Dhindsa\n\nInterim President & CEO\n\nThanks, Joe. We made significant operational, financial and strategic strides in recent quarters. I want to thank the Enerflex team across our global operations for their efforts delivering these results. We believe the long-term fundamentals driving our growth, including global energy security and the continued increase in demand for natural gas remain firmly in place. We believe Enerflex is well positioned for those fundamentals, and we are focused on taking advantage of opportunities across our global platform. I look forward to building on our progress. And with that, we will now turn the call to the operator for questions.",

If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star zero on your telephone keypad.\n\nA question, answer session, we'll follow the formal presentation.\n\nBut curious about maybe the offsetting impact in the other pieces or is that 50 basis point kind of annual margin expansion target from your long term framework would still apply and that that sort of scenario as well.\n\nYeah.\n\nFirst off margins incremental margins on all Equifax growth is very attractive there are very high incremental margins, whether it's mortgage or non mortgage now really across equifax. So when you think about you know our business our business growing in the 5% to 10% range, there's a lot of operating leverage there.\n\nI'd remind you second is that we didn't really put this into our model, but we have the ability to tighten our belt cost wise.\n\nDependent upon what kind of economic event is there, but that's something that we would certainly be thoughtful about we typically in other economic events like during the Covid pandemic, we kept investing because of the.\n\nOur view of the future in the high incremental margins. We have so we would expect to you know.\n\nGrow our income and grow our margins in a in an economic event, where we're growing 5% to 10% you know that that has very high incremental margins and so it's going to result in.\n\nOur ability to continue to grow the both the top and bottom line.\n\nJust as a reminder, if you model it yourself right, 7% to 10% is our long term growth framework organic and it's that growth rate in which we we indicated we could grow 50 basis points. So if however, your modeling recession, you're below that while that's probably that would impact margin growth.\n\nThen also as Mark said, our margins are very strong in mortgage and non mortgage but as we've talked about in the past non mortgage margins are higher than mortgage margins right so be it.\n\nPrincipally because of the pass through payments to our partner right. So they get them to our vendor. So the so that our margins are lower than mortgage they are still very healthy, but they're not as high as they are in non mortgage.\n\nVery helpful. Thank you and then switched.\n\nSwitching gears, a little bit for my follow up and maybe a hard question to answer, but I'm going to ask it anyway.\n\nAnd a choppy or macro.\n\nWith the work number does that competitively get prioritized relative to manual options or maybe do it yourself verifications from like a direct to consumer lens just based on how quickly conditions are changing or.\n\nI just wanted to see like from like a relative performance perspective.\n\nThat to do better.\n\nWe think there's a positive trend for the income and employment data in every economic event.\n\nIf you look at like card, it's used in some places, but most don't in an economic event understanding someone's credit score and if they're working allows that card originator to originate more cards, because they have more confidence that consumers' ability to pay so in.\n\nAn economic event I would say broadly more data is going to be used in one of the most powerful data assets. We have is if someone's working I would also add to it you know our alternative data whether it's a.\n\nN C plus data ex pellet track and our new one score solution that really drives a lift you know in our office straight credit file. That's another example of data that's going to be very valuable in an economic event. So you know as we move post cloud as we now have all our data in a single data fabric and as we have the ability.\n\nTo really effectively combined data elements using our E. FX AI to really drive higher performing solutions those become more valuable in every economic event, but as you point out.\n\nDownturn it allows our customers to better identify those consumers that can handle the loan typically that they're trying to give to that consumer so.\n\nI think we're well positioned to go into an economic event with our differentiated data assets. The fact that we're substantially cloud complete and as you know now we're ramping our product and innovation focused because we have the bandwidth to do it with cloud behind us. So we're able to bring those solutions together and I think that the one with.\n\nWe talked about during the call earlier. This earlier is the twin indicator on mortgage which is something I wanted to do since I joined Equifax. We now have in market. Its something we couldn't do before and only equifax can do it and we're going to do the same thing in auto where income is verified on lots of auto loans and the same thing in P loans. So we.\n\nWe're well positioned with our differentiated data assets to bring you know.\n\nMore value to our customers around decisioning.\n\nIn any economic event, including a downturn.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you. Your next question today is coming from Jason Haas from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nHey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question actually I wanted to follow up on that twin indicator that you. Just mentioned I was curious if you could talk about what the reception has been like.\n\nHow long does it take mortgage lenders.\n\nTo start to utilize that should we think about it you know it takes several quarters to make that switch or what's the timeframe and then yeah. It's early days yes.\n\nYes. It is early days, we bet, we've only been in market for you know I don't know 60 days. The reception is Super positive I was one of our with one of our partners last night and you know, they're helping us bring that to market Super energized about it feedback from the mortgage space is very very positive.\n\nAround that shopping.\n\nA window with a consumer which up until today. The only visibility that are a mortgage originator would have or a mortgage broker would have in that window. As you know what their credit score is we're able now to add an indicator that says they're working we can add and indicators that says here's their employer, we have an indicator that he was there last week.\n\n12 months income not their current income, but you know what there.\n\nWhat their average income was it just gives them confidence on which consumer to work on which consumers. They can move to an application in which consumers. They have confidence that can close and remember mortgage originators spending five grand from the start of that shopping process.\n\nThrough to a closed loan so if they can optimize that and close more loans. It makes our our credit file with the Queen indicators Super valuable. So we're really energized around that differentiation. We can now bring to market in mortgage and as I said, we're going to do the same thing in other verticals like auto and card.\n\nSorry, auto and a P loans, where these are big ticket transactions, where income and employment you know provides.\n\nProvides real visibility around someone's a capacity to repay along with their propensity to repay from their credit score.\n\nIs there any risk or you're seeing any evidence I know, it's early days that theres been any cannibalization of .\n\nYeah, It's obviously something we're super thoughtful about no because you know the indicators were using provide we believe enough value to enhance their shopping process, but still.\n\nYou know that the lender is still required to do a current income validation.\n\nFor a mortgage that's well defined and in auto is typically defined by the lender and then the securitization market and same with P. Loans. So we're obviously trying to balance how much information you've given that shopping process to make sure it's enough to benefit that marketing our shopping window.\n\nBut then as you point out protect our full twin pulls later on so it's something we'll continue to watch where we think we have the right balance.\n\nAnd the other thing we expect it will actually promote in some regards.\n\nIs the use of twin as you know we don't have full penetration of twin in any of those verticals. There's still a handful of mortgage originators that are fully manual so by having the twin indicator on the shopping file. It helps them know that we have a income and employment report for that consumer.\n\nAnd as you know, we don't have full penetration yet it's going to take a long time to get to the full population, but it also provide that visibility. So there's a lot of benefits that are we're energized about and we're still in the early days as you point out to us.\n\nAs far as rolling it out in penetration in which we can accelerate as we go through second quarter and through the balance of the year and then of course, we'll add those other verticals are later in the year.\n\nThat's great and if I could ask a follow up on the UWS margin outlook, it's good to see.\n\nThe margin came in better than .\n\nSo still down year over year and it looks like the guidance now implies that the year over year declines will worsen through the year. So I was curious if you could talk about the puts and takes there and what's driving.\n\nThe margin decline.\n\nWhy could potentially worse year over year as we go through the year.\n\nYeah again, AWS margins, we think are going to be above 50% right and they are actually strengthening sequentially.\n\nWe have said consistently that we expect dws margins to run in the range, we're talking about and we continue to believe that's the case right. So we feel very good about about the level of AWS margins, obviously, they're being impacted by the fact that the mortgage market is down right. So that's impacting their revenue growth and they have very high variable.\n\nSo that with obviously, a more normalized mortgage market their margins would certainly be higher but given the level of the mortgage market, we're very happy with the way their margins are trending.\n\nThank you. Your next question today is coming from Joshua General line from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nHi, Good morning, it's Mohit on for Josh.\n\nTo touch base on the question earlier about these smaller there that was acquired I guess, how do you think about that when it comes to the M&A synergies.\n\nFocus more on growing twin records organically through partnerships or do you see a pathway to grow with that.\n\nIt would be in the M&A game or.\n\nOn a broader note how do you view the M&A pipeline currently given your free cash flow growth.\n\nNext year.\n\nYeah. So as I said in my comments I've been saying for five plus years, a bolt on M&A as integral to our strategy. We have in our long term framework to grow a eight to 12 with one to two points of that eight to 12 from a bolt on M&A over kind of a long long long term, but kind of on an annual basis.\n\n.\n\nSo that's integral to our strategy we use the bolt on term deliberately we're not looking for large acquisitions or transformational acquisitions, that's not a part of our strategy. We want to strengthen the core of Equifax, We've got really four strategic priorities around bolt on M&A and workforce solutions is one of those strengthening workforce solutions around capabilities.\n\nAnd records.\n\nSecond is differentiated data, which really checks the same box.\n\nIndian fraud, like our count mitigate or acquisitions, and then international platforms like Boa Vista.\n\nWith regards to work force solutions in the last five years, we've probably done.\n\nEight acquisitions to strengthen workforce, including businesses that brought new capabilities around our I nine and other employer solutions that also give us access to employers and records. So really a real clear strategy there with regards to the checker acquisition.\n\nWe didn't look at that we didn't see it as being.\n\nA capability that would strengthen the core of equifax. So it was not in our our gun sites that we know the company.\n\nNo the leader of it but it was not something that would fit our strategy for M&A, but to be crystal clear bolt on M&A as I said in my capital allocation discussion you know is clearly one of our priorities going forward and we think we have a ample.\n\nAmple.\n\nAnd growing free cash flow and leverage capacity going forward to keep investing in capex at very high levels and very high returns principally around our new products.\n\nTo do bolt on M&A inside of that one to two points a year of Rev growth framework and then now we're super energized to have our capital allocation plan to return cash to shareholders through the dividend and the buyback program.\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Ashish from RBC capital markets. Your line is now live.\n\nHi, Good morning. This is David page on for Ashish I, just had a clarifying question on the.\n\nSSA agreement I think you mentioned, an additional $50 million.\n\nAnnual revenue is that.\n\nIs that just 50 or is that.\n\nTotal of $100 million.\n\nNo. It's it's it's it's a it's around 50 and it's part of a contract extension that we did over a year ago, but you know for US. It was important to see SSA, what I would call. While it is still in transition in this new administration C.\n\nSee the value of twin and move forward to get that program online and operating which it was a couple of weeks ago, and we expect that to grow so that was a positive for us and Oh, we don't roll into our revenue you know in our second third and fourth quarter and then continue in the future. We expect it to be a long term program for .\n\nEquifax, given the value we deliver around those disability income benefits.\n\nVerifications and invalidation of Redetermination.\n\nGreat. Thanks, very much appreciate it.\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin Mcveigh from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nGreat. Thanks, so much hey, just.\n\nGiven the uncertainty.\n\nReally terrific to see the results, but what gives you the confidence to initiate our capital return, which obviously is a terrific outcome, but was there any particular trigger that said now is the quarter to do it because again, it's a terrific outcome, but just what gave you the company should do it this quarter or is it particularly given that the macro uncertainty.\n\nYes.\n\nYou know Kevin this is something that we've had in our plans for a long time I don't know if it's true, but I suspect. It is I've, probably John and I have talked about it in every earnings call for the last three or four years that we're moving to it and I think the big milestone for US obviously was completing the cloud now we're not fully complete but we're north of 85.\n\n5%, we've got some small markets outside the U S. Complete you know that was a big deal for us to get that behind US as you have that brings our capex down.\n\nWe invested significant excess free cash flow over the last number of years. We've also had.\n\nSay a number of quarters.\n\nUnder our belt to see how Equifax is operating post cloud if I want to use that term U S. I S. UWS.\n\nOur ability to innovate our ability to rollout new products. So this was a matter of.\n\nNot if but when you know what.\n\nWe were prepared to do it we thought about doing it in the first quarter you felt that was probably a good time to do it but we decided to defer it to today and you know our board was Super supportive and you know as you can tell from our .\n\nAnalysis of how we think about how we'll perform in a potential recession.\n\nA lot of confidence in our ability to grow and generate free cash flow through that period.\n\nWhen our businesses are performing.\n\nReally well you know first quarter I think is another proof point kind of broadly the beat that we had and then you look at the performance of U S. I S. International AWS you look at the government potential you know, we think we can rather whether an economic event.\n\nYou know deliver consistently that dividend and dividend growth, while still investing in equifax and then have a substantial excess free cash flow that we would expect to grow that we will have returned to shareholders through our buyback program is.\n\nIt's now two and a half times, yes that was a goal. So now you have to.\n\nOur balance sheet, where we said and capital this quarter was at a run rate, which is at the levels that we've talked about getting it down to this year right. So substantial reduction in capital that we delivered in the first quarter. So those things actually strengthen your comfort with free cash flow going forward.\n\nGot it terrific outcome and then just if I can real quick is there any way to think about how much some of the pricing dynamics.\n\nWas that already in the guidance or was that maybe an incremental benefit that obviously I think it was really smart to kind of reaffirm but the pricing dynamics with it was already in the 25 guidance or are you talking about are you talking about from our our partner, where we pass through the price and mortgage yes, yes, yes, Oh, yes that was in our guide.\n\nIn February that's locked in it doesn't change obviously the number of transactions changes, but I know that pricing was in there and broadly at Equifax, we do our pricing principally on one one so that was all in our February guide and there's no change there and we have a lot of visibility on that there is some.\n\nYou know obviously, there's some government contracts that we have that have a pricing escalators that happened during the year not on one one because they're multi year contracts and then when we get a new contract obviously, that's new revenue.\n\nAnd I think I talked about in the recession conversation are increasing.\n\nThe percentage of our revenue that is subscription based is also a positive going forward.\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Telsey shoe from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\n\nHi, Good morning, Thanks for taking my question I found a recession scenario analysis Super helpful. And I was wondering if you can talk through your expectations for growth outlook for each of these components Andreas vaccination scenario.\n\nI'm sorry finished the back half of your question.\n\nI was wondering how you expect each of these components to grow under a stagflation environment.\n\nCore hours and no way pets, yeah, we didn't do that analysis.\n\nIt's one that we can certainly work on you know.\n\nWe we we take we picked a typical recession.\n\nNo I think it would be a different analysis and one that we haven't done around a stagflation environment, we need high inflation low.\n\nLow growth and I guess your assumption would be higher interest rates theres probably.\n\nDozens of recession scenarios, you could put together, we opted to for us and for you to share what we would characterize as a typical recession, but to be fair I think it's your point there is no typical recession, but I think that's our best view of how we would perform and what we would characterize as a typical recession.\n\nGot it and then my second question is on the copper line protocol. So last quarter, you talked about the funding practice changes at the U.\n\nI was wondering you know what level of impact from those two contracts.\n\nHow much of the low double digit growth in government and.\n\n10% growth in the second half is really driven by the ethane contracts.\n\nYeah, so on the on that.\n\nYou're referring to the CMS and USDA changes the prior administration put in place to have a.\n\nIn essence, a cost sharing with the states to use that data as it used to be 100% reimbursed first I would say that there's a.\n\nWe are hopeful that the current administration is going to go back to where it used to be meaning to government federal government reimbursed the states for utilization of this data in order to promote the use of verified data for social service delivery to cut down on that 160 billion of improper payments. So that's obviously one strategy that we have.\n\nGoing forward, we put in our guide for the year, what we expect the impact to that would be on existing contracts. So I think that was already in our guide.\n\nWe also put in our guide for the year for AWS Equifax, new relationships, we expect to get you know an add to that the SSA you know startup that we talked about earlier.\n\nBiggest impact that we have going forward. If you look at 'twenty five 'twenty six 'twenty 728, it was gonna be state penetration those states that are still fully manual or arent using our solution getting them to use it which we expect to continue to be a positive for us and then as I said, there's just a different.\n\nIt's a different macro in Washington, you know, there's a real focus now, which I would say you know maybe in the last administration wasn't as strong.\n\nAround the improper payments Thats, a huge number when theres a big focus on.\n\nThose kind of activities, which we think is a positive for us I'm not sure it's going to move the needle in 'twenty five but you know over the long term think 'twenty six 'twenty seven under this administration, they're clearly focused on tackling.\n\nThat 260 billion of improper payments.\n\nWe are a great solution to help do that and so we're spending a bunch of more time in Washington to help.\n\nThe different agencies understand how are our solution can be used to help.\n\nAddress the improper payments and then also as I said, we're adding more resources at the stage to drive state penetration.\n\nAnd I know you know, but it's we announced it was a $50 million contract or about $50 million contract. It's in the context of an $800 million business. So obviously, we're seeing nice growth in other areas.\n\nGot it thanks.\n\nThank you. Your next question today is coming from Simon from Redburn. Your line is now live.\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nJust start with a bit of a housekeeping one please.\n\nIn terms of the AWS to verify mortgage revenue growth in the talent growth could you.\n\nGive us the figures for the revenue outgrowth for both segments this quarter versus underlying volumes and then how to think about how you're what you're implying for in your guidance for that revenue out through the year.\n\nYeah. So.\n\nWhat we're talking about now going forward, we've talked about this a little bit when we did our fourth quarter results. In February is going forward, we're going to give a view on revenue for mortgage out of AWS, but we're not going to give all the components right. So I think what we'd said last year as we expect it to continue to outperform the underlying markets nicely. As we went forward. We said you know what.\n\nLow single digit to low double digit low double I'm, sorry high single digit to low double digit, but and in terms of kind of go forward guidance and reporting that's not a statistic we're going to share anymore.\n\nOkay Yeah.\n\nAre you for asking the question.\n\nMaybe I could turn onto something a slightly longer term I was just wondering if you could give us an update please around the international Records you have building and in AWS and when we know how to think about your strategy for that business longer term monetization of those records.\n\nAnd sort of when that might be something we start to talk about it more prominently.\n\nYeah. It's it's a it's clearly are investing you know really in three principal markets in our fourth the Australia, Canada and the U K and then also in India, We're making positive traction in all those markets were in market with products in all three of those markets that look like the AWS.\n\nand we don't have the same penetration yet in those markets. So we're continuing to focus on growing records to your question around when is it going to move the needle in Equifax, it's gonna be quite some time, but you would expect us to and we are investing in that to grow in markets that I outlined to you know have the twin.\n\nThe solution or the AWS solution in those markets.\n\nOkay. That's great. Thank you very much.\n\nThank you. Your next question today is coming from Scott from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question just wanted to go to the outlook on employer in U S. Hiring I think I know you know last quarter, you guys were guiding to hiring being down 8% for the year has that changed at all.\n\nWe did not change our guidance for the full year for for hiring.\n\nGot it got it that's helpful. And then just going back to the the inquiries outlook as well.\n\nIn the context of the outperformance that you had in the first quarter and you know keeping the guidance for 2025 inquiries pretty steady I mean was it you know kind of taking a more conservative approach to , the whole year or more so in the second half relative to I think that John pointed out in his comments that we set the guide.\n\nYou know from minus 13 in the first quarter and minus 12 for the year in U S. I S inquiries back in February.\n\nWhen we got into late February and March there was a downtick in the 10 year and a downtick in mortgage rates and we saw some increased activity likely refi that.\n\nPart of our stronger performance in the first quarter most of it was non mortgage but that mortgage activity as well as you know a better execution for us and some of the pre qual products that we're selling into the marketplace. But then as we got a really into late March and into April. The last couple of weeks 10 years come up again with somebody.\n\nActivities in Washington around tariffs and the broader concerns around the economy and we've seen activity tailed down. So we really used over the last seven to 14 days, which is fairly typical for us.\n\nAs our kind of guide for the rest of the year, which is why we went back to the minus 12, and that's kind of what we're seeing over the last couple of weeks.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Matt O'neill from Ft Partners. Your line is ally.\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question most have been asked and answered here I guess quickly just following up on the employer service question just now.\n\nAny indication I guess that in the important sort of white collar hiring environment. There has been more of a sit on our hands approach from large employers in the last couple of weeks here.\n\nAnd I guess, just as a follow up around now having the share repurchase at your disposal any thoughts on how to balance being aggressive there versus the tuck in acquisitions or just continue to be opportunistic. Thank you.\n\nThe first one I think you said employer services I think you meant talent as far as the hiring and we haven't seen a real change in the last couple of weeks, although we're certainly watching it with regards to the capital allocation plan you know it is going to be balanced.\n\nYou know Capex is something that is a real priority for us obviously at lower levels, but still quite substantial because of the high returns that generates organically inside of equifax from principally new products. So that's going to be a stead.\n\nSteady and we think very positive shareholder return focus to .\n\nInside of Equifax bolt on M&A, we're gonna be disciplined about.\n\nBoth the areas that we look in as well as the financial returns. We're looking for businesses that are accretive to our growth rate and accretive to our margins. After integration that's a high bar, but as you know we've been pretty effective over the last five plus years.\n\nCompleting something like 20 acquisitions again bolt on acquisitions like adverse insights the incarceration data that's been it.\n\nGreat addition to workforce solutions counting mitigate or in a you know some of the other.\n\nBolt ons and tuck ins, we've done in workforce as well as in the U S. I S and of course Boa Vista that we acquired are you know almost 18 months ago that has been is doing really well, we're really pleased with the Boa Vista acquisition. So bolt on M&A, we'll continue.\n\nAnd then obviously the dividend when you make a commitment on a dividend.\n\nTo grow it in line with earnings and you know in that 5% to 15% range, it's something that becomes an important commitment from the company. So we view that as something that.\n\nConsistent over the long term way to return cash to our shareholders and then the 3 billion dollar a four year buyback program, we announced on that is aligned with our ability we believe to generate growth in earnings and free cash flow over the next four plus years and our long term framework are in.\n\nWe will be consistently.\n\nConsistently in the market during the open trading windows.\n\nWe'll.\n\nLook for opportunistic purchases.\n\nWhen theres market dislocations, or we don't see M&A that makes sense for equifax.\n\nAnd if we have excess free cash flow because we're not doing M&A, we're going to return that to shareholders and that's all while maintaining our strong investment grade balance sheet.\n\nSo we are positioned for any economic event.\n\nI appreciate the rundown and yes, I meant talent. Thank you.\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Ultra cruise left from Citi. Your line is now live.\n\nGood afternoon everybody.\n\nA couple of questions from me if I may.\n\nSo that's one place.\n\nIf you think about what you did in your U S national mortgage business clearly it's accelerated meaningfully.\n\nMeaningfully.\n\nIn the first quarter of the year from what it was in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nAnd in particular within the B to B non mortgage.\n\nHow much of that acceleration related to better market conditions.\n\nOn lending in particular and how much relates to.\n\nWhat you've done in terms of you know.\n\nGetting back to market following your cloud transformation.\n\nQuestion on a similar vein around the cloud.\n\nAre you able to just confirm that first course are fully benefited from the cloud transformation and U S. I S.\n\nAre you able to say year over year how much.\n\nThe cloud transformation benefits at the cost side.\n\nIn that division. Please thank you.\n\nYeah. So there's no question that we've seen a real change in U S. I S momentum in the marketplace post cloud and we attribute the .\n\nVast majority first off there's no change in the market from fourth quarter to first quarter. There is no change in the market. So it's really our ability to execute and be in the marketplace. We've talked for years about what we knew was a challenge for all our businesses and most recently U S. I S too.\n\nBuild the cloud to migrate our customers and grow the business and that dampened our ability to be commercially present, if you will with our customers because the customer meetings got absorbed with migration discussions that change last summer and so we've seen real momentum.\n\nMomentum by all of the verticals in the U S. I S and their ability to just engage with our customers around our new products, our new solutions second and we talked about it in our prepared comments, we've seen a an acceleration in their focus on innovation, which we expect it. So these are all things we expected to happen we've talked to.\n\nFor a couple of years about our expectation that we'd also see share gains from.\n\nFrom a U S I S.\n\nBecause of our cloud native capabilities around being always on.\n\nOur latency or speed of data transmission, we're hearing very positive feedback from our customers around what it's like to interact with Equifax now that we're cloud native so that's a real positive so I would definitely attribute.\n\nThe outperformance, which you know frankly surprised us obviously that wasn't our framework that we had in February.\n\nTo this business are really operating in a post cloud mode, where the entire team now can really focus on customers focused on innovation focus on new products and focus on growth.\n\nWe would expect that to continue going forward and kind of the last pieces, you're starting it was probably very minimal in the first quarter, but you're starting to see the benefits that are coming from that multi data solutions like the mortgage twin indicator that we have in the U S. I S credit file that's going to show up in share gains.\n\nFor U S I S in in mortgage.\n\nBecause of the additional data that we'll have the gift that will differentiate us from our competitors on net mortgage shopping credit file.\n\nAnd to your question on cost yet in terms of the migration of the consumer databases to the cloud, yes that was completed.\n\nThe current run costs are fully on the cloud and the prior infrastructures decommission youre seeing it in the margins, we're not going to quantify the dollar amount, but youre seeing it in the margin growth and the very nice margin performance up almost 150 basis points in the first quarter year to year and then obviously in almost 200 basis points in the second quarter.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nHi, Thanks, good morning.\n\nYou talked about the performance of cards P loans and auto volumes in one queue can you talk about how it trends in each of these categories performed exiting the quarter and in the first three weeks of April.\n\nI think we already commented I dunno, if you were on the calls for that period George but.\n\nWe haven't seen any change in the last couple of weeks and we don't expect them to change you know in the second quarter for sure from what we saw in the first quarter and you know this first a number of weeks in April.\n\nOkay got it thanks for clarifying that and then in your long term growth framework that you provided are you assuming a return of mortgage volumes to historical levels pre COVID-19.\n\nOkay.\n\nNo our long term growth framework, which I think you know assumes a normal economy.\n\nSo think about in that eight to 12, you know and this is long term right. So it's through cycles and call. This recession.\n\nHigher interest rates and the impact on our on.\n\nOn mortgage as being kind of an economic event, but no over the over the long term, we expect euro eight to 12 or seven to 10 organic and there's a couple of points call. It 200 basis points of GDP.\n\nGDP in that long term growth model. So you know when you think about where the mortgage market is today.\n\n50% below what we would characterize as normal.\n\nAnd you think about that returning to normal you know that's going to drive that eight to 12.\n\nYou know for sure because you know.\n\nThat's not how we expect mortgage to grow over the long term.\n\nOther big macro in mortgage is the impact of the pricing pass through we have from our partner.\n\nThe long term.\n\nWe don't know what theyre going to do on pricing next year or the year. After the year after that but as you know it's been quite substantial the last couple of years. So that's another element that.\n\nIt will have an impact on our long term framework.\n\nThank you we reached end of our question and answer session I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor for any further or closing comments.\n\nI just wanted to say thank you everybody for joining the call.\n\nIf you have any follow up questions reach out to all their myself. Thank you.\n\nThank you that does conclude today's teleconference and webcast you may disconnect. Your lines at this time and have a wonderful day, we thank you for your participation today.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah.",

Welcome to the Enerflex Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Jeff Fetterly, Vice President, Corporate Development and Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Eric Fetterly\n\nPrincipal and Oilfield Services Analyst, Peters & Co. Limited, Research Division\n\nThank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Marc Rossiter, President and CEO; and Preet Dhindsa, SVP and CFO. During today's call, our prepared remarks will focus on 3 key areas: one, the continued strong operational performance of the business and our outlook for 2025; two, capital allocation, including capital spending and direct shareholder returns; and three, our progress on near- and long-term strategic priorities.\nBefore I turn it over to Marc, I'll remind everyone that today's discussion will include non-IFRS and other financial measures as well as forward-looking statements regarding Enerflex's expectations for future performance and business prospects. Forward-looking information involve risks and uncertainties and the stated expectations could differ materially from actual results or performance. For more information, refer to the advisory statements within our news release, MD&A and other regulatory filings, all available on our website and under the SEDAR+ and EDGAR profiles. As part of our prepared remarks, we will be referring to slides in our updated investor presentation, which is available through a link on this webcast and on our website under the Investor Relations section.\nI'll turn it over to Marc Rossiter.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us on this morning's call. We delivered a strong finish to the year with solid operating results across Enerflex's geographies and product lines. Our Energy Infrastructure and After-market Services business lines continue to provide steady, reliable performance and revenue streams, reinforcing Enerflex's ability to deliver sustainable returns across our global platform. Energy Infrastructure and After-market Services generated 69% of our gross margin before depreciation and amortization in 2024 and we expect these business lines will continue to represent the core of Enerflex's profitability in 2025. Our strong operational performance and focus on maximizing free cash flow has resulted in a rapid deleveraging of our balance sheet. We reached the low end of our target leverage range, closing 2024 at 1.5x compared to 2.3x at the end of Q4 2023 and we expect to make further progress in 2025. Our business remains strong, supported by roughly $1.5 billion in contract backlog for our EI assets and a $1.3 billion backlog for our ES business line.\nBefore reviewing our operational performance and business outlook, I would like to comment briefly on the geopolitical tensions across North America. We continue to closely monitor the situation, including the potential application of tariffs. Based on currently available information, the direct impact of tariffs on Enerflex's business is expected to be mitigated by the company's diversified operations and proactive risk management. Enerflex's operations in the United States, Canada and Mexico are largely distinct in the customers and projects they serve with negligible cross-border traffic for finished goods. The company has been working to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs. The United States is Enerflex's largest operating region, generating 45% of consolidated revenue in 2024 by destination of sale and we believe the company is well positioned to benefit from growth in domestic energy production.\nEnerflex's operations in Canada and Mexico generated 10% and 3% of consolidated revenue in 2024, respectively. And now a few highlights for each of our business lines. The Energy Infrastructure business continues to perform well across our 3 core regions: the United States, Latin America and the Middle East. In the United States, the fundamentals for contract compression remain strong, led by the expected increases in natural gas production, notably in the Permian Basin. We are pleased with the operational performance of our U.S. contract compression business, reflected in the utilization in the mid-90% range for both the quarter and full year 2024 and revenue per horsepower per month and profitability showing continued momentum.\nSlides 18 and 19 of our investor presentation highlight our fleet composition and the strong relative operating performance of the business. Demand for new contract compression equipment in the United States remains strong, and we expect our contract compression fleet will grow from 428,000 horsepower at the end of 2024 to over 475,000 horsepower this year. New units are being deployed under multiyear contracts in core operating regions with a focus on larger horsepower, natural gas and electric drive applications.\nSlide 16 and 17 highlight our international energy infrastructure business, which includes approximately 1.2 million horsepower of operated compression and 26 build, own, operate and maintain or what we call BOOM projects in the Middle East and Latin America. Our 2 produced water projects in Oman continue to perform very well and we are in the process of expanding one of the sites, which we highlight on Slide 20. Our international Energy Infrastructure business is supported by approximately $1.4 billion of contracted revenue and an average contract term that exceeds 5 years.\nTurning to After-market Services. This business line benefited from strong activity levels and customer maintenance activities. We are especially pleased with the performance of our AMS business in countries where Enerflex also operates EI assets, reflective of a differentiated solution and our strong competitive position in core countries. On the Engineered Systems side, we recorded bookings of $301 million, inclusive of a $75 million derecognition with no associated gross margin of future revenue related to the termination of the cryogenic natural gas processing facility project contract in Kurdistan. The majority of bookings during the quarter originated in the North American segment and relate to gas compression solutions.\nTotal Engineered Systems backlog held steady at $1.3 billion and we expect the majority of this backlog to be converted to revenue over the next 12 months. We are very happy with the continued strong project execution in our ES business, with margins during Q4 of 2024 also benefiting from a favorable product mix. However, during 2025, ES gross margin before depreciation and amortization is expected to be more consistent with historical long-term average for this business line, reflective of the weakness in domestic natural gas prices during much of 2024 and a shift of project mix in Enerflex's ES backlog. Notwithstanding, near-term revenue for this business line is expected to remain steady. Enerflex is encouraged by initial customer response to improved domestic natural gas prices and the medium-term outlook for ES products and services continues to be attractive, driven by expected increases in natural gas and produced water volumes across Enerflex's global footprint.\nBefore I turn the call over to Preet, I want to review Enerflex's priorities for 2025. These include: #1, enhancing the profitability of core operations; #2, leveraging the company's leading position in core operations to capitalize on expected increases in natural gas and produced water volumes; and three, maximizing free cash flow to strengthen our financial position, provide optionality for direct shareholder returns and invest in selective customer-supported growth opportunities.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Preet to speak to the financial side of the business.\n\nPreet Dhindsa\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. Enerflex delivered fourth quarter results that exceeded the ranges included in our 2024 guidance. We're particularly pleased with our ongoing progress in efficiently managing working capital, lowering net finance costs and optimizing the company's debt stack. I'll start with highlights for our fourth quarter. We reported consolidated revenue of $561 million compared to $574 million in Q4 '23 and $601 million in Q3 '24. Gross margin before depreciation and amortization was $174 million or 31% of revenue compared to $158 million or 28% of revenue in Q4 '23 and $176 million or 29% of revenue during Q3 '24. Adjusted EBITDA was $121 million compared to $91 million in Q4 '23 and $120 million during Q3 '24. Energy Infrastructure performance continued to be strong with gross margin before D&A of $86 million compared to $87 million in Q4 '23 and $91 million in Q3 '24. After-market Services gross margin before D&A was 22% in the quarter, benefiting from strong customer maintenance programs.\nEnerflex's SG&A of $92 million was $18 million higher year-over-year and up $10 million on a sequential basis, mainly due to increased share-based compensation and a bad debt recovery of $9 million in the comparative 2023 period. Cash provided by operating activities was $113 million in Q4 '24, which included working capital recovery of $39 million. We are pleased with our ongoing global efforts to efficiently manage working capital. Free cash flow was $76 million compared to $139 million during Q4 '23, which included a working capital recovery of $112 million and $78 million in Q3 '24.\nStarting with the fourth quarter, Enerflex modified its calculation of free cash flow, which is now defined as cash provided by operating activities, less total capital expenditures, growth and maintenance, mandatory debt repayments and lease payments, while proceeds of asset dispositions are added back. Details of this calculation are included in our press release and MD&A. Now I'll touch on our balance sheet and further deleveraging. We exited the quarter with net debt of $616 million, which included $92 million of cash and available liquidity of $614 million compared to $588 million in Q3.\nDuring the quarter, Enerflex redeemed $62.5 million of its 9% notes due October 2027. The redemption was completed at a price of 103% and we expect the ongoing interest savings associated with the notes redeemed will materially exceed the redemption premium paid. As a result of our continued focus on financial discipline and operational execution, we repaid $359 million of debt since the beginning of 2023 and reached the low end of our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2x. Further details are included on Slide 22 of our investor presentation.\nLet me shift to capital allocation. First, our CapEx plans. We invested $47 million in the business during the quarter, consisting of $32 million in capital expenditures, primarily for maintenance and $15 million for expansion of an EI project in the Eastern Hemisphere that will be accounted for as a finance lease. Enerflex is targeting a disciplined capital program in 2025 with total capital expenditures of $110 million to $130 million. This includes $40 million to $60 million for growth capital expenditures. Similar to 2024, disciplined capital spending will focus on customer supported opportunities, the majority of our growth focused on expanding our U.S. contract compression fleet. As Marc mentioned, we expect to grow our fleet by over 10% in 2025 with new units deployed under multiyear contracts in core operating regions.\nAnd now direct shareholder returns. Enerflex returned $2 million to shareholders through dividends in Q4 and this number will increase starting in Q1 2025 with the previously announced 50% bump to our dividend. This increase coincided with Enerflex's leverage ratio falling within the company's bank adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 to 2x. Going forward, capital allocation decisions will be based on delivering value to Enerflex shareholders and measured against Enerflex's ability to maintain balance sheet strength. In addition to increases to the company's dividend, share repurchases and disciplined growth capital spending, Enerflex will also consider reducing leverage below its target range to further improve balance sheet strength and lower net finance costs.\nUnlocking greater flexibility positions the company to capitalize on opportunities to optimize its debt stack and respond to evolving market conditions. I want to thank Enerflex employees for their efforts in delivering continued strong operational and financial results. Our focus remains on generating sustainable free cash flow, further improving balance sheet health and position the company for long-term growth and value creation.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Marc for closing remarks.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Preet. We're proud of the operational, financial and strategic progress made in recent quarters. I want to emphasize that the underlying macro drivers of our business remain strong with the ongoing focus on global energy security and the growing need for low emissions natural gas, resulting in strong demand for Enerflex's Energy Infrastructure solutions. Against this backdrop, our business lines continue to deliver solid performance and we are focused on enhancing the profitability and resiliency of our core operations and Enerflex's ability to generate strong returns for our shareholders over the long term.\nI look forward to building on our progress and we will now hand the call to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Enerflex Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Jeff Fetterly.\n\nJeffrey Eric Fetterly\n\nPrincipal and Oilfield Services Analyst, Peters & Co. Limited, Research Division\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter of 2024 earnings call. With me today are Marc Rossiter, President and CEO; Preet Dhindsa, SVP and CFO; Ben Park, Vice President, Corporate Controller.\nDuring today's call, we'll speak to our second quarter results, outlook for the remainder of 2024 and provide an update on our target leverage framework as well as our long-term strategic and capital allocation priorities. Before I turn it over to Marc, I'll remind everyone that today's discussion will include non-IFRS and other financial measures, as well as forward-looking statements regarding Enerflex's expectations for future performance and business prospects. Forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties, and the stated expectations could differ materially from actual results or performance. For more information, refer to the advisory statements within our news release, MD&A, and other regulatory filings, all available on our website and under our SEDAR+ and EDGAR profiles.\nAs part of our prepared remarks, we will be referring to slides in our investor presentation, which is available on our website under the Investor Relations section.\nI'll now turn it over to Marc Rossiter, Enerflex's President and CEO.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us on this morning's call. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operational results that translated into a high watermark for adjusted EBITDA. These results reflect solid performance across our geographies and business lines as well as our ongoing efforts to optimize and streamline our business.\nThe energy infrastructure and aftermarket services business lines continue to deliver steady performance, generating 62% of our gross margin before depreciation and amortization during the quarter. In our Engineered Systems business line, results reflect favorable product mix and strong execution with visibility supported by a $1.3 billion backlog. I'll touch briefly on each of our business lines.\nEnergy infrastructure continues to perform well with the results supported by approximately $1.6 billion of revenue under contract. Our U.S. contract compression fleet is an important part of our energy infrastructure asset base, and the fundamentals for contract compression in the United States remain strong, led by increasing natural gas production in the Permian Basin.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, our U.S. contract compression fleet continued to operate at high utilization levels, averaging 94% across approximately 428,000 horsepower. The business generated revenues of $37 million, and gross margin before depreciation and amortization of 62% during the second quarter of 2024, compared to $33 million and 64% in the same period the prior year.\nSlide 11 of our investor presentation provides a summary of this business.\nOur international energy infrastructure business consists of approximately 1.5 million horsepower of compression, over 25 natural gas plants and 2 produced water treatment facilities. The remaining contract tenure across our asset base is approximately 5.5 years, and over 50% of this revenue for this business is generated in the Middle East.\nSlide 12 of our investor presentation provides a summary of this business.\nTurning to aftermarket services. This business line benefited from increased activity levels and customer maintenance activities during the quarter. We expect these trends to continue throughout 2024. We recorded Engineered Systems bookings of $331 million in the quarter, and maintained our backlog at $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter. The majority of the current backlog is expected to be converted to revenue over the next 12 months.\nFacility throughput remained steady, and margins for this business line have been helped by favorable product mix and strong project execution.\nWe continue to benefit from activity in oil-producing regions and with customers who maintain a positive medium-term view of natural gas fundamentals, although we are actively monitoring the near-term impact of weak natural gas prices on customer demand, notably in North America.\nTurning to the modularized cryogenic natural gas processing facility in Kurdistan. During the second quarter, Enerflex provided our client partner with notice of force majeure, suspended activity at the project site and demobilized our personnel. Work at the site remains suspended, and Enerflex continues to evaluate the situation in collaboration with our client partner and assesses next steps.\nAs we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to focus on enhancing our financial flexibility and strengthening the balance sheet. We generated $72 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year, while limiting growth capital expenditures to $9 million. We expect full year 2024 capital spending to be at the low end of our $90 million to $110 million guidance range as we continue to prioritize generating free cash flow, repaying debt, improving the leverage ratio and lowering net financing costs.\nBefore I turn the call over to Preet, I would like to thank the Enerflex team across our global operations for their efforts in delivering these results. The underlying macroeconomic drivers for our business are strong, and with the ongoing focus on global energy security and the growing need for low emissions natural gas, our business lines continue to deliver solid performance. We are focused on enhancing the profitability of our core operations and Enerflex's ability to focus on growth and return capital to shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Preet to speak to the financial highlights of the quarter, and provide an update on Enerflex's outlook for the balance of 2024.\n\nPreet Dhindsa\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we reported consolidated revenue of $614 million compared to $579 million in Q2 '23 and $638 million in Q1 '24. Removing the impact in Q1 '24 of a treated water solutions project being converted from an operating lease to a finance lease, the second quarter represents an increase in revenue, both sequentially and year-over-year. Gross margin before depreciation and amortization was $173 million or 28% of revenue, compared to $145 million or 25% of revenue in Q2 '23, and $119 million or 19% of revenue during Q1 '24. Adjusted EBITDA was $122 million compared to $107 million in Q2 '23 and $69 million during Q1 '24.\nEnergy Infrastructure gross margin before D&A of $77 million was relatively consistent with recent quarters, and reflective of the strong contract position that supports our assets.\nAftermarket Services gross margin before D&A was 23% in the quarter, benefiting from increased activity levels and strong customer maintenance programs.\nEnerflex's SG&A of $75 million was consistent on a year-over-year basis after normalizing the prior year quarter for a $10 million reversal of bad debt expense and declined sequentially due to lower share-based compensation.\nForeign exchange losses and losses from associated instruments remained modest during Q2 '24, reflective of effective cash management strategies and lower cash balances in Argentina.\nCash provided by operating activities was $12 million in Q2 '24, which included a working capital investment of $51 million. The build in working capital during the second quarter was principally related to an $85 million net movement in deferred revenue and unbilled revenue. These changes are connected primarily to the execution of projects in our Engineered Systems backlog and relate to the timing difference that exist between when we receive milestone payments from client partners, and recognize the cost and revenue associated with completing the projects.\nEnerflex emphasize that each project maintains a positive cash position during execution, but this can result in fluctuations in working capital. The past 4 quarters are a good example of this, as we received a net inflow of $107 million from deferred revenue and unbilled revenue during the second half of '23, an additional inflow of $59 million during the first quarter of '24 and saw a net build of $85 million during the second quarter.\nIn Q2 '24, the investment deferred revenue or unbilled revenue is partially offset by steady collections of accounts receivable and finance leases, which totaled $29 million. A detailed summary of net working capital movement for the 3 and 6 months of 2024 and '23 is included in Note 9 of the financial statement.\nLooking at the second half of 2024, we expect net working capital movement to be a modest source of cash for Enerflex. Free cash flow was used $6 million compared to a source of cash of $78 million in Q1 '24, and a use of cash of $20 million in the comparable quarter of '23. The variability of free cash flow is directly connected to the changes in net working capital I just described.\nWe invested $10 million in the business during the second quarter, including $1 million of growth CapEx, and returned $3 million to shareholders through dividends.\nWe exited the quarter with a net debt of $763 million, which included $126 million of cash and available liquidity of $512 million.\nDuring Q2 '24, Enerflex extended the maturity date of our secured revolving credit facility by 1 year to October 13, 2026. Availability under the RCF was increased to $800 million from $700 million. And in conjunction with the extension, Enerflex repaid $120 million of outstanding amounts under our secured term loan using cash on hand and availability under the expanded RCF.\nEnerflex is targeting bank adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2x over the medium term. The leverage framework is underpinned by the highly utilized U.S. contract compression fleet, contracted international EI product line and the recurring nature of our AMS business.\nOur leverage ratio was 2.2x at the end of Q2, and we remain on track to reach our leverage framework.\nIn terms of the outlook for the second half of the year, Enerflex continues to see consistent demand across all business lines and geographic regions, including high utilization of EI assets and the AMS business line.\nEnerflex's EI product line is supported by customer contracts, which are expected to generate approximately $1.6 billion of revenue during the current remaining terms. We continue to expect the energy infrastructure, and aftermarket services product lines will account for 55% to 65% of gross margin before D&A June 2024.\nComplementing Enerflex's recurring revenue businesses is the ES product line. ES results will be supported by a strong backlog of approximately $1.3 billion in projects as at June 30, 2024, with the majority of this work expected to convert to revenue over the next 12 months.\nEnerflex continues to target a disciplined capital program in 2024 with total capital expenditures of $90 million to $110 million. This includes a total of approximately $70 million for maintenance and PP&E capital expenditures.\nAs Marc mentioned in his remarks, as a result of efforts to optimize capital spending, Enerflex expects full year '24 CapEx be at the low end of the guidance range. Growth capital will be allocated only to customer supported opportunities that are expected to generate attractive returns and deliver value to Enerflex shareholders. The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of CAD 0.025 per share payable on October 2, 2024, to shareholders of record on August 22. Providing meaningful returns to shareholders is a priority for Enerflex.\nOnce the company is operating within our target leverage range, Enerflex expects to re-evaluate capital allocation priorities, which could include increased dividends, share repurchases, additional growth capital spending and/or further debt repayments. Allocation decisions will be based on providing the most attractive shareholder returns, measured against Enerflex's ability to maintain balance sheet strength.\nI'll conclude by saying that with the support of Enerflex's strong global leadership team and talented employees, we are improving the profitability and resiliency of our business, with an objective to generate sustainable free cash flow.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Marc for closing remarks.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Preet. We're encouraged by the strong operating performance of the global business. We are focused on ensuring the safety and security of our personnel while we work to further enhance the profitability of our core operations, simplify our operational and geographic footprint, maximize cash flow generation to strengthen our financial position, realize the benefits and synergies from the Exterran acquisition and continue to offer best-in-class natural gas, treated water, and energy transition solutions to our client partners.\nI look forward to building on our progress to create significant value and optionality across geographies, customers and product lines.\nI will now hand the call back to the operator for questions.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce the Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Jeff Fetterly.\n\nJeffrey Eric Fetterly\n\nPrincipal and Oilfield Services Analyst, Peters & Co. Limited, Research Division\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter of 2024 earnings call. With me today are Marc Rossiter, President and CEO; Preet Dhindsa, SVP and CFO; and Ben Park, Vice President, Corporate Controller.\nDuring today's call, our prepared remarks will focus on 3 key areas: first, the strong operational performance of the business Tier 1 and our outlook for the balance of 2024. An update on the modularized cryogenic natural gas processing facility in the Middle East that Enerflex has been constructing for a client partner; and third, our progress on near- and long-term strategic earnings.\nBefore I turn it over to Mark, I'll remind everyone that today's discussion will include non-IFRS and other financial measures as well as forward-looking statements regarding Enerflex' expectations for future performance and business prospects. Forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties, and the stated expectations could differ materially from actual results or performance. For more information, refer to the advisory statements within our news release, MD&A and other regulatory filings, all available on our website and under our SEDAR and EDGAR profiles.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the company changed its presentation currency from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars to provide more relevant reporting of Enerflex's financial position. As a result, all amounts discussed on this call are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated. As part of our prepared remarks, we will also be referring to slides in our investor presentation, which is available on our website under the Investor Relations section.\nI'll now turn it over to Marc Rossiter, Enerflex's President and CEO.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us on this conference call. Yesterday, Enerflex reported its first quarter 2024 results, which reflect solid operating results across our geographies and business lines. The energy infrastructure and aftermarket service business lines continue to generate stable, sustainable returns. These businesses are the foundation of Enerflex's financial performance generating approximately 73% of our gross margin before depreciation and amortization over the past 12 months, and we believe underwrite the majority of the company's current debt.\nTurning to the specifics of our business. I'll begin with our energy infrastructure business line, which includes 2 main parts: contract compression operations in the United States, and compression, processing and treated water assets located in the Middle East and Latin America. Performance of our U.S. contract compression business continues to be very solid with a fleet size of approximately [ 4 ] 24,000 horsepower and utilization that has exceeded 90% for 2 consecutive years. The business generates approximately 16% of our gross margin before depreciation and amortization over the past 12 months.\nThe fundamentals for contract compression in the United States remain very strong, led by increasing natural gas production in the Permian Basin and we have been focused on adding electric drive units to support larger client partners in their [ reenergization ] efforts. Further details of our U.S. contract compression business is included on Slide 7 of our investor presentation.\nOur international energy infrastructure business operates in 7 countries and includes nearly 1.5 million horsepower of compression over 25 natural gas processing plants and 2 treated water facilities. We have approximately $1.5 billion of go-forward revenue and payments under contract with a weighted average contract term exceeding 5 years and extending out to 2023. Slide 8 of our investor presentation provides more detail around our international energy infrastructure business.\nDuring Q1 '24, Enerflex expanded the scope and extended the term of an existing build-own-operate-maintain contract in the Eastern Hemisphere. The contract supports the expansion of the company's treated water solutions business, increases Enerflex's presence in a core operating country of Oman and is expected to double Enerflex's revenue from the project and improve the company's returns during its additional 4-year term. As prescribed by International Finance Reporting Standards, the contract is now being accounted for as a finance lease.\nTurning to the aftermarket services business. This segment is benefiting from increased activity levels, inflationary price adjustments and continued strong demand for spare parts. We expect these trends to continue throughout 2024. Our Engineered Systems product line recorded strong bookings and is steadily executing through its backlog. Our book-to-bill ratio was above 1x during the quarter as we received several large orders, resulting in our order backlog increasing to $1.3 billion at the end of Q1, a new quarterly record for Enerflex. We are especially pleased with the success of our cryogenic natural gas processing business line with Enerflex receiving orders for 6 large-scale facilities during 2023 and 2 additional facilities thus far in 2024. This demand is a reflection of our expanded product on stemming from the external transaction.\nWe are relatively -- while we are actively monitoring the near-term impact of weak natural gas prices on customer demand, notably in North America, order activity in Engineered Systems continues to benefit from activity in oil-producing regions and with customers who maintain a positive medium-term view of U.S. natural gas fundamentals. As previously mentioned, the fundamentals for contract compression in the U.S. remained strong, led by increasing natural gas production in the Permian Basin.\nNow I'd like to provide an update on a modularized cryogenic natural gas processing facility in the Middle East, which we will refer to as the East Cryo Project. As at March 31, 2024, construction of the EH Cryo project was approximately 85% complete. However, construction has progressed at a slower pace than expected, and the expected cost to complete have increased. As a result, gross margin and adjusted dollar reduced by $41 million based on the company's estimate of the remaining spend to complete the project of approximately $105 million. However, subsequent to Q1 '24, in response to [ hydrogen assaulted ] in fatalities at an operational facility in proximity to the EH Cryo project, Enerflex has provided its client partner with notice of force majeure suspended activity at the project site and demobilized our personnel. We extend our deepest condolences to the families of the people killed and those that have been affected by this attack. While no Enerflex personnel were injured and there is no physical damage to company's assets, work at the site is suspended as Enerflex evaluates the situation in collaboration with our client partner and assesses next steps.\nAs we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on enhancing our financial flexibility and strengthening the balance sheet. We were opt to have repaid an additional $72 million of debt during Q1. We bringing the total debt reduction since the beginning of 2023 to $190 million. Our leverage ratio was reduced to 2.2 at the end of March. In '24, we will continue to prioritize generating free cash flow repaying debt, improving our leverage ratio and lowering our overall net finance costs.\nBefore the call over to Preet, I want to emphasize that the underlying macro drivers of our business are strong. with the ongoing focus on global energy security and the growing need for low emissions natural gas, resulting in strong demand for Enerflex's energy infrastructure and energy transition solutions. Against this backdrop, our business lines continue to deliver solid performance, and we are focused on enhancing the profitability of our core operations and Enerflex's ability to focus on growth and return of capital to shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Preet to speak to the financial highlights of the quarter and provide an update on Enerflex's outlook for 2024.\n\nPreet Dhindsa\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, consolidated revenue of $638 million increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Higher revenue is mainly attributable to the EI product line and converge of the treated water solutions project Mark referenced earlier, from an operating lease to a finance lease.\nGross margin before depreciation and amortization this quarter of $119 million or [ 19% ] compared to $156 million or 26% of revenue in Q1 '23, and $159 million or 28% of revenue during Q4 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $69 million compared to $90 million in Q1 '23 and $91 million during Q2 '23.\nDelays and increased cost in the completion of the EH Cryo project reduced gross margin adjusted EBITDA by $41 million during the first quarter. This project is recognized as a sale within the Engineered Systems product line as construction proceeds and is presented as an unbilled revenue asset on Enerflex's consolidated statements of financial position. The net unbilled contract revenue asset recognized for the EH Cryo project at the end of Q1 '24 is $147 million and remaining revenue to be recognized is approximately [ 11% ] of the company's Engineered Systems backlog. There can be no assurance that the security situation will improve and while work is suspended, Enerflex will not incur any material construction expenditures to complete the EH Cryo project.\nExcluding the impact of the EH Cryo project, gross margin before D&A for our Engineered Systems business was 19% compared to 16% in the first quarter of 2023. Energy Infrastructure gross margin before D&A of $80 million was relatively consistent with recent quarters, reflective of the strong contract position that supports our assets. Our aftermarket services gross margin before depreciation and amortization was 22% in the quarter, benefiting from increased activity levels, inflationary price adjustments and continued strong demand for parts.\nEnerflex's SG&A of $78 million was steady year-over-year but declined usually as a result of lower transaction restructuring and integration costs. Foreign exchange losses and losses from associated instruments were down significantly from Q4 '23, reflective of cash management strategies and lower cash balances remaining in Argentina. Cash provided by operating activities was $101 million in Q1 '24, which included a working capital recovery of $83 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, we generated $158 million of cash from operations, including $110 million from the recovery of working capital. We are pleased with our ongoing global efforts to efficiently manage working capital, although we do not expect the magnitude of the recovery realized over the past 2 quarters will be repeated.\nDuring the first quarter, Enerflex generated $78 million of free cash flow compared to $140 million in Q4 '23 and a used cash of $3 million in the comparable quarter of 2023. We invested $17 million in the business during the first quarter, include [ $8 million ] of growth investments and returned $2 million to shareholders through dividends.\nWe reduced net debt by $72 million during the quarter, exiting a $743 million and reduced our bank adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x. The company maintained strong liquidity with access to $548 million under its credit facility end of Q1, and we continue to look at opportunities to extend our maturities and optimize our debt stack. As Mark mentioned, Enerflex will continue to focus on debt reduction and lowering net finance costs in 2024, which will improve our ability to deliver on further growth by shareholder returns over the medium and long term.\nLet me shift to our outlook where visibility for the majority of the company's operations is strong. We continue to expect the energy infrastructure and aftermarket services product lines will account for 55% to 65% of gross margin before D&A during 2024. The majority of the record Engineered Systems backlog of $1.3 billion at March 31, '24, is expected to convert to revenue over the next 12 months. Enerflex continues to target a disciplined capital program in 2024 with total expenditures of $90 million to $110 million. This includes a total of approximately $70 million of maintenance and [ PPD ] capital expenditures. Investments to expand the energy infrastructure business are discretionary and will be allocated to customer support opportunities expected to generate attractive returns and create value for Enerflex shareholders.\nEnerflex is committed to paying a sustainable quarterly dividend to shareholders. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of [ CAD ] 0.02 per share payable on July 11, 2024, to shareholders of record on May 23, 2024. Finally, we announced that Mexico ruled in favor of Enerflex relating to a long-standing dispute of an employee severance pay following termination of employment in [ May 15 ]. The matter has now been returned to the labor board to issue a new judgment in accordance with the court's ruling, which supports Enerflex's view that ultimate resolution of this matter by the labor board will be immaterial.\nI'll conclude by saying that with the support of Enerflex strong global leadership team and employees we are improving the profitability and resiliency of our global business with an objective to sustainable free cash flow. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark for closing remarks.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Preet. Enerflex' first quarter operational results highlight our continued ability to successfully execute our strategy across 3 core businesses around the world. Our commitment to our key priorities remains steadfast. We are focused on ensuring the safety and security of our personnel while we work to further enhance profitability of core operations, simplify our operational and geographic footprint, maximize cash flow generated to strengthen our financial position, realize the benefits and synergies from the Exterran acquisition and continue to offer best-in-class natural gas treated water and energy transition solutions to our customers. I look forward to building on our progress to create significant value across geographies, customers and product lines.\nI will now hand the call back to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to the Enerflex Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Jeff Fetterly, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJeffrey Eric Fetterly\n\nPrincipal and Oilfield Services Analyst, Peters & Co. Limited, Research Division\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings call. With me today are Marc Rossiter, President and CEO; Preet Dhindsa, Interim CFO; and Ben Park, Vice President, Corporate Controller. During today's call, we'll speak to our fourth quarter and year-end results, outlook for 2024 and provide an update on how we are progressing on our near- and long-term strategic priorities.\nBefore I turn it over to Marc, I'll remind everyone that today's discussion will include non-IFRS and other financial measures as well as forward-looking statements regarding Enerflex' expectations for future performance and business prospects. Forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties, and the stated expectations could differ materially from actual results or performance. For more information, refer to the advisory statements within our news release, MD&A and other regulatory filings, all available on our website and under our SEDAR and EDGAR profiles. All dollar amounts discussed today are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. I'll now turn it over to our President and CEO, Marc Rossiter.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThank you all for joining us in this morning's call. Yesterday, Enerflex reported its fourth quarter and year-end 2023 results, which reflect a strong finish to the year and solid operating results across our geographies. Our energy infrastructure and aftermarket services business lines demonstrated steady performance in 2023 and are positioned to continue driving stable, sustainable returns, thanks to Enerflex's diversified global footprint.\nApproximately 2/3 of Enerflex's gross margin before depreciation and amortization, both for Q4 and full year 2023 was generated from recurring sources. In markets outside North America contributed approximately 50% of our total gross margin during this period. Our Engineered Systems product line achieved record annual revenue during 2023 and successfully navigated a volatile supply chain environment to deliver solid margins.\nTouching briefly on the quarter, Enerflex delivered adjusted EBITDA of $126 million and free cash flow of $185 million, demonstrating the strength and continued momentum from our recurring businesses as well as the Engineered Systems product line. Energy infrastructure is generating stable results, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to maximize performance across our geographic platform. our U.S. contract compression asset is operating at high utilization rates, averaging 93% in the fourth quarter. The aftermarket services business is benefiting from increased activity levels price adjustments and continued strong demand for spare parts and services.\nWe recorded Engineered Systems bookings of $327 million in the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year, reflecting demand across 3 continents and solid client activity levels. However, bookings during the fourth quarter reflect a CCUS project that was canceled after our client was unable to secure required pipeline approvals. The project was originally booked in 2022.\nDespite the cancellation, Enerflex continues to see strong client activity across our regions, including the United States. We are especially pleased with the success of our cryogenic natural gas processing business line. with Enerflex receiving orders for 5 large-scale facilities during 2023 and an additional facility award in early 2024. This is a reflection of our expanded product offerings stemming from the Exterran transaction.\nAs we enter 2024, visibility across our business is strong, supported by contract coverage across our energy infrastructure assets, the recurring nature of aftermarket service and a $1.5 billion Engineered Systems backlog Shifting to the integration of Exterran. We are in the home stretch with efforts focused on final systems integration. We have updated our synergy guidance to reflect annual run rate synergies, having exceeded our previous target of USD 60 million. Recent achievements include the streamlining of our global manufacturing footprint, exiting several noncore geographies and monetization of noncore assets.\nWe expect these actions, coupled with their focus on further enhancing the profitability of our core operations to enable continued debt reduction throughout 2024 and enhance Enerflex's ability to deliver shareholder returns in the mid- to long term. We remain committed to enhancing our financial position, repaying $167 million of long-term debt in the quarter and reduced our leverage ratio to 2.3 at the end of December, consistent with our guidance.\nOur focus remains on strengthening the balance sheet and enhancing the company's financial flexibility. We were pleased to recently announce the appointment of Preet Dhindsa as Senior Vice President and CFO effective March 1. Preet has provided solid leadership and financial stewardship since joining Enerflex in October, and I'm excited to welcome him as our CFO at this important time for our company. We look forward to his continued leadership of Enerflex's strong global financial organization as we continue to unlock the benefits of the Exterran acquisition and position our company for long-term growth and value creation.\nBefore I turn the call over to Preet, I want to emphasize that the underlying macro drivers for our business are strong. with the ongoing focus on global energy security and the growing need for low emissions natural gas, resulting in strong demand for Enerflex' energy infrastructure and energy transition solutions. With that, I'll turn it over to Preet to speak to the financial highlights of the quarter and provide an update on Enerflex' outlook for 2024.\n\nPreet Dhindsa\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm pleased to continue my work at Enerflex and help unlock the business' full potential for the benefit of our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders. My efforts will be focused on supporting the execution of our global strategy, improving the profitability and resiliency of the business, generating sustainable free cash flow and strengthening our financial position.\nTurning to our financial results. Enerflex met or exceeded all of its full year 2023 financial guidance metrics as last provided with our third quarter results in November. During the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue of $782 million was largely consistent with third quarter levels and driven by continued strong performance from Enerflex's recurring businesses. Gross margin before depreciation and amortization or D&A, increased to $216 million or 28% of revenue compared to $201 million or 26% of revenue in Q3 2023.\nEnergy Infrastructure and aftermarket services product lines generated 67% of consolidated gross margin before D&A during the fourth quarter of 2023, which is comparable with the third quarter. Energy Infrastructure gross margin before D&A of $104 million was relatively consistent with the previous quarters in the year. In Engineered Systems, our gross margin before D&A improved to 18% and as we execute on higher-margin backlog. And our aftermarket services gross margin before G&A was 22% in the quarter, the highest level over 2 years and reflective of increased activity levels, inflationary price adjustments and continued strong demand for spare parts. Enerflex' SG&A of $102 million declined $13 million from the third quarter, which was largely driven by lower compensation costs.\nForeign exchange losses, which were previously included in SG&A are now presented as a separate line item on our income statement. Transaction, restructuring integration costs were $25 million in Q4 compared to $6 million in Q3 as we incurred cost rates consolidating our operations and integrating systems. We expect to incur approximately $30 million of restructuring and integration costs during 2024. As Marc mentioned, we're in the home stretch of completing the integration with efforts focused on final systems integration.\nOur adjusted EBITDA was $126 million in the fourth quarter compared to $122 million in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA was reduced this quarter by $39 million, resulting from losses related to foreign exchange and associated instruments, principally in Argentina. We generated $4 million in offsetting interest income that is reported in net finance costs and excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Enerflex continues to manage foreign exchange volatility and is implementing measures to reduce exposure to the Argentine peso. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our business in Argentina continues to perform well and generate strong operating cash flow for the business.\nCash provided by operating activities was $209 million, which included a working capital recovery of $144 million. In the third quarter, we generated $71 million of cash from operations, including $15 million from the recovery of working capital. We are pleased with our ongoing global efforts to more efficiently manage working capital and target further progress in 2024, although we do not expect that the magnitude of the recovery realized during Q4 will be repeated. We've also introduced free cash flow as a key performance measure for our company. Free cash flow helps readers assess the level of free cash available to fund other nonoperating activities such as growth capital expenditures, discretionary debt repayment, share repurchases and/or incremental dividends.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Enerflex generated $185 million of free cash flow compared to a use of cash of $46 million in the comparable quarter of 2022. Including free cash flow for the fourth quarter is a benefit of $52 million related to unrealized changes in foreign exchange and short-term investments. While we do not experience an outflow of cash associated with these unrealized losses, the impact of cash available to fund other nonoperating activities. We invested $24 million in the business during the fourth quarter, including $6 million of growth investments and returned $3 million to shareholders through dividends.\nAs Marc mentioned, our focus remains on strengthening the balance sheet and enhancing the company's financial flexibility. We reduced net debt by $151 million during the quarter, exiting the year at $1.1 billion and reduced our bank adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.3x from 2.7x at the end of Q3 and 3.3x at the end of 2022.\nEnerflex will continue to focus on debt reduction, global cash management and lowering net finance costs in 2024, which will improve our ability to provide shareholder returns over the medium and long term. We continue to evaluate our target long-term capital structure and capital allocation parameters and expect to provide more clarity in the coming months.\nLet me shift to our outlook for 2024. Operating results will be underpinned by the highly contracted energy infrastructure product line and the recurring nature of aftermarket services. which together are expected to account for 55% to 65% of gross margin before depreciation and amortization. Complementing Enerflex's recurring revenue businesses is the Engineered Systems product line. which carried a backlog of $1.5 billion as at December 31, 2023. The company expects the majority of its backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nEnerflex is targeting a disciplined capital program in 2024 with total capital expenditures of $90 million to $110 million. This includes a total of approximately $70 million for maintenance and PP&E capital expenditures. Investing to expand our energy infrastructure business in 2024 is discretionary and will be allocated to customers supported opportunities that are expected to generate attractive returns and deliver value to Enerflex shareholders.\nFinally, Enerflex is committed to delivering a sustainable dividend to shareholders with our Board declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2024, to shareholders of record March 13, 2024. I'll conclude by saying that with the support of Enerflex's strong global leadership team and talented employees we're improving the profitability and resiliency of our overall business with an objective to generate sustainable free cash flow. I'm pleased to continue my work at Enerflex and help unlock the business full potential for the benefit of our shareholders. customers, employees and other stakeholders. With that, over to you, Marc, for closing remarks.",

All dollar amounts discussed today are in Canadian dollars otherwise started.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our President and CEO, Marc Rossiter.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and thank you all for joining me on this morning's call. Last night, Enerflex reported its third quarter 2023 results, which reflect the significant progress we're making in advancing our strategic priorities, including the continued integration of Exterran. .\nOur recent results and progress to date also underscore that we have more work ahead of us to unlock the full potential of our combined company. Our global footprint, expanded product offerings and deepened ability to serve the energy value chain is generating operational results that are less influenced by the economics, rig counts and commodity prices of any single region or producing basin.\nDuring the first 9 months of 2023, approximately 60% of Enerflex's gross margin was generated from recurring sources and markets outside North America contributed 43% of the company's total gross margin during the same period.\nI'm pleased to report that we delivered strong operating results across all of our geographies. Integration and synergy realization activities related to the Exterran acquisition remain on track.\nSince close, Exterran has captured approximately $50 million -- sorry, Enerflex has captured approximately USD 50 million of annual run rate synergies, and expect to realize the remaining USD 10 million for a total of USD 60 million of anticipated synergies within the next 6 months.\nIn addition, the company continues to review opportunities to optimize its geographic footprint and business platform. To this end, we are in the process of consolidating our global manufacturing facilities from 5 to 3 and in the early part of the fourth quarter, completed the sale of 2 noncore assets for gross proceeds of approximately $40 million. We expect these actions, combined with additional optimization efforts will drive cash flow, enabled long -- enable continued debt reduction and enhance our ability to generate shareholder returns over the mid and long term.\nTouching briefly in the quarter, Enerflex delivered adjusted EBITDA of $122 million and operating cash flow of $71 million, demonstrating the strength and continued momentum from our curving businesses as well as the North American Engineered Systems product line.\nWe recorded strong Engineered Systems bookings in the quarter of $560 million, bringing our year-to-date total in the first 9 months of 2023 to $1.4 billion, an increase of approximately $500 million year-over-year.\nOur bookings reflect demand originating from 3 continents. And highlight robust customer activity levels, particularly in North America and notably for Cryogenic and low-carbon solutions. Our bookings during the first 3 quarters of 2023 include $153 million for Cryogenic projects outside of North America and USD 111 million related to projects that advance our energy transition business strategy.\nOur record Engineered Systems backlog of $1.6 billion provides strong visibility into revenue generation and business activity levels for 2024. Energy Infrastructure contributed approximately 40% of gross margin during the quarter. This business is generating stable results, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to maximize performance across our geographic platform.\nOur U.S. contract compression fleet is operating at high utilization rates of 93% in the quarter. The aftermarket services business is benefiting from increased activity levels, inflationary price adjustments and continued strong demand for spare parts.\nWe remain committed to enhancing our financial position and repaid $41 million of long-term debt in the quarter, which is consistent with our focus on strengthening the balance sheet and enhancing the company's financial flexibility. However, our reported long-term debt declined by only $5 million in the quarter due to the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar.\nOn today's call, I also have the pleasure of introducing Preet Dhindsa, who announced -- who we announced as our interim CFO last month, and Jeff Fetterly is our new VP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations.\nPreet is a seasoned financial leader with more than 25 years of experience, primarily in the energy and financial service industries. He brings a proven track record of leading large international finance organizations, including through post-merger integration activities. Jeff is well known to many listeners as a well-regarded thought leader in energy equity analysis. I'm excited to be working with Jeff and Preet at this important time for our company, and I'm confident that their experience will serve Enerflex shareholder as well.\nBefore I turn the call over to Preet, I'd like to emphasize that the underlying macro drivers for our business are robust. With the ongoing focus on global energy security, the growing need for low emissions natural gas, resulting in a strong demand for Enerflex's energy infrastructure and energy transition solutions. As customers aim to decarbonize their operations, Enerflex is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable energy infrastructure through our vertically integrated natural gas produced water treatment and energy transition offerings.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Preet to speak to the financial highlights of the quarter and provide an update on Enerflex's outlook for the balance of 2023 and 2024.\n\nPreet Dhindsa\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I am excited to step into the CFO role to get pivotal time for Enerflex. I've hit the ground running to support the strong global finance team as you work to ensure the company has financial stability and flexibility through industry cycles.\nOur consolidated third quarter revenues of $778 million were driven by continued strong performance from Enerflex's recurring businesses and North American Engineered Systems product line.\nEnerflex's gross margin was $146 million or 19% of revenue comparable to Q2 2023. Energy Infrastructure gross margin decreased quarter-over-quarter to 30%, primarily related to higher depreciation. Engineered Systems, our gross margin improved to 15% as we execute on higher-margin backlog. Our aftermarket services gross margin was 17% in Q3 2023 compared to 20% in the prior quarter, reflective of the sales mix that included a higher proportion of part sales compared to most recent quarters.\nEnerflex's SG&A of $115 million increased by $15 million over the second quarter, which was largely driven by a onetime bad debt recovery of $12 million does recognize in the second quarter. Transaction, restructuring and integration costs were $6 billion in Q3 compared to $12 million in Q2. We do expect to see additional cost for restructuring and optimization. Although, as Mark mentioned, integration and synergy realization activities remain well on track.\nThis brings me to our adjusted EBITDA of $122 million in the third quarter. Included adjusted EBITDA are foreign exchange losses of $17 million during the quarter related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso. We continue to actively manage this exposure and generate $11 million of offsetting gains from associated instruments. The majority of this amount is reported in net finance cost and excluded from the adjusted EBITDA number we reported.\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange, our business in Argentina continues to perform well and generate strong operating cash flow for the company. Enerflex also continues to manage foreign exchange volatility with the majority of exposure to the Argentine peso, offset by associated instruments.\nCash provided by operating activities was $71 million in the quarter, which included a working capital recovery of $15 million. Comparatively, in the second quarter, cash used in operating activities was $4 million. A $75 million positive swing Q-over-Q.\nWe invested $26 million in capital expenditures, including $8 million of maintenance capital across the global energy infrastructure fleet and returned $3 million to shareholders through dividends. Enerflex's primary focus for 2023 is to progress the integration of Exterran and strengthen our financial position.\nDuring the third quarter, we repaid $41 million of long-term debt. Although reported long-term debt declined by only $5 million, including the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar.\nWe reduced our bank adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.7x at the end of Q3. From 3.3x at the end of 2022. And we are on track to achieve a ratio of slightly less or less than 2.5x by year-end 2023. We are reaffirming all of our full year 2023 financial guidance as last provided with our second quarter results.\nWe anticipate adjusted EBITDA as currently reported to be at the low end of this guidance range, inclusive of the impact from volatility to foreign exchange markets, specifically Argentina.\nPlease note, foreign exchange losses of $41 million during the 9 months ended September 2023, related to devaluation of the Argentine peso is included in our adjusted EBITDA.\nWe continue to target total 2023 PP&E and growth capital expenditures of USD 80 million to USD 90 million. which includes 2 large water projects that were commissioned in the first quarter and various small-scale customer section project in the U.S., Latin America and Eastern Hemisphere.\nHeading into 2024, we expect our performance to be underpinned by recurring energy infrastructure and aftermarket services product line and a robust Engineered Systems backlog. Enerflex is targeting a disciplined capital program in 2024. Consistent with our current focus, we will continue to prioritize debt reduction, synergy realization and operational efficiency. The company continues to review its target long-term capital structure and capital allocation parameters, and we expect to provide more clarity in the coming months.\nFinally, Enerflex is committed to delivering a sustainable dividend to shareholders with our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share. The dividend is payable on January 10 to shareholders of record on November 21.\nBefore I turn it over to Mark, I will conclude by saying that within the support of Enerflex's strong leadership team and talented employees, we are improving the profitability and resiliency of the global business with an objective to generate sustainable cash flow. I am excited to have joined this team and to help unlock the business full potential for the benefit of our shareholders, customers, employees and stakeholders.\nWith that, over to you, Mark, for closing remarks.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Preet.

In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $777 million and adjusted EBITDA of $142 million, demonstrating the strength of our energy infrastructure and aftermarket services business lines as well as continued momentum in our North American Engineered Systems business.\nThe gross margin profile on our recurring businesses expanded from the first quarter. Our energy infrastructure platform benefited from more favorable terms on renewals and additional contracted revenues generated from the new energy infrastructure assets we brought online in the first half of the year. And our aftermarket services business benefited from increased activity levels, including continued global demand for spare parts.\nNotably, our aftermarket services gross margin has increased by over 500 basis points from 2022 levels.\nOur gross margin profile from Engineered Systems has also improved significantly from this time last year, up 400 basis points. However, operational delays on certain in-flight projects resulted in a lower gross margin percentage in the quarter versus the prior quarter. We are focused on regaining lost time experienced on those projects to improve their margins.\nI'd like to quickly touch on some key activities across our business segments. Our North American business continues to perform exceptionally well across all product lines. Customer activity levels remain elevated, which has enabled us to capitalize on new opportunities and expand our booked margins. Our U.S. contract compression fleet is operating at high utilization rates, averaging 96% in the second quarter. And as a result, we are securing attractive pricing in this tight compression market. Our aftermarket services business is observing notable strength in gross margin improvements as customers continue to catch up on deferred maintenance activities and general parts and supply needs. And our Engineered Systems business continues to be a meaningful contributor, especially as we look to book -- sorry, especially as we book larger cryogenic natural gas processing plants, which I'll touch on later.\nIn Latin America, we are observing strong performance from our fleet of energy infrastructure assets and are focused on optimizing our contract compression business by redeploying idle units to meet rising local demand. We are also seeing solid activity levels in aftermarket services across the LatAm region.\nIn the Eastern Hemisphere, 3 of the 4 large in-flight projects that we -- that were being advanced through 2022 are complete and generating stable cash flows. We continue to advance the fourth in-flight project, the Cryogenic facility in Kurdistan, which we expect to complete in 2024.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on integrating Exterran. Since closing the transaction, we have captured most of the annual run rate synergies we identified at the time of the announcement, USD 50 million of the USD 60 million targeted and continue to expect that we will capture the remaining USD 10 million within 12 to 18 months of the transaction close. We are 9 months into our integration efforts and are actively streamlining our global operations to ensure we are shaping our business for long-term success and maximizing profitability and resiliency.\nAs we identify opportunities to optimize our global operations, we expect we will incur additional onetime restructuring and optimization costs, which should improve the overall efficiency of our business in the long term. An example of this is our previously announced plans to consolidate our global manufacturing capacity from 5 facilities to 3. We have since identified further opportunities to simplify our geographic footprint and plan to execute on these initiatives over the next 2 years.\nLastly, turning to our Engineered Systems business, Enerflex secured $322 million of bookings in the second quarter, allowing us to remain -- to maintain a significant backlog balance of $1.4 billion that we plan to convert into revenue through the balance of this year and into 2024. Notably, our second quarter bookings included $120 million of electrified natural gas infrastructure and another $20 million for carbon capture and sequestration related projects as we advance our energy transition business strategy.\nA strategic benefit from the Exterran acquisition that I'm particularly excited about is our expanded product offerings, which have deepened our ability to serve the energy value chain, and we have diversified our backlog composition. In the second quarter, we secured $80 million of bookings for 2 large cryogenic natural gas processing plants in the United States. This is in addition to the cryo plant we booked in the first quarter for an international customer. Today, we are better positioned to capture these larger scale opportunities, which should enable us to high-grade the margin profile of our Engineered Systems backlog.\nI will now turn it over to Rod to speak to the financial highlights from yesterday's release and provide an update on Enerflex's outlook for the balance of 2023.\n\nRodney D. Gray\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Baytex Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.\nEnerflex delivered strong financial and operational results in the second quarter. Revenues generated by our energy infrastructure and aftermarket services product lines were largely flat from the first quarter while gross margins from these recurring businesses expanded. Our consolidated second quarter revenues of $777 million were down from the first quarter because of the noncash finance lease revenue we recognized in the first quarter when we brought a large natural gas infrastructure asset into commercial operation.\nEnerflex's gross margin was $147 million or 18.9% as a percentage of revenue. And as Marc described, was influenced by solid quarter-over-quarter improvements in our recurring businesses. We did experience some delays on certain in-flight projects, which impacted our Engineered Systems margins. Still, we have expanded our gross margin on Engineered Systems through the first half of 2023 by over 400 basis points when we compare to the first half of '22 despite the lower margin on these particular projects during the second quarter.\nEnerflex's SG&A of $100 million decreased $16 million from the first quarter, which was largely driven by a recovery of a $12 million bad debt receivable. We are laser-focused on reducing our SG&A, but do expect to see -- continued to be impacted by foreign exchange losses related to the Argentine peso as well as onetime restructuring and integration costs as we optimize our global operations to enhance long-term profitability.\nIn the second quarter, we incurred $10 million of SG&A related restructuring and integration costs and recognized foreign exchange losses of $12 million, which we partially offset with $8 million of interest income from associated instruments reported against our net finance costs. This brings me to our reported adjusted EBITDA of $142 million in the second quarter. Strong business performance and an expanded energy infrastructure portfolio resulted in adjusted EBITDA increasing by 16% from the first quarter. Enerflex generated distributable cash flow at $52 million -- $32 million in capital expenditures directed primarily at our contract compression fleet in the U.S.A. and Latin America. We recognized a small net loss of $3 million, which was the result of higher cash taxes and lower gross margin recorded in the period, partially offset by the decrease in SG&A.\nEnerflex is focused on strengthening its financial position and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet over the long term. And in the second quarter, our long-term debt balance decreased by $50 million. The increase in net working capital resulting from the growth of our North American aftermarket services business as well as the timing of cash flows in our Engineered Systems businesses caused by our net debt balance to increase slightly from the end of the first quarter. Strong adjusted EBITDA generation allowed us to lower our bank adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.8x, and we continue to expect this ratio to improve to 2.5x by the end of the year through strong cash flow generation from our reoccurring business and the execution of our large Engineered Systems backlog. Once we've reached our post-acquisition deleveraging target, we plan to continue strengthening our financial position through absolute debt reduction to ensure we have significant financial flexibility through the industry cycles.\nWith last night's release, we reaffirmed our full year 2023 financial guidance for adjusted EBITDA, year-end leverage, maintenance capital expenditures and expenditures to execute the cryogenic facility in Kurdistan. Enerflex is revising its guidance for other nondiscretionary expenses to a range of USD 180 million to USD 210 million, representing a USD 50 million increase from the midpoint. This is to account for the increase in net working capital associated with higher activity levels in our aftermarket services and Engineered Systems businesses as well as higher expected cash taxes in 2023. Enerflex is also introducing guidance for PP&E and growth capital expenditures for the year with a range of USD 80 million to USD 90 million.\nThis guidance largely reflects Enerflex's year-to-date results, which include the completion of 2 large water projects in the first quarter. We invested about USD 55 million in PP&E and growth capital in the first half of the year, with the remaining funds for 2023 planned to be directed towards modest customer-sanctioned investments in our U.S. and Latin America contract compression fleets, a small brownfield expansion in the Middle East and PP&E investments and some software and upgrades required on facilities that we acquired through the transaction.\nFinally, Enerflex is committed to delivering a sustainable dividend to shareholders with our Board declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share last night. The dividend is payable on October 12 to shareholders of record on August 24. With that, I will pass it back to Marc to deliver his closing remarks.\n\nMarc Edward Rossiter\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Enerflex Ltd.\n\nThanks, Rod.\nEnerflex's primary focus for 2023 is to progress the integration of Exterran and strengthen our financial position. Our solid second quarter 2023 financial and operational results highlight our continued ability to execute on 3 core business lines on a global scale. We will continue to build on these strong results as we integrate Exterran with our near-term imperative of optimizing our business to be increasingly resilient and profitable to ensure maximum flexibility through the industry cycles.\nI will now hand the call back to the operator for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Trevor.\n\nTrevor Burns\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Investor Relations\n\nThanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 1Q2023 Earnings Conference Call.\nAlso, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full year 2023 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment [indiscernible]. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K.\nWe will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which [ will adjust for certain items ] affecting comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included in our earnings release and can be found on our IR website.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Equifax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 10% constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth as we executed well against our Equifax 2025 strategic priorities and the $200 million spending plan we announced in February.\nBefore I cover our strong results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and U.S. consumer. We continue to navigate a higher interest rate environment that has severely impacted the U.S. mortgage market. Mortgage originations were down 56% in 2022, and we expect them to be down about 32% this year. In the second half, we expect mortgage inquiries to be approaching an unprecedented 40% below 2015 to 2019 levels.\nThe combined market impact in '22 and '23 is expected to reduce Equifax revenue by over $900 million. But the breadth and depth of the Equifax business model and fast-growing non-mortgage businesses allowed Equifax to deliver 20% non-mortgage constant dollar growth last year and 4% total growth last year, and an expectation to deliver 8% non-mortgage and 4% total growth in 2023 at the midpoint of our guidance, more than offsetting the large negative impact from the unprecedented mortgage market decline.\nBroadly, consumers are still strong with unemployment at historically low levels and with modest increases in delinquencies. We're seeing some credit card and personal loan delinquency increases in subprime. And more broadly, DQs are now back to pre-pandemic levels, although they remain significantly below the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010. Auto loan delinquency rates for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels as well as above the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010.\nAnd as you know, delinquencies generally are manageable when people are working. While we have seen limited pockets of DQ increases, we continue to watch this important metric as we move through the rest of the year. Historically, as DQs increase, our customers will begin to reduce marketing and tighten originations.\nGross hiring year-to-date through February was down about 6%, slightly better than the trends we saw in the quarter. And inflation remains at elevated levels, but has begun to moderate slightly given Fed actions. But with inflation still well above Fed targets, we expect further rate increases. And we believe there has been some credit tightening at some customers, with more impact in fintech from both expectations of a slowing economy in the second half and capital issues impacting certain banks. As you recall, our guidance assumes a slowdown in the second half.\nWhile we are operating in an uncertain and challenging economic environment, Equifax continues to deliver. The breadth and depth of Equifax's broad-based business model is allowing us to weather this -- the unprecedented mortgage market decline and deliver revenue growth and margin expansion.\nTurning to Slide 4. Equifax had another strong quarter with non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth up 10%. First quarter reported revenue of $1.302 billion was down 4.5% and down 4.3% on an organic constant currency basis, and above our expectations against an unprecedented 58% mortgage market decline in the quarter. Revenue was above the high end of our February guidance from broad-based strength and execution across Equifax and continued strong new product rollouts.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $380 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.2%, both in line with our expectations. Adjusting for the incremental stock-based compensation expense incurred in the quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been approximately 31%, which is the baseline of which we expect to grow to 36% in the fourth quarter from revenue growth and our $120 million cost savings plan. As a reminder, the bulk of the spending reductions benefit the second half and we have $50 million of carryover benefit in 2024 from our actions this year.\nAdjusted EPS of $1.43 per share was above our February guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share from stronger-than-expected revenue growth.\nOur Equifax non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 80% of total revenue in the quarter were strong with 10% constant currency and 8% organic constant currency revenue growth, with the 10% growth solidly inside our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. All BUs delivered stronger-than-expected non-mortgage growth, which is positive momentum for the rest of the year.\nEstimated U.S. mortgage market originations, which MBA forecasts to be down about 58% in the quarter, were slightly weaker than the down 55% in our February framework. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was down about 33% or 25 points better than the market with both total revenue and our mortgage outperformance stronger than we outlined in February. The stronger outperformance was driven by better U.S. credit inquiries from higher-than-expected consumer shopping and positive mix in Workforce Solutions, driven by significant growth from our new Mortgage 36 trended product.\nWe continue to make significant progress driving completion of the Equifax data and technology transformation. At the end of the quarter, over 70% of Equifax is being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud, which will expand to 80% by year-end as we substantially complete the North America customer migrations to the Equifax Cloud.\nOur new Equifax Cloud infrastructure is delivering always-on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated datasets, faster data delivery, better data quality and industry-leading enterprise-level security. We continue to be convinced that our Equifax Cloud and Single Data Fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come.\nNew product innovation, leveraging the capabilities delivered by the Equifax Cloud, is also executing at a very high level. Our new product Vitality Index of 13% in the quarter is at record levels and 300 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality goal.\nAnd as you recall, in February, we reached a definitive agreement to acquire Boa Vista Services, the second-largest credit bureau in Brazil. When completed, the BVS acquisition will add $160 million of run rate revenue in the fast-growing Brazilian market. The transaction is subject to Boa Vista shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter.\nAs we outlined in February, we're executing a broad operational restructuring across Equifax, reflecting both the acceleration of our cloud transformation benefits and a broader focus on operational improvements aided by our new cloud capabilities. The plan will reduce our total workforce of over 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10% during 2023 as well as delivering cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers, and other broader spending controls.\nTotal spending reductions from these 2023 actions are expected to be about $200 million with about $120 million reduction in expense or about $0.75 per share and $80 million reduction in capital spending. And we're tracking well to the plans we laid out in February, and we remain committed to meeting these cost improvement targets. In 2024, the run rate benefit of these actions will reduce spending by an incremental $50 million to over $250 million.\nAnd we're maintaining our 2023 full year revenue guidance of $5.275 billion to $5.375 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $7.05 a share to $7.35 per share. Our guidance continues to assume a weakening U.S. and global economy in the second half.\nGiven the slightly weaker U.S. mortgage market that we saw principally in March, we are now assuming U.S. mortgage market inquiries for 2023 to be down about 32% or 200 basis points weaker than we discussed in February. Given our strong and broad-based performance in the first quarter, our ability to continue to outperform our underlying markets and execution on our planned 2023 spending reductions, we are reaffirming our 2023 guidance in a continued challenging mortgage market and expected slowing economy in the second half.\nWe also continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of over 36% in the fourth quarter, which is a very important stepping-off point for 2024. John will provide more detail on the overall mortgage market and our second quarter and full year guidance shortly.\nTurning to Slide 5. In the first quarter, we continued our strong non-mortgage revenue performance, delivering 10% constant dollar and 8% organic constant currency revenue growth. All 3 business units delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth in the quarter, with Workforce up 11%, International up 10% in constant currency and USIS up 8%. This broad-based non-mortgage growth across the business units will be increasingly supported by completion of the Equifax Cloud and continued NPI growth across the businesses.\nFirst quarter constant dollar non-mortgage growth of 10% was well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue framework despite some slowdown in U.S. hiring activity that impacted EWS' Talent Solutions and I-9 businesses, as well as the comparison off a very strong 25% non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth in the first quarter last year.\nTurning to Slide 6. Workforce Solutions delivered another very strong quarter with non-mortgage revenue growth up 11% and total revenue down 8%, as expected from the 58% mortgage market decline. EWS had another strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 4 million records added to the TWN database, ending the quarter with 156 million current records, up 15%; and 117 million unique records, which was up 12%. This is a very positive sign, as historically, the first quarter has lower net record growth as large retail and logistics companies reduce elevated holiday season staffing in the first quarter.\nAnd as a reminder, unique records represent individuals on the TWN database and current records represent current active jobs in the database. And in our case, we have almost 50 million individuals having more than one job in our dataset. The 117 million unique individuals on TWN deliver high hit rates, including self-employed or 1099 employees and defined benefit pensioners. We now cover just over 50% of the 220 million people in the U.S. with employment and income records that are relevant to the TWN database and our customers.\nAs I referenced last quarter, we're also beginning to onboard pension records with records from one major pension administrator, and discussions with many more. And through our cloud tech transformation, we're executing, expanding our capabilities to ingest unique 1099-based self-employment records.\nAnd as a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers from our Employer Services business relationships. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. And during the quarter, we signed agreements with 3 new payroll processors that will deliver records during the balance of 2023.\nAnd the TWN U.S. database now has 618 million total current and historical records from over 2.7 million employers. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporated current and historical records with about 50% of first quarter Verification Services revenue coming from products that include historical or trended records.\nMortgage revenue was down 38% in the quarter, which was in line with our February guidance, but outperformed the overall market by 20 points when compared to the 58% decline in originations. These are very strong results when compared to EWS' 52% outperformance in the first quarter last year.\nIn addition to strong record growth and the positive impact from price actions in the quarter, we also saw strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of our new Mortgage 36 solution, which is a 36-month trended product. During the quarter, over 50% of TWN mortgage inquiries were for products including trended or historical information, and all at higher price points.\nTurning to Slide 7. Workforce delivered revenue of $596 million, down 8% and in line with our expectations. Verification Services revenue of $456 million was down 11%, driven by the decline in mortgage revenue that I just referenced. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which now represents about 2/3 of Verifier revenue, delivered strong 16% growth in the quarter.\nWe saw continued very strong growth in the Government vertical, which is about 45% of Verifier non-mortgage revenue, with revenue up 33%, driven by strong growth with CMS at the state level, new products and record additions. We expect this strong growth in our Government vertical to continue throughout the year.\nTalent Solutions delivered strong 10% growth in the quarter despite the 6% decline in the overall hiring market. Talent Solutions' volumes have remained consistent since the middle of the fourth quarter despite the declining hiring market. We outgrew the market decline by over 15 percentage points, delivering 10% growth, a very strong performance, driven by continued penetration of our digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and favorable pricing.\nIn the quarter, we launched new products targeted to staffing and hourly segments designed to meet specific needs of background screeners and end market employers in these very high-volume market segments. We're also seeing continued penetration of our new educational background solutions. We expect these new products to continue to drive talent growth throughout 2023.\nConsumer lending was down 1% in the quarter due to lower auto volumes with financial institutions and P loan declines with fintech lenders.\nAnd Employer Services revenue of $141 million was up 4% from growth in our I-9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact in U.S. hiring, offset by a 9% decline in UC, or unemployment claims, driven by lower jobless claims. Despite the slowdown in hiring, we've not seen an increase in U.S. -- UC transactions yet. And as a reminder, first quarter Employer Services revenues are seasonally higher than other quarters due to higher Affordable Care Act and W-2 volumes.\nLast month, Workforce Solutions launched the PeopleHQ portal, a new cloud-native solution that brings together multiple best-in-class employer compliance services in a single unified online experience. PeopleHQ serves employers of all sizes and supports the total employee journey with enhanced and connected people-first experience, leveraging the full suite of EWS Employer Solutions.\nPowered by the Equifax Cloud and leveraging industry-leading security measures, the PeopleHQ portal will house several EWS services, including the work number verification service; I-9 HQ, including I-9 Anywhere and I-9 Inspect; and ACA HQ, with best-in-class Affordable Care Act capabilities that help employers meet the needs of their employees while also reducing risk for penalties.\nPeopleHQ is another example of how EWS is leveraging our new cloud-native capabilities to deliver new solutions to the market that will drive employer revenue and continued direct record growth.\nWorkforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margins of 50.4% were up 370 basis points from the fourth quarter and in line with our February guidance, and as expected, above 50% due to first quarter record growth, new product introductions and pricing actions more than offsetting the macro effect of lower volumes in mortgage and Talent Solutions as well as the negative mix from seasonally higher Employer Services revenues.\nThe strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data and Employer Services businesses were clear again in the quarter. Rudy and the EWS team delivered another strong quarter, outperforming the mortgage and hiring markets and continued strong record growth that will drive revenue and margins in the future.\nTurning to Slide 8. USIS revenue of $422 million was down about 2.5% and much better than our expectations due to stronger mortgage and non-mortgage performance. USIS mortgage revenue was down 25% and was better than our expectations. Although estimated mortgage originations were 300 basis points weaker than our expectation at down an estimated 58%, USIS credit inquiries were stronger than we expected at down 44%. Credit inquiry performance continues to outperform originations, reflecting higher relative levels of consumer mortgage shopping behavior in this higher interest rate environment.\nRevenue outperformance relative to credit inquiries was strong at 19%, driven principally by pricing actions, and was also strong versus estimated originations at 33%. At $105 million, our mortgage revenue was about 25% of total USIS revenue in the quarter.\nTotal non-mortgage revenue of $317 million was up 8% in the quarter with organic growth of about 4%. The 8% growth was stronger than the mid-single-digit growth that we expected in our February guidance.\nB2B non-mortgage revenue of $261 million, which represented over 60% of total USIS revenue, was up 8%, with organic revenue growth of about 3%. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up 9% total and up over 3% organically. And during the quarter, online revenue had very strong double-digit growth in commercial, auto, identity and fraud and insurance. And banking was up slightly in the quarter with growth at large financial institutions, although at slower pace than in the fourth quarter, more than offset by declines in -- with smaller financial institutions and fintechs.\nCommercial was up over 20% with continued strong growth from our differentiated commercial credit data, including financial telco utility and industry trade lines and our new OneScore for commercial that we launched in the first quarter. Commercial is an increasing area of strength, delivering above-market growth in the risk segment, and we should see continued strong performance as we complete their data and cloud transformation later this year.\nFinancial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business, returned to growth with revenue of $48 million that was up 4% and in line with our expectations. Revenue growth in offline fraud insights and IXI wealth products was partially offset by lower prescreen marketing revenue. Prescreen revenue from larger customers slowed growth in the quarter, but we saw significant weakness from smaller FIs and fintechs, and we have not seen an increase in risk-based portfolio reviews yet.\nUSIS consumer solutions business had revenue of $56 million in the first quarter, up 8%, from very good performances in our consumer direct and indirect channels. USIS is winning in the marketplace with strong momentum from new solutions and differentiated data in key verticals of identity and fraud, commercial and auto. We're also in active dialogues with U.S. customers about the competitive benefits of the Equifax Cloud with always-on stability, faster data transmission and Equifax Cloud-enabled new solutions. USIS is on offense as they finalize their cloud transformation and are pivoting to selling cloud-enabled -- new cloud-enabled solutions.\nUSIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.6% in the quarter and in line with our expectations. EBITDA margins were down sequentially due to negative mix from seasonally sequential growth in Mortgage Solutions, which drives higher royalties and data costs; as well as the normalization of annual employee incentive costs. USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to the new Equifax Cloud that are accelerating as we move through 2023. We expect USIS adjusted EBITDA margins to be about 34% in the second quarter, up sequentially, reflecting revenue growth and the accelerating benefit of our 2023 spending reduction plan.\nLast month, we announced Todd Horvath, joined Equifax as our USIS President. Todd has a proven track record of leading enterprise teams in financial services to drive growth and strong commercial relationship. And he brings more than 20 years of financial services management experience, a commitment to driving product and operational excellence and strong expertise in enterprise and cloud technologies, to his role as the USIS President. I'm energized to welcome Todd to the Equifax leadership team, and believe that his experience in transformation, innovation and customer experience will prove invaluable to taking USIS to the next tier.\nTurning to Slide 9. International revenue was $284 million in the quarter, up 9% in constant currency and 8% organically, and much better than our expectations, from new products and pricing actions. We're seeing a broad-based execution from Lisa and our international team. Europe local currency revenue was down 4%, but stronger than expected. The decline was due to the expected 20% decline in our debt management business in the U.K.\nAs we discussed last year, our U.K. debt management business was very strong in the first half of 2022 as the U.K. government made large catch-up debt placements following their COVID debt collection moratoriums. As a result, we expect to see declines in that business in the first half of 2022 (sic) [ 2023 ]. However, we do expect to see consistent sequential growth in our debt management business as we move through 2023. In the quarter, we secured an expanded budget allocation from the U.K. government, which will deliver higher volumes of debt placements during the year, and we expect debt management to return to revenue growth later this year.\nOur U.K. and Spain CRA business revenue was up 7% in the quarter, a very good performance and stronger than we expected. This strong performance was principally due to strong growth from consumer decisioning and analytical solutions.\nAsia Pacific delivered very strong local currency revenue growth of 11%, in which, Australia delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter. And we also saw a very strong growth in our India business, up over 40%.\nLatin America local currency revenue was up a very strong 32% driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth for the Latin American team, which we expect to continue in 2023.\nCanada local currency revenue was up 8% and above our expectations. Growth in consumer and identity and fraud was offset partially by lower mortgage volumes in Canada.\nAnd International adjusted EBITDA margins at 23.5% were better than our expectations due to the stronger revenue growth and good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans.\nTurning to Slide 10. New product introductions leveraging our differentiated data in the new Equifax Cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. Building off the momentum from 2022, where we launched over 100 new products and delivered a record Vitality Index of over 13%, in the first quarter, we launched over 30 new products and delivered 13% vitality again. Our first quarter Vitality Index was again led by very strong performance in Workforce Solutions and in Latin America. And in the quarter, over 80% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud.\nLeveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver Vitality Index in 2023 at about 13%, which is well above our 10% long-term Vitality Index goal. This equates to over $700 million of revenue from new products introduced in the past 3 years during 2023. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new Equifax Cloud capabilities and Single Data Fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and are driving Equifax top line growth and margins.\nOn the right side of the slide, we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. Leveraging our differentiated data, USIS launched OneScore, a new consumer credit scoring model that combines traditional Equifax credit history with telecommunications, pay TV and utility payment data on over 191 million consumers, as well as Equifax DataX and Teletrack specialty finance data on about 80 million consumers, including payment history from nontraditional banks and lenders, which will potentially increase credit scores by up to 25 points and the score-able population by more than 20%. These new solutions are testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud in driving innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities for them.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter guidance. We're off to a strong start in 2023 building off the momentum from a strong 2022 non-mortgage growth, from new products, record growth and pricing. John?\n\nJohn W. Gamble\n\nChief Financial Officer & Vice President, Equifax, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before I discuss 2023, I'll share a little more detail on first quarter '23. First quarter corporate expense at $146 million was above our expectations, principally due to higher variable compensation with our strong first quarter results and costs related to executing the broader restructuring related to the $200 million spending reduction program.\nItems below operating income came in as we expected, with interest expense of $58 million; depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related amortization, of $89 million; and a tax rate of about 26.1%.\nCapital spending in the quarter was about $154 million and in line with our expectations. We expect capital spending in the second quarter to remain at levels similar to 1Q '23 and then sequentially decline in the third and fourth quarters as we complete significant U.S. and Canadian customer migrations to Data Fabric. Total capital spending in 2023 is expected to be $545 million. CapEx as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below.\nAs Mark mentioned, first quarter mortgage market originations were estimated by MBA at down almost 58%, which is about 300 basis points weaker than the down 55% for the first quarter that we discussed in February. As shown on Slide 11, however, first quarter credit inquiries were down 44%, better than our February expectations. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate did decline from a high of 6.5% in the quarter to about 6.3% today. It appears the somewhat lower rates attracted people to begin the home-buying process, but continued tight inventory and high home prices limited closings and originations.\nAs we look for the rest of 2023, our planning does not assume a fundamental improvement in the mortgage or housing markets. We're applying normal seasonal patterns to the current run rate of credit and TWN inquiries that we are seeing in late March and early April. On that basis, for 2023, we are expecting mortgage market originations to decline about 32% versus 2022 or about a 200 basis point greater decline than we discussed in February.\nAs we have discussed in the past, TWN inquiries are closely linked to originations. USIS credit inquiries, despite the weaker overall originations market, should still be down about 30% versus 2022 due to the better-than-expected credit inquiries in the first quarter and the expectation of continued greater-than-normal mortgage shopping that does not move to an origination.\nLooking at the second quarter, again, applying seasonal patterns to the run rates we're seeing in late March and early April, mortgage market originations are assumed to be down about 38% and credit inquiries down about 33%.\nAs we discussed in February, sequentially, as we move through the second half of 2023, a more normal pattern of mortgage activity would have mortgage originations in 3Q '23 being about flat with 2Q '23 and then declining in 4Q '23 versus 3Q '23. We expect that with the sequential patterns and the weaker overall originations in 2023 than we discussed in February, u.S. mortgage originations would be down slightly in the second half versus the first half and 4Q '23 would be about flat year-to-year.\nTurning to Slide 12. As Mark referenced earlier, in the first quarter, we outperformed on revenue delivery and delivered well against our 2023 spending reduction plan that will deliver $200 million in spending reduction in 2023 versus 2022 levels, including workforce reduction, closure of data centers and additional cost control measures.\nIn the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins were slightly stronger than expected at 29.2%. Adjusted for the negative timing of the impact of higher stock-based compensation in the quarter versus fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been about 31%.\nFor 2Q, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approaching 32.5% at the midpoint of our guidance range. This sequential margin expansion is driven by both revenue growth as well as acceleration of the savings in the second half of '23 related to our $200 million spending reduction plan. As revenue grows sequentially in the second half of '23 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improve sequentially, with EBITDA margins expected to exceed 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter.\nSlide 13 provides our guidance for the second quarter of '23. In 2Q '23, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.31 billion and $1.33 billion with non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 8%, partially offset by mortgage revenue declines moderating to about down 14% compared to down 33% in the first quarter. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by just over 100 basis points.\n2Q '23 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to approach 32.5%, up over 300 basis points sequentially, given revenue growth, the 2023 cost actions and lower equity compensation expense. Overall, the EBITDA margins in total are expected to be up sequentially from 1Q '23 driven by Workforce delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of over 51% in the quarter as well as margin improvement in USIS from revenue growth and cost actions. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully sequentially in 2Q '23 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in the first quarter.\nBusiness unit performance in the second quarter are expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be down about 1%, negatively impacted by the expected about 38% decline in mortgage market originations. Non-mortgage revenue will be up single digits, overcoming year-over-year declines in U.S. hiring and customer-specific weakness in consumer lending. We expect EWS non-mortgage growth to reaccelerate to double digits in the third and fourth quarters. EBITDA margins are expected to be up -- are expected to be over 51%, up over 100 basis points sequentially, driven by sequential revenue growth and strong execution of 2023 cost actions. Workforce Solutions will represent just under 50% of Equifax revenue in the quarter.\nUSIS revenue is expected to be up about 3% year-to-year. Non-mortgage revenue growth should be approximately at the level similar to the 8% we delivered in the first quarter, partially offset by a decline in mortgage revenue due to the expected 33% decline in mortgage credit inquiries. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34%, up sequentially due to revenue growth and strong execution on cost actions.\nInternational revenue is expected to be up about 6% in constant currency, with EBITDA margins expected to be about 23%.\nTotal non-mortgage constant currency growth of 7% to 8% is down from the 10% we delivered in the first quarter. We do expect to return to 10%-plus growth in 3Q and 4Q, principally driven by accelerating growth in EWS as well as stronger growth in International. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q '23 to be $1.60 to $1.70 per share.\nSlide 14 provides the specifics of our 2023 full year guidance. As Mark mentioned, we are maintaining our full year guidance despite the expected weaker U.S. mortgage originations and a more negative impact of foreign exchange. We expect total mortgage revenue to be down year-to-year at similar levels to our February guidance at down 8%, or slightly more negative.\nAs we discussed, we expect mortgage originations will be down 32% versus the down 30% we discussed in February. We do not expect this to impact USIS mortgage revenue as we are seeing higher levels of shopping, which offset the decline in originations. In EWS, we expect an improved mix of higher-value trended mortgage solutions to partially mitigate the impact of the originations decline.\nFor non-mortgage constant currency revenue, we continue to expect constant currency growth at about the levels we discussed in February at up 8% or slightly better given our strong performance in NPI and stronger growth in International. These levels of growth, the strong start we had to the year, execution in NPI, delivery of our 2023 spending reductions and cloud transformation plans, allow us to deliver to our guidance despite the more negative impact of FX. We believe that our full year guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS ranges.\nAs we discussed in February, we remain focused on delivering our midterm goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins. Market conditions are significantly different than we first discussed in November of 2021, our goal of achieving these goals in 2025. The U.S. mortgage market is expected, in 2023, to be down about 40% from the normal 2015 to '19 average levels we had discussed to deliver $7 billion in revenue in 2025. Our core organic revenue has grown over 300 basis points faster than we discussed with you in November of 2021. However, a recovery in the mortgage market from the levels we are seeing in 2023, around the order of 2/3 of the lost volume, is still likely needed to achieve our $7 billion goal.\nWe are focused on driving above-market growth and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed with our 2023 and 2024 spending reduction plans, and as part of our data and technology cloud transformation, which are needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins as we exceed the $7 billion revenue level. We will continue to discuss with you our progress toward our $7 billion goal as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward.\nNow I would like to turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Equifax, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 15. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with above-market performance, delivering strong 10% non-mortgage constant currency dollar revenue growth, reflecting the breadth and depth of the Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities.\nAt the business unit level. Workforce Solutions had another strong quarter, powering our results, delivering 11% non-mortgage revenue growth with adjusted EBITDA margins of 50%. As I mentioned earlier, EWS signed 3 new payroll processors, and with our TWN current records reaching 156 million, up 4 million records sequentially and up 15% versus last year. Workforce delivered another very strong quarter with the Vitality Index over 20% from innovative new products and solutions, leveraging the new EFX Cloud while further penetrating the high-growth Talent and Government verticals.\nUSIS continued their momentum from the fourth quarter, with B2B non-mortgage growth of 8% total and 3% organic in the quarter, driven by online B2B non-mortgage growth of 9% total and 3% organic as they accelerate customer migrations to their new Equifax Cloud.\nInternational delivered strong 9% local currency growth, with strong growth in LatAm, Australia, Canada, India and our European credit businesses.\nAnd our first quarter Vitality Index of 13% continues to be well above our 10% long-term NPI framework as we delivered over 30 new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud in the quarter.\nAnd we made significant progress executing against our EFX Cloud data and technology transformation with over 70% of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. And we're laser-focused on completing our North America migration this year to become the only cloud-native data analytics company.\nAnd we're executing against our spending reduction plans that will deliver $200 million of savings in 2023 with run rate savings of over $250 million in 2024 that will expand our margins to 36% and EPS to over $2 per share as we exit the year, which positions us for an uncertain economic environment while reducing the capital intensity of our business.\nAnd as mentioned earlier, given our strong performance in the quarter, our ability to continue to outperform our underlying markets and deliver on our planned 2023 spending reductions, we've reaffirmed our 2023 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS.\nWe're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the Equifax Cloud over the past 4 years to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We're energized by the early benefits of the Equifax Cloud. We're delivering on the cost benefits we outlined 4 years ago, and you're seeing our margins expand. The competitive benefits of being always-on with faster data transmission and digital macro are positioning us for share gains.\nThe power of a Single Data Fabric, where all our data has moved from siloed environments to a single data environment, is allowing us to deliver unique solutions, like our new mortgage credit report, leveraging [ NCplus ] data; OneScore, leveraging all of our alternative data; and a wide array of trended solutions, leveraging our historical data.\nNPIs leveraging our differentiated data and cloud capabilities are accelerating and well above our 10% long-term vitality goal with over 13% vitality last year and 13% in the first quarter. Even more encouraging is Workforce Solutions' NPI results, who completed most of their cloud work early last year, and is delivering over 20% vitality in 2023.\nThis is an exciting time for Equifax, and I'm energized about our strong above-market performance, but even more energized about the new Equifax in 2023 and beyond. We're convinced that our new Equifax Cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets in our new Single Data Fabric and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and higher free cash flow in the future.\nAnd with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Head of Equifax Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nTrevor Burns\n\nSVP of Corporate IR, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com.\nDuring the call today, I'll be making reference to materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q4 2022 earnings conference call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full year 2023 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nWe'll also be making certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS for Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the financial results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website.\nIn the fourth quarter, Equifax incurred a restructuring charge of $24 million or $0.15 a share. This charge was for a cause principally incurred to reduce headcount in 2023 as we realign our business functions ahead of completing our technology transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mark on Slide 4.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another very strong quarter to close out 2022 with continuing execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. Fourth quarter reported revenue of $1.2 billion was down about 4.5% and down 4% on an organic constant currency basis, both as expected, against an unprecedented mortgage market decline, but above the high end of our October guidance from broad-based strength across Equifax and stronger NPI rollouts. Fourth quarter adjusted Equifax EBITDA totaled $371 million with an EBITDA margin of 31%. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 per share was at the upper end of our October guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, and John will provide more detail in a few minutes.\nEquifax U.S. mortgage revenue was down 41% in the quarter but outperformed the overall market by 27 percentage points, with estimated U.S. mortgage originations down 68%. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 84% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, were very strong, with 12% constant currency and 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, stronger than we expected when we provided guidance in October and at the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. This strong growth was driven again by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions with 17% non-mortgage revenue growth overall and 23% non-mortgage revenue growth in Verifier.\nAs I'll discuss more later, Government continued very strong in Workforce Solutions with growth at over 40%, and Talent and I-9 boarding delivered over 20% growth but were impacted by slowing U.S. hiring in November and December. Delivering 20% growth in that vertical against a slowing hiring market was a very strong performance. And second, USIS non-mortgage had an outstanding quarter, delivering very strong double-digit B2B non-mortgage growth of 10% total and 19% online, which was much better than our expectations. And last, International delivered another strong quarter with 9% constant dollar and 8% organic constant dollar growth, led by very strong performance in Latin America.\nWe continue to make strong progress against the final chapter of our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in 2022. Currently, about 70% of North American revenue is delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. During 2022, we made the decision to increase capital spending by approximately $175 million to a total of $625 million to accelerate the completion of our North American cloud transformation.\nThe progress made in 2022 will enable the substantial completion of North America transformation and customer migrations this year, including decommissioning of applications in our major North America data centers. Capital spending will decline significantly in 2023 due to the strong progress at completing the cloud last year. Our new EFX Cloud infrastructure is delivering always-on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated data sets, faster data delivery and industry-leading enterprise-level security. We're convinced that our EFX Cloud and Single Data Fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come.\nNew product innovation is also executing at a very high level. Our new product Vitality Index of 14% in the quarter is a record and a 500 basis point improvement from the 9% Vitality Index last year and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term new product vitality goal. Our focus on new solutions, leveraging the new Equifax Cloud, is paying off. As a reminder, our Vitality Index is the percentage of Equifax revenue from new products launched in the past 3 years.\nAs our fourth quarter performance highlights, we continue to execute very well, driving strong non-mortgage growth across Equifax and record levels of new product revenue. In addition to accelerating long-term revenue growth, 2 critical goals of our EFX 2025 strategic framework are significant and consistent EBITDA margin expansion and the lowering of the capital intensity of our business to drive our free cash flow. In 2023, we are executing a broad operational restructuring across Equifax, reflecting both the acceleration of our cloud transformation and a broader focus on operational process improvements. We will reduce our total workforce of over 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10% during 2023 as well as delivering cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers as we complete the cloud and other broader spending controls. Total spending reductions from these actions in 2023 are expected to be about $200 million, with about $120 million reduction in expenses and an $80 million reduction in CapEx.\nI'll cover our 2023 plan in more detail shortly, but first, we'll provide more detail on our strong performance in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong non-mortgage performance with revenue growth up 12% in constant currency, led by EWS Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which was up 23%, led by Talent, which was up 19% and Government up 43%; EWS, I-9 and onboarding, which was up over 40%; USIS B2B online mortgage was up almost 20%; and Latin America was up over 30%, all very strong performances. Fourth quarter constant dollar non-mortgage growth of 12% was at the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue framework despite some slowdown in the U.S. hiring activity impacting our Workforce Solutions Talent vertical. Non-mortgage revenue growth continues to be very strong across Equifax.\nTurning to Slide 6. Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter. Mortgage revenue outperformed the overall mortgage market as measured by originations by about 30% in the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year. And Verifier non-mortgage revenue was again very strong, with organic growth of 23% in the quarter and 40% for the total year. During 2022, we signed 10 new agreements with U.S. payroll processors, including 4 in the quarter that will be added to the TWN database during 2023. Recently, we also signed a substantial direct relationship that added over 2 million new TWN records. These new partnerships, along with continued growth in existing partner records and the new direct contributors through our Employer Services business, are delivering continuing strong growth in our TWN database, with current records up 6 million records sequentially, reaching 142 million records -- 152 million records, with 114 million unique and over 600 million total current historical records from over 2.6 million employers.\nIndustry-leading data security and operational processes as well as our ability to provide substantial value to our direct contributors and revenue share to our payroll partners are delivering exceptional record growth for Workforce Solutions. 114 million unique individuals in TWN deliver high hit rates and represent almost 70% of the 165 million U.S. nonfarm payroll. Adding gig and pension records, we have the ability to almost double our TWN records in the future, which is a big driver of EWS revenue and margins. As a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers, with the remaining contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies.\nWorkforce Solutions also continues to lead Equifax and new products, delivering a Vitality Index at over 2x our long-term 10% vitality goal, which is a great proof point for the power of the Equifax Cloud to drive innovation in new products. Workforce Solutions Vitality Index has expanded from low single digits a short 4 years ago to over 20% vitality in 2022. Workforce Solutions, as you know, was the first Equifax business to be substantially complete with their cloud transformation over a year ago, allowing the team to fully focus on innovation and NPIs, leveraging their new cloud capabilities. The Work Number is also seeing accelerated expansion outside the United States in the U.K., Canada and Australia. In January, Workforce Solutions signed an agreement with a leading U.K. payroll technology partner, obtaining access to over 40% of U.K. private sector employees. Workforce Solutions now has access to over 20 million active and historical records in Australia, Canada and the U.K. in addition to over 40 million active and historical alternative income records, including pension data and tax returns.\nTurning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions delivered revenue of $508 million, down 4% in the fourth quarter. Revenue was slightly weaker than expected driven by slower growth in talent and onboarding businesses from declines we saw in U.S. hiring in November and December. Verification Services revenue of $399 million was down 7%, driven by the unprecedented 68% decline in U.S. mortgage originations. As mentioned earlier, EWS mortgage revenue outperformed the overall market by a very strong 30 percentage points, driven by strong TWN record additions, penetration, pricing and new product revenue growth with the strong adoption of our new mortgage 36 solution that was rolled out late last year.\nVerification Services non-mortgage revenue, which now represents almost 70% of Verifier revenue, delivered strong 23% growth in the quarter. We saw continued very strong 43% growth in the Government vertical, which is almost 45% of Verifier non-mortgage revenue, driven by strong growth in our Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services volumes. The EWS government vertical is benefiting from penetration, pricing, record growth and leveraging a strong new product portfolio, including our new insights data at the federal state and local level. We expect to continue this strong growth in our government vertical in 2023 in a big $2 billion TAM.\nTalent Solutions delivered strong 19% growth in the quarter despite the impact of the weakening overall hiring, which is estimated to be down about 8% in the quarter. We outgrew this market decline by over 25 percentage points and delivered 19% growth, a very strong performance driven by continued penetration of our digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and favorable pricing. In the first quarter, we will launch new products in the talent space targeted at the staffing and hourly segments designed to meet specific needs of background screeners in these high-volume segments, which will drive Talent growth.\nEmployer Services revenue of $110 million was up 4.5% in the quarter due to strong growth in our I-9, onboarding and healthy FX businesses, which were up 17%. Our I-9 and onboarding businesses remained strong at 20% growth but were also negatively impacted by the declines in U.S. hiring late in 2022. Our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses were down 11%, driven by lower jobless claims and lower ERC transactions as the COVID federal tax program expires. Despite the slowdown in hiring, we have not seen a meaningful increase in UC transactions yet.\nWorkforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 46.8% were lower than our October guidance, principally due to lower revenue growth in talent and onboarding related to the slowdown in U.S. hiring. We expect EWS margins to return to about 50% in the first quarter and will be above 50% for all of 2023. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in 2022. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter, outperforming the mortgage originations by 30 points and delivering strong 17% non-mortgage revenue growth. EWS is expected to deliver a strong 2023 and continue above market growth in the future.\nAs shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue of $406 million was down 6.5% and slightly better than our expectations. USIS mortgage revenue was down about 46% and was in line with our expectations against an unprecedented 54% decline in credit inquiries compared to the 50-plus percent in our October guidance -- 50-plus percent decline that we had in our October guidance. Revenue outperformance relative to credit inquiries was strong at 8%, driven by favorable new mortgage business penetration, new mortgage products and new mortgage pricing. Credit inquiry performance continues to be less negative than estimated originations, reflecting higher relative levels of mortgage shopping behavior that we talked about before. At $67 million, mortgage revenue is now about 15% of total USIS revenue.\nB2B non-mortgage revenue of $280 million -- $288 million, which represents over 70% of total USIS revenue, was up 10%, with organic revenue growth of about 6.5%. This was a significant sequential increase and much stronger than the levels we expected in October. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was very strong at up 19% total and up over 13% organically, reflecting pricing and product rollouts as well as stronger volumes in banking as lenders continue to drive new originations. During the quarter, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in commercial, identity and fraud, and auto, with banking at just under 10% growth.\nFinancial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business, had revenue of $72 million that was down 9% and slightly above our expectations. As we discussed during the year, we expect FMS to return to growth in 2023 with revenue up low single digits in the first quarter. USIS Consumer Solutions business had revenue of $50 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% from penetration and new product introductions. In 2023, we expect low single-digit growth from our U.S. consumer direct business. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 35.3% in the quarter, up 120 basis points sequentially due to very strong double-digit B2B online non-mortgage revenue growth. EBITDA margins were down 400 basis points compared to prior year due to declines in high-margin mortgage revenue.\nInternational revenue, as shown on Slide 9, was $284 million, up a strong 9% in constant currency and 8% organically. We're seeing broad-based execution from our international businesses, with particular strength in Latin America NPI rollouts. Europe local currency revenue was up 3%, principally driven by 9% growth in our debt management business. We continue to see strong debt placements from the U.K. government, as we have over the past several quarters. Our U.K. and Spain CRA business revenue was about flat in the fourth quarter and below our expectations, principally due to lower new business penetration. Asia Pacific, which is our Australia business, delivered local currency revenue of 6%, driven by growth in our commercial, consumer, identity and fraud, and HR identification businesses. Latin America local currency revenue was up a strong 31% driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth for the Latin American team. Canada local currency revenue was up 7% and above our expectations. Growth in consumer, commercial, analytical solutions and identity and fraud revenue were partially offset by mortgage volume declines and lower direct-to-consumer revenue.\nInternational adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.8% were down 100 basis points sequentially and below our expectations due to a greater mix of lower-margin debt services revenue and higher costs principally from purchase data.\nTurning to Slide 10. 2022 was an outstanding year for new product innovation, and as you know, NPIs are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. We delivered over 100 new products for the third year in a row and a record full year Vitality Index of over 13% and a fourth quarter Vitality Index of 14%. The 13% Vitality Index in 2022 was up over 400 basis points above our strong 2021 results and over 300 basis points higher than our 10% long-term growth framework goal for new products and our vitality. New product revenue in 2022 was $650 million, up over 50% from about $420 million in 2021. And in 2022, over 90% of new product revenue was from non-mortgage products.\nLeveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index in 2023 at levels similar to the 13% we delivered in 2022, which is well above our 10% long-term NPI Vitality Index goal. And this equates to over $700 million of revenue in 2023 from new products introduced in the past 3 years. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new EFX Cloud capabilities and Single Data Fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and are driving Equifax top line growth and margins.\nTurning to Slide 11. 2022 was also a strong year for bolt-on acquisitions as we continue to focus on our strategic M&A priorities and growing our non-mortgage revenue. Since 2021, we've completed 13 acquisitions that are delivering $450 million of principally non-mortgage run rate revenue. Our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework includes 1 to 2 points of annual revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A aligned around our 3 strategic priorities: number one, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; number two, building out our identity and fraud capabilities; and number three, adding unique data assets. We expect these strategic acquisitions to deliver growth synergies in '23 and '24 as we complete their technology and product integrations.\nLast week, we announced the acquisition of the Food Industry Credit Bureau, a leading provider of credit information for the Canadian food industry with over 90% commercial data coverage. This acquisition expands our commercial product offerings in Canada. We also continue to work closely with the Board of Directors of Boa Vista Services, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil, on the proposed acquisition we announced in December. When completed, the BVS acquisition will add $160 million of run rate revenue in the fast-growing Brazilian market. The transaction is subject to Boa Vista shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. To the extent we're able to finalize terms with the Boa Vista Board, we expect the transaction to close in mid-2023.\nTurning to 2023 guidance on Slide 12. We ended the year with significant momentum in the underlying growth of our businesses and in the execution of our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. However, we also entered 2023 with a continuing decline in the mortgage market and broader economic uncertainty impacting our underlying markets. Our assumption for U.S. mortgage market originations is a further decline of 30% in 2023, which is more than 30% below the lowest level of originations in the past 10 years. For perspective, MBA is currently forecasting 2023 origination units down about 22% versus our 30% assumption -- minus 30% assumption. Fannie and Freddie do not forecast units but are forecasting origination dollar volumes down 30% and 25%, respectively. In our planning, we've assumed the bulk of the mortgage declines in the first half, with first quarter originations down about 55%.\nSecondly, in 2022, we saw hiring freezes and headcount constraints impact our background screening volume in November and December, and we expect these conditions to continue in 2023 with hiring down over 10%, impacting our Talent Solutions and I-9 employee onboarding businesses. Even with these market impacts or market declines, we expect both businesses to grow over 10%.\nFinally, in our planning, we're expecting to see weakening in our key markets in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Canada (sic) [Australia] in 2023. We're assuming slowing growth in the U.S. as we move through the year, although at this point, we have not assumed a U.S. recession. Similarly, we are expecting to see economic slowdowns in Australia and Canada with perhaps a more significant slowdown in the U.K. The slow growth in these markets compares to the 2% to 2.5% underlying economic growth we assume in our long-term growth model.\nAs we enter 2023, we have strong underlying growth across our businesses with execution of our EFX 2025 growth strategies. Despite the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market and slower economic growth across our major markets, we expect to deliver revenue growth at the midpoint of 4% in 2023. Total mortgage revenue should decline about 8%, over 20 points better than the 30% reduction in mortgage originations; and non-mortgage revenue should grow over 8%, which is within our long-term growth framework despite the slower economic growth in our major markets.\nWe expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth of about 6% in 2023. This reflects a mortgage revenue decline of about 8% or over 20 points stronger than the expected 30% decline in mortgage originations. EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow about 13%, overcoming the expected 10% plus decline in U.S. hiring and about 15% decline in our ERC businesses as that COVID program winds down. TWN record growth, strong new product rollouts and continued strong growth in both pricing and penetration will continue to drive Workforce Solutions outperformance.\nWe expect USIS to deliver revenue growth of about 2% this year. Mortgage revenue is expected to decline about 7%, more than 20% -- 20 points stronger than the expected 30% decline in mortgage originations. In 2023, USIS will begin to benefit from their new mortgage credit file that was rolled out late last year that includes telecommunications, pay TV and utilities attributes to help streamline the mortgage underwriting process and support loans with the secondary mortgage market. Equifax is the first and only in the industry to provide these insights, which will be available to Equifax customers in the first quarter and can help create greater home opportunities for consumers across the U.S. We're also seeing the impact of pricing increases from one of our largest mortgage vendors that we pass on to customers at levels to maintain consistent margins.\nNon-mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 5% despite the slowing growth. Non-mortgage revenue growth of about 5% will be driven by strong commercial, identity and fraud banking and auto growth. And Financial Marketing Services expect to return to growth in 2023 after a disappointing 2022.\nInternational had a very strong 2022 with revenue up 12% in constant dollars, but we saw some weakening end markets late in the year, particularly in debt services. We expect International growth of 5% in constant currency in 2023. This is below our long-term growth framework for International of 7% to 9%, principally due to the expected weakening economic conditions in our major markets of the U.K., Canada and Australia and also a decline in debt services off a very strong 2022. As we discussed last year, debt services revenue in 2022 was somewhat of a catch-up year as the U.K. government collections were put on hold during the COVID pandemic. We continue to expect international to operate within their 7% to 9% growth framework over the mid and long term. NPIs will again be very strong, which is -- and consistent with last year's 13% Vitality Index, well above our 10% long-term vitality goal, and this will be led by Workforce Solutions in Latin America. As USIS and Canada complete their cloud transformation, we expect their NPI rollouts to accelerate as we exit 2023.\nAs we complete our North American cloud transformation in 2023, we will pivot to leveraging our differentiated data assets and new cloud infrastructure to drive new product rollouts and top line growth. Workforce Solutions will accelerate its focus on leveraging their new cloud capabilities, and USIS in Canada will complete their consumer credit, alternative data and IFS transformations this year. These are big milestones in completing the cloud that we've been building towards for almost 5 years. We're on track to deliver the cost and capital spending reductions from the cloud transformation that are central to our long-term growth framework. As I referenced earlier and as shown on Slide 13, our accelerated cloud transformation cost reductions and broader cost restructuring will deliver $200 million of cost and CapEx savings in 2023 that will expand our margins and free cash flow in the future.\nDuring 2023, we plan to reduce our total workforce of about 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10%. As we complete our North American cloud transformation in 2023, we expect to close about 15 data centers, consolidate development centers and continue to reduce our software application footprint, and we'll closely manage discretionary spending, including professional services. We expect these actions to deliver $200 million in spending reductions in 2023, representing $120 million cost and expense reductions, or about $0.75 per share, and $80 million in capital spending reductions. The savings in the first quarter are limited and accelerate in the second quarter and through the second half of 2023. In 2024, the run rate benefit of these actions will reduce our spending by over $250 million. The lower cost and capital spending accelerates as we move through 2023 from cloud transformation cost benefits and other costs and restructuring actions planned throughout the year.\nAs shown on Slide 14, adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improved significantly as we moved through 2023. In the first quarter, revenue is expected to be down 6% due to the about 55% reduction in mortgage originations. EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS are at their lowest levels in 2023 in the first quarter, principally due to the higher incremental margins from the declining mortgage revenue and the timing of the recognition of the majority of our annual equity incentive plan expense in the quarter. Normalizing for this timing compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter EBITDA margins are slightly below fourth quarter margins of 31%. As revenue growth improves throughout 2023 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improve sequentially, with EBITDA margins expected to exceed 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, EBITDA will be up 4% or $70 million, in line with revenue growth, with margins flat to the 33.6% we delivered last year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be about $7.20 per share, down about 5% from 2022, principally reflecting higher depreciation and amortization of about $50 million as North American cloud system implementations principally completes, also from higher interest and other expense of about $60 million and a higher tax rate. Capital spending will decline by $65 million to about $545 million in the year or about 10% of revenue as we move closer to completing our cloud transportation. We expect CapEx to decline again in 2024.\nWe have a clear line of sight to executing these proactive actions that will expand our margins and drive our free cash flow. In addition to cost benefits, completing our North American cloud transformation will enable significant commercial benefits to drive market share and revenue growth, including our always-on capabilities, better data quality, faster data delivery and faster new product innovation. And we're beginning to see meaningful commercial benefits from our new Equifax Cloud technology transformation.\nAnd now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2023 assumptions and guidance and also provide our guidance for the first quarter. Our 2023 guidance builds on our strong 2022 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth, pricing and acquisition synergies. John?\n\nJohn W. Gamble\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & COO, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before we discuss 2023, I'll share a little more detail on 4Q 2022. As Mark referenced earlier, Equifax EBITDA margins came in slightly lower than expected in the fourth quarter at 31%, principally driven by lower-than-expected margins in Workforce Solutions, as Mark discussed, and also in International.\nCapital spending in the fourth quarter was $156 million as we maintained investments to accelerate completion of North American cloud transformation. Capital spending will decline in 1Q '22 to -- '23 to about $150 million and then sequentially further in each quarter of 2023 as we complete significant U.S. and Canadian customer migrations. Total capital spending in 2023 is expected to be about $545 million. CapEx as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below.\nMoving on to 2023 guidance. Mark provided an overview of our planning assumptions of a 30% reduction in mortgage originations in 2023. As shown on Slide 15, at these levels, and again, using credit inquiries as a proxy for the mortgage market, in 2023, the U.S. mortgage market will be substantially below any level we have seen in the past 10 years. 1Q '23 is expected to see the mortgage market down about 55% year-to-year. Sequentially, as we move through 2023, we're planning on a more normal pattern of mortgage activity with mortgage originations increasing sequentially on the order of 15% in 2Q '23 from 1Q '23, 3Q '23 being about flat with the second quarter, and normal sequential decline in the fourth quarter versus 3Q '23. We expect with these sequential patterns, U.S. mortgage originations would be up slightly in the second half of '23 versus the first half of '23, and the fourth quarter of '23 would be up slightly year-to-year. And at least the first half of 2023, we are expecting USIS to benefit from mortgage shopping behavior with better performance than originations.\nSlide 16 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 4% revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance of $5.325 billion. The 30% decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2023 total revenue growth by about 7 percentage points. The mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the mortgage market is expected to offset about 5 points of the negative 7 percentage points impact of the mortgage market on overall revenue growth. As a result, the expected 8% decline in Equifax mortgage revenue has a negative about 2 percentage point impact on overall revenue growth.\nNon-mortgage organic growth is expected to exceed 7% on a constant currency basis and is driving about 5% of the growth in overall Equifax revenue. As Mark referenced earlier, the growth is broad-based across all 3 BUs and is within our long-term framework of 7% to 10% despite the economic uncertainty across our major markets in the U.S., Australia, Canada and the U.K. The acquisitions completed in 2022 and year-to-date are expected to contribute about 1% of growth to 2023. For clarity, this does not include revenue from the potential acquisition of Boa Vista.\nSlide 17 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 5% decline to the midpoint of our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.20 per share. Revenue growth of 4% at our 2022 EBITDA margins of about 33.6% would deliver 5.5% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margins in 2023 are expected to be about flat from the 33.6% we delivered in 2022. In 2023, the cost actions we are taking are expected to deliver about $120 million of expense reductions. These cost benefits are being principally offset by several factors. First, in 2022, variable compensation, including incentive and sales comp, were at very low levels due to the substantial impact of the weak mortgage market on our performance. In 2023, our planning assumes we return to targeted levels of performance, and therefore, these compensation drivers. Royalties and costs for data and third-party scores are increasing as we continue to add new partners and broaden data sources.\nAlso in 2023, we are also still incurring a level of redundant system costs as we continue to operate legacy North American systems prior to their decommissioning later in 2023. As we look beyond 2023, the impact of variable compensation moving to target and the cost of redundant systems in North America are behind us, and therefore, the benefits of our cost actions as well as accelerating high variable profit revenue growth are expected to drive significant improvement in EBITDA margins.\nDepreciation and amortization is expected to increase by just over $50 million in 2023, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4%. D&A is increasing in '23 as we accelerate putting cloud native systems in production. The combined increase in interest expense, net other expense and tax expense in 2023 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by just over 6 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates and also the increased debt from our 2022 acquisitions. Our estimated tax rate of about 26% is up about 150 basis points from 2022 due to a higher mix of non-U.S. revenue and lower tax benefits as we reduce capital and development spending.\nSlide 18 provides the specifics of our 2022 full year guidance that Mark discussed in detail. The slide includes additional detail on expected BU EBITDA margins as well as guidance on specific P&L line items. EWS EBITDA margins in 2023 of 52% are expected to be up from the 51.3% delivered in 2022, given the strong non-mortgage revenue growth from new products, penetration and pricing and the benefits of the cost actions Mark discussed earlier. USIS EBITDA margins at over 35% are expected to be down from the 36.8% delivered in 2022. USIS is also benefiting from cost actions. However, revenue growth at 2%, again, due to the impact of the U.S. mortgage market decline, is resulting in the year-to-year margin decline. International EBITDA margins at 27% are expected to expand versus the 25.7% delivered in 2022, driven principally by pricing and the 2023 cost actions.\nCorporate expense, excluding depreciation and amortization, is increasing in 2023 relative to 2022 due to the increases in incentive and equity compensation from the lower levels incurred in 2022 that I referenced earlier. Corporate functions such as finance, legal, HR and others are reducing costs in 2023, consistent with our cost actions. We believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges.\nSlide 19 provides our guidance for 1Q '23. As Mark discussed earlier, 1Q '23 is expected to have the largest year-to-year decline in the U.S. mortgage market that we'll see in 2023 at down about 55% as we compare to the relatively strong mortgage market in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the strong expected non-mortgage constant currency growth of about 9%, we will see a decline in 1Q '23 revenue of about 6% at the midpoint of our guidance.\n1Q '23 EBITDA margins are expected to be about 29%, down about 200 basis points sequentially. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are up sequentially from 4Q 2022, driven by Workforce Solutions delivering about 50% EBITDA margins in the quarter, which offsets declines at USIS and International. The decline in EBITDA margins in 1Q '23 sequentially from 4Q 2022 is driven by higher corporate expense, specifically the higher incentive and equity compensation costs referenced earlier. The bulk of the expense related to our equity plans occurs in the first quarter and is reflected in corporate. Excluding the impact from the sequential increase in equity compensation expense, EBITDA margins are approaching flat sequentially at just under 31%.\nCorporate expenses will decrease meaningfully sequentially in 2Q '23 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in the first quarter. Revenue increases sequentially in 1Q '23 relative to 4Q 2022. We're not seeing the expected increase in EBITDA margin sequentially in the first quarter, driven by the same factors impacting all of 2023 that I referenced earlier and the fact that there is limited first quarter benefit related to our 2023 cost actions. In the second quarter of 2023, we will see both the benefit of reduced corporate expense and increased benefits from our 2023 cost action supporting growth in EBITDA margins.\nBusiness unit performance in the first quarter are expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be down about 8.5% year-to-year due to the about 55% decline in the mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue will continue to deliver double-digit growth. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 50%, up over 300 basis points sequentially, driven by sequential revenue growth from new product and pricing actions. Workforce Solutions will represent just under 50% of Equifax revenue in the quarter.\nUSIS revenue is expected to be down about 5.5% year-to-year, again, driven by the about 55% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. USIS credit inquiries are expected to somewhat outperform the overall mortgage market due to consumer shopping. The mortgage decline is partially offset by growth in non-mortgage expected to be up mid-single digits. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32%, down sequentially due to negative mix from growth in core mortgage and higher overall mortgage royalties as well as the normalization of incentive costs that I referenced earlier. USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to Data Fabric that are occurring principally in the first half of '23.\nInternational revenue is expected to be up about 5% in constant currency. The weakness relative to the strong 4Q '22 growth of about 9% is principally a decline in the U.K. debt management business as we are now comparing to the very strong 2022 revenue driven by catch-up in our U.K. government business in 2022 as the U.K. government suspended collections during the pandemic. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 22%, down sequentially due to seasonally lower revenue in Canada and U.K. CRA and normalization of incentive costs as well as higher data costs. We're expecting adjusted EPS in the first quarter of '23 to be about $1.30 to $1.40 per share.\nLooking forward, we remain focused on delivering our midterm goal of $7 billion of revenue with 39% EBITDA margins. Market conditions are significantly different than when we first discussed in November of '21 our goal of achieving these results in 2025. The U.S. mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down over 35% from the normal 2015 to '19 average levels we had discussed is expected to deliver $7 billion of revenue in 2025. Our core organic revenue has grown over 300 basis points faster than we discussed with you in November of '21. However, recovery in the mortgage market around the order of 2/3 of the lost volume is still likely needed to achieve our $7 billion goal in 2025.\nWe're focused on driving above-market growth, including through accretive acquisitions and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed as part of our data and technology cloud transformation and needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins. We'll continue to discuss with you our progress toward our $7 billion and 39% EBITDA margin goals as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 20. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter, with above-market growth in 2022, more than offsetting the significant 55% decline in the U.S. mortgage market originations. We delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of strong, above-market, double-digit core revenue growth and strong, double-digit 12% non-mortgage growth, reflecting the power of the EFX business model and our execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities.\nAt the business unit level, first, Workforce Solutions had another outstanding year, powering our results, delivering 14% revenue growth and strong organic non-mortgage growth of 24%. TWN current records reached $152 million, up 12%, and total records surpassed 600 million. Workforce also delivered a Vitality Index of over 20% from innovative new products and solutions, leveraging their cloud capabilities while further penetrating the high-growth Talent and Government verticals. USIS had a very strong finish to 2022 with fourth quarter non-mortgage growth of 10% total and 7% organic, driven by online non-mortgage growth of 19% total and 13% organic. The USIS team remains competitive and is winning in the marketplace. International delivered 12% local currency growth, their second consecutive year of double-digit growth.\nAnd our 2022 Vitality Index of 13% was a record as we delivered over 100 new products for the third consecutive year in a row. And since 2021, we've completed 13 strategic bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen Equifax and identity and fraud that we expect to deliver over $450 million of principally run rate revenue going forward. And sixth, we made significant progress in 2022 executing against our EFX cloud, data and technology transformation, with about 70% of North American revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. And we're laser-focused on completing our North American migration in 2023 to become the only cloud-native data analytics company.\nWe're in the early days of leveraging our new cloud capabilities but remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities and accelerate our top line. Our strong progress on the cloud allowed us to accelerate cost savings and launch a proactive restructuring across Equifax that will deliver $200 million of cost savings in 2023, that will expand our margins to 36% as we exit 2023 and position us for an uncertain economic environment.\nAs we look to 2023, we're committed to completing our North American data and technology transformation while delivering continued above-market revenue growth and a substantial and consistent EBITDA margin growth and a reduction in capital intensity that is a key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. As mentioned earlier, the cost actions that were taken in 2023 reducing our spending by $200 million this year and over $250 million in 2024 will expand our margins and position us for a more uncertain economic environment.\nI'm energized about our strong above-market performance in 2022 but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax in 2023 and beyond. We're convinced that our new EFX cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets that are now in our Single Data Fabric and our market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future.\nAnd with that, operator, let me open it up to questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nTrevor Burns\n\nSVP of Corporate IR, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com.\nDuring the call, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\nAlso, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environments. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nWe will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mark, beginning on Slide 4.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Trevor. Equifax delivered another very solid quarter with continued execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities in a challenging economic environment. Third quarter revenue of $1.244 billion was up 2% or 4% in constant currency and was above the high end of our guidance, driven by strong nonmortgage revenue growth in the quarter. This strong revenue performance was well above our July framework and delivered, despite a more negative FX environment than we expected, which had 200 basis points or $29 million was a $5 million or about 50 basis point greater headwind for FX than we expected when we put out July guidance.\nAdjusted EPS of $1.73 per share was also stronger than our July guidance. We are continuing to significantly outperform our underlying markets as we navigate the challenging economic environment and mortgage market decline. Our global nonmortgage businesses, which now represent over 78% of total Equifax revenue, were very strong with 20% total and 13% organic non-mortgage constant currency dollar revenue growth, stronger than we expected when we provided guidance in July and stronger than our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework.\nWe're now tracking to 20% nonmortgage constant dollar growth in 2022, which is up about 100 basis points from our July guidance. The outperformance was again led by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions that delivered 40% total and 20% organic non-mortgage revenue growth.\nUSIS B2B non-mortgage grew 9% online and 5% total, which is about consistent with the second quarter, but weaker than we expected. International delivered a record quarter, up a very strong 17% constant dollar growth and 15% organic constant dollar growth, well above our expectations.\nEquifax total mortgage revenue was down 30%, about as expected, and outperformed the underlying market decline by over 10 points from pricing, new twin records, penetration, system and system integrations and new products. The U.S. mortgage market, as expected, weakened substantially in the third quarter with originations estimated at down 50% in the quarter, which was about 9 points weaker than our July guidance.\nAs a reminder, Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue is more closely tied to originations. USIS mortgage credit inquiries were down 41% in the quarter and better than our expectations from increased shopping activity despite the weaker-than-expected mortgage originations. We're continuing to see higher-than-normal levels of shopping, which continued throughout the quarter and tends to benefit USIS credit file [pulls]. Combined, the negative mortgage market impact on Equifax was about as expected, as the more negative market impact from originations on EWS was offset by the less negative impact on USIS from increased shopping activity.\nWe saw a continued weakening of the mortgage market as we move through September into the first few weeks of October as mortgage rates continue to rise to their highest level since 2008. We now expect mortgage originations to decline over 60% in the fourth quarter versus our July framework of 48% and USIS credit inquiries to decline over 50% versus our July guidance of 46%. John will talk about our updated mortgage framework in a minute.\nThird quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $405 million and was flat compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.5% were slightly below our expectations for the quarter, principally due to higher sales and marketing expenses, driven by our outperformance in non-mortgage verticals. John will walk you through our margin performance in the third quarter and expectations for fourth quarter later in the presentation.\nWe continue to make significant progress executing the EFX cloud data and technology transformation. We're now approaching 70% of North America and 60% of total EFX revenue being delivered from the new EFX cloud. Our focus for the remainder of '22 and 2023 is accelerating full customer migrations in North America to enable decommissioning of our applications in data centers.\nOur new EFX cloud infrastructure is delivering always-on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated data sets, faster data delivery and industry-leading enterprise-level security. We're convinced that our EFX Cloud and single data fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come.\nWe're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud infrastructure in single data fabric and are seeing acceleration of innovation and new product rollouts. Our new Product Vitality Index of 14% in the quarter is a record and over 500 basis points improvement from our 9% Vitality Index last year and well above our 10% long-term goal for Vitality.\nAs a reminder, our Vitality Index is the percentage of revenue derived from new products launched in the past 3 years. Our strong momentum on NPI rollouts, leveraging the new EFX Cloud, allowed us to raise our full year Vitality Index outlook for 2022 for the second time this year from 11% to 13%, which is up 300 basis points from our long-term framework and from the framework we started earlier this year. This strong NPI performance gives us momentum into 2023 as most new products reached commercial maturity in years 2 and 3.\nIn third quarter, we continued to execute our bolt-on acquisition strategy, completing 2 acquisitions, LawLogix, which will further strengthen Workforce Solutions' onboarding and I-9 Solutions; and Midigator, which will strengthen Kount and broaden our identity and fraud franchise. These are our 11th and 12th bolt-on acquisitions since January 2021 and aligned with our M&A strategy to strengthen Workforce Solutions, our largest and fastest-growing business, add unique and differentiated data and expand in the fast-growing identity and fraud market.\nBolt-on acquisitions that broaden strength in Equifax are strong levers for future growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add 100 to 200 basis points annually to our revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A. Our guidance for 2022 revenue of just under $5.1 billion is essentially unchanged from the framework we provided in July. With third quarter revenue -- third quarter revenue was stronger than our July guidance by about $25 million, our current guidance reflects a decline in fourth quarter from our prior implied view by about $25 million from the weaker mortgage market in FX.\nThe continued weakening in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting fourth quarter revenue by about $45 million, and negative FX is impacting revenue in the fourth quarter by about $15 million. Partially offsetting the $60 million negative impact is stronger non-mortgage revenue and Workforce Solutions and International and the acquired revenue from LawLogix and Midigator.\nThe strong 20% constant dollar non-mortgage growth in 2022 gives us great momentum as we look to 2023 and a bottoming of the mortgage market in the coming quarters. Our guidance for adjusted EPS of $7.54 a share is down about $0.13 from the midpoint of our July guidance. As our third quarter adjusted EPS was about $0.08 per share stronger than our July guidance, this results in a reduction in the fourth quarter from our implied EPS of about $0.21 a share, about $33 million in pretax income.\nThe most significant drivers of this reduction in EPS are, first, the $45 million reduction in higher-margin fourth quarter mortgage revenue due to the weakening mortgage market, which more than drives this level of reduction in pretax income; and second, higher interest expense. These negative impacts were partially offset by stronger non-mortgage growth and the addition of acquisition-related non-mortgage revenue from LawLogix and Midigator. And again, John will provide details on fourth quarter and full year guidance shortly.\nWe were very pleased with our continued very strong constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth of 20% total and 13% organic, which is well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework, and our ability to outperform the underlying mortgage market, as shown by our third quarter results.\nTurning to Slide 5. A critical delivery of our strategic priorities is the continued expansion of our addressable market, data sources and revenue. Equifax is much more than a credit bureau today, and our addressable TAM has expanded 3x to over $45 billion. Over the past several years, we've expanded into faster-growing markets outside financial services and mortgage. These faster-growing markets include identity and fraud, talent management, government and employer services verticals. This has accelerated our growth outside of financial services and mortgage and increased the resiliency and diversity of EFX by broadening our revenue streams, including markets that are expected to deliver future growth at levels above our traditional markets.\nAs shown on the slide, since 2019, we've grown our total non-mortgage business by over $1.1 billion with a combined CAGR since 2019 of 12%, which is at the high end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. In 2022, we expect non-mortgage revenue to represent over 75% of total Equifax revenue. In the fourth quarter, it will be well over 80%.\nAlso since 2019, we've grown our noncredit bureau-based revenues by $1.5 billion, or a very strong CAGR of about 30%, to over half of Equifax total revenue. This is led by our $2.4 billion Workforce Solutions business, which is up $1.4 billion since 2019 at a very strong CAGR of about 35%, but also supported by strong double-digit growth in Identity & Fraud from Kount and Midigator as well as strong growth in debt services.\nWe've also completed 12 acquisitions since 2021 that are all in the non-mortgage space and are delivering strong double-digit growth. Workforce Solutions' strong above-market growth in verticals like employer solutions, talent and government, our expansion into identity and fraud and our focus on new product investments, coupled with our bolt-on acquisitions focused on non-mortgage priorities, will continue to accelerate the growth of these noncredit and non-mortgage revenue streams at Equifax.\nTurning to Slide 6. In third quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars, grew a very strong 16% reported and 19% in constant currency, which was consistent with our July guidance. Constant dollar core revenue -- organic revenue growth of 14% in the quarter was also substantially above the organic growth in our long-term financial framework of 7% to 10%. Non-mortgage constant dollar organic revenue growth of 13% drove 3/4 of the organic constant dollar core growth in the quarter.\nCore mortgage outperformance, predominantly in EWS, drove the remainder of organic constant dollar revenue growth. We continue to expect strong core revenue growth of 17% total and 19% in constant currency in 2022, which again is well above our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework, and 300 basis points higher than the core growth for 2022 provided last November at our Investor Day.\nThis strong constant currency growth is driven by stronger non-mortgage revenue growth of 20% total and 13% organic due to broad-based performance across Workforce Solutions and strength in International. As detailed on Slide 7, U.S. mortgage revenue was down about 30% in the quarter. This compares to third quarter mortgage originations of down 57%, as estimated by mortgage industry third parties and USIS credit inquiries that declined 41%. As a reminder, in a rising rate environment, we believe consumers tend to rate shop more frequently, creating a favorable variance between mortgage credit inquiries and originations that benefits USIS credit file pulls from shopping.\nIn the third quarter, we saw mortgage credit inquiries perform in the order of 16 points better than the change in the estimated mortgage originations. USIS revenue declined 35% in the quarter, about 6 points better than credit inquiries. However, TWN income and employment is typically pooled later in the mortgage application process and at closing. As a result, EWS does not benefit as much from the upfront shopping trend that occurs in a rising rate environment, as TWN increase are more closely aligned with completed mortgage originations. TWN mortgage revenue declined 28% in the quarter.\nEWS core mortgage revenue growth, that was up a strong 14% in the quarter, and when adjusting for the 16-point negative spread between mortgage inquiries and originations, was up a very strong 30% and consistent with prior quarters. Overall, Equifax mortgage revenue outperformed USIS credit inquiries by 11% or 11 points in the quarter and outperformed estimated mortgage originations by a strong 27 points in the quarter. This reflects the strength of our U.S. enterprise mortgage sales and operations team that bring the combined USIS and EWS products and solutions to market in this challenging mortgage macro.\nTurning to Slide 8. Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter with 32% core revenue growth, driven by very strong non-mortgage non-UC and ERC growth of 62%. As a reminder, non-mortgage revenue is now about 70% of Workforce Solutions and a big Workforce Solutions' driver for future growth from their fast-growing talent and government verticals. Workforce Solutions' above-market 32% core growth in the quarter continues to be driven by very strong performance on TWN record additions, new products and pricing, system-to-system integrations and greater penetration. Their market outperformance is very strong, particularly in a period of declining market transaction volumes for mortgage.\nWe expect to see continued very strong core growth in fourth quarter from Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions' team continued outstanding execution across their key growth drivers, detailed on the right-hand side of the slide.\nOver the past 12 months, we've signed 10 new agreements with payroll processors in the U.S., including 3 new agreements in the third quarter that will be added to the TWN database over the next several quarters. These new partnerships, along with continued growth in our direct contributors through our Employer Services business, are delivering continued strong growth in the TWN database with current records up 16%, reaching 146 million current records in the third quarter. Their 111 million unique individuals in TWN deliver very high hit rates and represent over 2/3 of the 165 million U.S. nonfarm payroll.\nAnd as a reminder, about 50% of our TWN records are contributed directly from individual employers that we have long relationships with. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies.\nIn addition to traditional W-2 wage earners, we estimate there are approximately 30 million to 40 million gig workers and 20 million to 30 million pensioners in the U.S., who will also bring valuable income and employment insights to lenders, background screeners and government agencies. We recently signed an agreement with a payroll processor to gain access to their pension or records, and we have an active pipeline with other companies to acquire new pension records to the TWN database.\nWe're in the very early innings of collecting records on these 50 million to 70 million gig and pensioner records, but expect to make significant progress as we move through 2023 and beyond. TWN record additions will continue to drive Workforce Solutions' revenue going forward from higher hit rates, and we have the ability to double our records in the future to the roughly 220 million total W-2 gig and pension recipients in the United States. This is an incredibly powerful lever for future growth at Workforce Solutions and a key driver of their 13% to 15% long-term growth outlook.\nTurning to Slide 9 with some more detail in Workforce Solutions. They really had an exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $559 million. Revenue was up a strong 9% with overall organic revenue growth of about flat overall despite the significant 28% decline in EWS mortgage revenue in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 40% and is now 70% of Workforce Solutions.\nVerification Services revenue of $455 million was up 13%, more than offsetting the 57% decline in estimated mortgage originations. Non-mortgage verticals now represent over 60% of Verifier revenue and delivered 72% total and 30% organic growth.\nThe Insights business, which we acquired late last year, continues to perform very well, driven by strong performance in their largest verticals, Risk Intelligence and Justice. Risk Intelligence helps background screeners analyze people's risks via background checks and continuous monitoring. Justice Intelligence helps channel partners assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations.\nTalent and Government Solutions, which now represent almost 40% of Verifier non-mortgage, had outstanding quarters. Talent Solutions delivered 110% total and over 50% organic growth in the quarter from record growth, pricing and strong new product rollouts.\nWe also saw a strong growth in the government vertical, with revenue up 90% total and 44% organic, driven by strong penetration at the state level. The EWS government vertical is benefiting from penetration, pricing, record growth and leveraging a strong product portfolio, including Insights data at the federal, state and local level across the United States.\nThe continued expansion of Workforce Solutions' Data Hub through our new total Verifier solution is driving very strong growth in the fast-growing 5 billion talent and 2 billion government markets. Our new -- our TotalVerify solution is enabling our customers to access multidata solutions derived from an unparalleled set of differentiated information assets spanning employment, income, education, incarceration, health credentialing and identity.\nAs of the third quarter, EWS has over 580 million total records in the TWN database, both current and historic, that provide both current and previous employment information on individuals, allowing us to increasingly provide an instant digital resume or employment verification on both current and historical job histories.\nThe non-mortgage EWS Consumer Lending business, principally in card, auto and consumer finance and led by our U.S. enterprise sales teams, also showed good growth with revenue up 18% in the quarter. Employer Services revenue of $104 million was down 7% due to the expected decline in our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses. We expected total UC and ERC revenue to be down about 20% in 2022, driven by the lower jobless claims and ERC transactions as the COVID federal tax program runs out.\nEmployer Services revenue, excluding UC and ERC, was up a strong 29% in the quarter, driven by broad-based double-digit growth in our I-9 and onboarding, healthy FX and our tax credit businesses. We are increasingly seeing the ability to deliver bundled packages of our differentiated Employer Services solutions to customers.\nIn the third quarter, we signed a large multiyear agreement to provide a broad suite of EWS solutions, including I-9, W-4, tax services and other HR solutions, to a large multinational company with annual guaranteed Workforce Solutions revenues approaching $20 million with total annual revenue opportunities with the agreement of over $30 million.\nWorkforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.5% were lower than our July guidance and the over 50% margins we expect from EWS on an ongoing basis. The main drivers of the lower-than-expected margin was negative mix due to lower mortgage revenue; higher sales and marketing costs, principally due to very strong non-mortgage revenue growth; and costs to add the new TWN contributors I talked about earlier.\nThe decline in EBITDA margins versus last year was driven by similar factors, including negative product margin mix as higher-margin mortgage declined as a percentage of revenue and was replaced with Verifier non-mortgage revenue and revenue from the most recent acquisitions, which, at this point, have lower margins than Verifier overall.\nAnd second, increased marketing and sales expense from both investments to drive NPI and driven by our extremely strong nonmortgage sales and record acquisition performance. And then last, as I mentioned, costs related to onboarding new TWN contributors.\nWe expect these same factors to impact margin -- sorry, EWS margins in fourth quarter as we see further declines in mortgage revenue, with EWS EBITDA margins of about 48.5% in fourth quarter. As we look to 2023, we expect to see EWS margins return to above 50% as product and pricing initiatives expand profitability, and we see additional savings from their cloud transformation.\nThe strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in the third quarter. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another above-market quarter with 9% revenue growth and 32% core growth and are well-positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continue above-market growth in the future.\nAs shown on Slide 10, USIS revenue of about $397 million was down 9% and slightly better than our expectations. USIS mortgage revenue was down about 35% and was also better than expected with a 41% decline in credit inquiries versus the 46% we had expected. At $97 million, mortgage revenue is now about 25% of total USIS revenue.\nB2B non-mortgage revenue was $250 million, which represents over 60% of total USIS revenue, and was up 5% with organic revenue growth of 3%. This was below the low end of the 6% to 7% growth we discussed in July. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth remained strong at 9% total and 6% organic, a sign that lenders continue to originate. During the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in commercial and telco and solid single-digit growth across financial services, auto and insurance, offset by a decline in our direct-to-consumer business.\nKount, which provides unique identity and fraud solutions, continues to execute very well, developing joint solutions leveraging both Kount and Equifax data, with 2022 global revenue expected to exceed 20%. The recent acquisition of Midigator will continue to strengthen our Identity & Fraud franchise and growth.\nThe weakness relative to expectations in the quarter was again in Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business, that had revenue of $51 million, down 8% and lower than our expectations. As we discussed in previous quarters, the principal driver of decline in FMS services was our fraud and data services vertical, where we provide header data principally to providers of Identity & Fraud Services and, to a much lesser extent, in our Risk Management and Portfolio Review business where we provide data and analytical services to financial institutions to evaluate the health of their existing portfolios or, in some cases, portfolios they're acquiring.\nAs we discussed in prior quarters, we expect the declines in these businesses to continue through the fourth quarter, with improvements in 2023 as we introduce new products, leveraging unique and differentiated data assets available through the new Equifax single data fabric.\nWe also saw a decline in batch marketing services where we provide data and decisioning, principally to financial institutions for pre screeners as well as delivering our IXI data for marketing activities as some customers cut back on originations. We had seen high single-digit growth in marketing services in the first half. So this is the first signs of any pullback in marketing.\nFor fourth quarter B2B non-mortgage, we expect online to continue to be strong with growth rates above third quarter from commercial execution as well as progress in pricing and new product rollouts that overcome a somewhat slower growth in financial services. We expect financial marketing services to continue to be weak, down over 10%, with declines across header risk and marketing continuing in the fourth quarter. Overall, for B2B non-mortgage, we expect fourth quarter organic revenue growth to be about the levels we saw in the third quarter.\nUSIS Consumer Solutions business had revenue of $50 million, down 1% in the quarter but up 2% sequentially. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow again sequentially with positive growth rates in the fourth quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.1% in the quarter and slightly below our expectations, principally due to continued investments in sales resources focused on non-mortgage growth.\nInternational revenue, as shown on Slide 11, was up $288 million, up a very strong 17% on a local currency basis and 15% on a nonorganic constant currency basis. We're seeing broad-based execution from our International businesses. Europe local currency revenue was up 24%, principally driven by over 75% growth in our U.K. debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K. government over the past several quarters.\nOur European CRA revenue accelerated in the third quarter with revenue up 7% and above our expectations, driven by broad-based product execution across our B2B online products and Identity & Fraud, slightly offset by lower consumer revenue. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia and New Zealand business, delivered local currency revenue of 6%, driven by strong growth in our Commercial and Identity & Fraud businesses and, to a lesser extent, growth in Consumer.\nLatin America local currency revenue was up a strong 34% driven by double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador in Central America. The team's new product introductions over the past 3 years and pricing actions continue to drive strong growth across all product lines. This is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for Latin America.\nCanada local currency revenue was up 12% and above our expectations. We saw growth in commercial, Analytics Solutions, decisioning and Identity & Fraud revenue, which was partially offset by some onetime revenue in the quarter from mortgage volume declines. Consumer revenue also returned to growth during the quarter. We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth from Canada in the fourth quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.8% were down 200 basis point -- down 210 basis points sequentially and above our expectations given strong revenue growth.\nEBITDA margins were up slightly versus last year, but up about 150 basis points adjusting for the loss of equity income from the Russian joint venture that we sold. As shown on Slide 12, we had a very strong new product quarter with Vitality Index at 14%, which is our highest Vitality Index ever, and it was over 500 basis points above last year's results and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term growth framework for Vitality.\nWe delivered about 80 new products so far in 2022, leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities. We now expect to deliver a Vitality Index of 13% in 2022, up 200 basis points from our previous guide of 11%, which equates to over $650 million of new product revenue in the year. The growth in our 2022 Vitality Index is principally coming from Workforce Solutions, which is encouraging, as they are further along in completing their cloud transformation.\nIt's positive to see the strong NPI results in the early innings of the Equifax cloud. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new Equifax cloud capabilities and single data fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and driving future Equifax top line growth. This week at the Annual Mortgage Bankers Association Conference, we will showcase a new offering that delivers telecommunications, PayTV and utilities attributes, alongside the traditional mortgage credit report, to help streamline the mortgage underwriting process.\nDelivering telco, PayTV and utilities attributes to mortgage lenders alongside the traditional credit reports will also help expand access to credit and help create greater homeownership opportunities for U.S. consumers. The use of these expanded data insights can also provide visibility to millions of credit and visible consumers, those without traditional credit files and enhance the financial profiles of thin, young and unscorable consumers as they complete their first mortgage applications.\nThis new offering, leveraging the Equifax cloud, will provide powerful new insights that help to automate, save time and resources and streamline the first mortgage process for every applicant, creating more opportunity for consumers to secure alone. And Equifax is the first and only in the industry to offer these unique insights to the mortgage industry.\nTurning to Slide 13. We outlined the 12 strategic bolt-on acquisitions we completed since January 2021. You expect we'll deliver over $450 million of principally non-mortgage run rate revenue. As you know, our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework includes 1% to 2% of annual revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A, aligned around our 3 strategic priorities: first, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; second, building out our Identity & Fraud capabilities; and third, adding unique data assets.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide more details on the mortgage market and our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance.\n\nJohn W. Gamble\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & COO, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned and as shown on Slide 14, our guidance reflects an expectation that the decline in the U.S. mortgage market will steepen in the fourth quarter with mortgage originations declining over 60% and mortgage credit inquiries declining over 50%. This is a significant reduction from our expectations in July. And as Mark referenced earlier, this expectation of a further weakening of the mortgage market negatively impacts 4Q revenue by almost $45 million.\n3Q mortgage revenue was 21.9% of total Equifax revenues compared to 29.5% and 24.7% in 1Q '22 and 2Q '22, respectively. In 4Q, we expect mortgage revenue to be about 16% of total Equifax revenues. The rapidly changing and unprecedented macro environment makes forecasting the impacts on the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We will continue to be transparent with you about changes in the mortgage market and the impacts on our business.\nEBITDA margins at 32.5% were slightly below the level of at or below 33% we discussed in our July guidance. Mark discussed the main drivers in HBU. Partially offsetting these items were lower corporate and corporate technology expenses.\nSlide 15 provides our guidance for 4Q '22. We expect revenue in the range of $1.165 billion to $1.185 billion, reflecting revenue down about 6.3% year-to-year at the midpoint of our guidance or down about 3.7% on a constant currency basis. 4Q '22 EBITDA margins are expected to be about 31.5%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 4Q '22 to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share compared to 4Q '21 adjusted EPS of $1.84 per share.\nAs Mark shared earlier, the decline in our 4Q '22 guidance, as compared to implied levels we shared in July, is driven by the significant reduction in our expectations for the U.S. mortgage market in the fourth quarter. 4Q '22 revenue and our current guidance relative to our implied view in July is down about $25 million. Mark covered this earlier, as a $45 million decline from the weakening U.S. mortgage market and $15 million decline driven by FX are partially offset by revenue from the acquisitions of LawLogix and Midigator and stronger non-mortgage revenue growth.\n4Q 2022 adjusted EPS and our current guidance relative to our implied view in July is down about $0.21 per share or about $33 million in pretax income. This decline is driven by the impact of the decline in the U.S. mortgage market on revenue of $45 million, which, given high variable margins, drives a pretax income decline that exceeds the total variance level.\nStrong core revenue growth, both from the acquisitions of LawLogix and Midigator as well as stronger organic growth, are delivering improvements in pretax income. However, these improvements are being offset by the higher marketing sales and G&A expense that we referenced earlier and higher interest and other expenses. Reflecting the above, our expectations for the BUs in the fourth quarter are as follows: EWS revenue is expected to have an about 3% or greater decline. Continued strong non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to offset the bulk of the impact on EWS mortgage revenue of the expected over 60% decline in mortgage originations.\nEWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 48.5% in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to have an about 7.5% or greater decline, reflecting the greater-than-50% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage and credit inquiries. B2B non-mortgage revenue growth is expected to improve from the levels we saw in the third quarter, and B2B online continuing with high single-digit growth. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to approach 36%.\nInternational continues to deliver a strong year and is expected to deliver constant currency revenue growth of up to 8.5%, down from the third quarter, as we lap growth from our U.K. debt management business. International EBITDA margins are expected to be up sequentially, approaching 29%. The declines in both revenue and adjusted EPS in 4Q 2022 year-to-year are also principally driven by the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market and the significant impact of FX.\nLooking at revenue. At the midpoint of our guidance of $1.175 billion, revenue is down about $78 million. FX is negative, about $35 million or 2.6% year-to-year. So on a constant currency basis, revenue is down about $43 million. The impact of the decline in the U.S. mortgage market, using originations declines for EWS and credit inquiries declines for USIS, is negative, about $185 million or almost 15 points. Excluding these factors, effectively, constant dollar revenue growth, excluding the impact of the U.S. mortgage market, revenues up over $140 million, reflecting predominantly the very strong non-mortgage growth, principally in EWS and International and also in U.S. B2B online; and strong outperformance in mortgage relative to the overall market, predominantly in EWS.\nLooking at adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of our guidance of $1.50, adjusted EPS is down about $0.34 a share. The low operating income items, principally higher interest expense and the loss of equity income from our Russia JV as well as the impact of FX, explains just over half of the decline in adjusted EPS. The remainder of the decline is principally driven by the reduction in constant currency revenue of about $43 million.\nSlide 16 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance. We expect revenue of approximately $5.1 billion, and adjusted EPS is expected to be $7.49 to $7.59 per share. For the full year of 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be over $550 million. Capital expenditures are above the levels we expected in July as we maintained capital spending at first half 2022 levels in the third quarter to continue the pace of migration of major exchanges to our cloud infrastructure. We expect to bring down capital spending in 2023, consistent with the completion of the migration of the major North American exchanges.\nWe believe both our fourth quarter and full year guidance is centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provide. As you consider the first quarter of 2023, we wanted to provide some general perspective on our current thinking on the U.S. mortgage market for the quarter. Using our current view of mortgage credit inquiries in the fourth quarter as a base, we currently expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 50% year-to-year in the first quarter of '23. As we move through 2023, the year-to-year compares get substantially easier, particularly in the second half.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Turning to Slide 17. We have some very unique macros in our industry and EVX growth levers driving our performance in 2023 and beyond. The acceleration of the digital macro across every industry is expanding the use of identity data signals and solutions to drive better decisions across new and existing verticals. Equifax is well-positioned to take advantage of the accelerating digital macro through our EFX cloud investments and our recent acquisitions of Insights, Kount and Midigator.\nAlthough we've been impacted by the significant declines in the U.S. mortgage market, we believe we have unique levers at Equifax to deliver strong future growth, including Workforce Solutions' above-market growth and margins; and our expanded focus on new data assets like Insights, USIS non-mortgage growth; and Kount and Midigator, Identity & Fraud growth; our new EFX cloud-driving competitive NPIs, top line and of course, cost savings in '23 and beyond; NPIs leveraging the EFX Cloud and our expanded resources and focus on new products and bolt-on M&A to broaden strength in Equifax.\nThese attractive market macros, along with the broad EFX growth levers and our strong core outperformance -- strong core and non-mortgage outperformance in the past few years, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver above-market growth in the future. In the event we do see further economic weakness driven by slowing consumer demand, we believe Equifax is well-positioned for continued growth.\nAs we shared with you in July, turning to Slide 18, the new Equifax is a much different and more diverse business than we were in the last recession. We are more resilient and better positioned for stronger revenue and earnings growth in challenging economic environments.\nDuring the '08-'09 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency you would expect from a data analytics businesses. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue. Importantly, EWS grew throughout the global financial crisis and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009. We believe that Equifax business mix today is much better positioned for a potential economic event than in 2009.\nFirst, strong EWS growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 16% of revenue in 2009 to almost 50% today, with margins over 50% and over 15 percentage points higher than the Equifax average. EWS is benefiting from strong growth levers that are not directly tied to economic activity, including record growth; penetration in new and fast-growing verticals like talent and government; system and system integrations, deploying new higher-value products; as well as measured price actions, taking advantage of the scale of the TWN database.\nSecond, completion of the Equifax cloud will deliver cost savings in 2023 and beyond that we expect will drive about half of our targeted 500 basis point margin expansion from 2022 to 2025. The cloud migration cost savings are independent of any economic event and driven solely by our execution.\nAnd then last, we're leveraging the new Equifax cloud to accelerate new product rollouts with a goal of 13% Vitality in 2022, which is over $650 million of annual incremental revenue from Equifax. As a reminder, NPIs rolled out in '21 and '22 will drive top line growth in 2023 and beyond as they mature in the marketplace. Today, we believe about 54% of our global business is recession-resilient or countercyclical and will grow in a recession. This is a big change in a strong position compared to Equifax in the '08, '09 global financial crisis, where only about 37% of our businesses were either recession-resilient or countercyclical.\nThe meaningful revenue growth in Workforce Solutions, U.S. Mortgage and Identity & Fraud since 2009 as well as cloud transformation cost savings position Equifax very well if there is an economic event or recession in 2023 and beyond.\nWrapping up on Slide 19. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter, driven by 13% organic and 20% total non-mortgage constant dollar growth that more than offset the 41% decline in the mortgage market, reflecting the broad-based strength of Equifax in this challenging economic environment.\nThis is our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit non-mortgage growth. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient, on offense and investing for future growth.\nAgainst the unprecedented 37% mortgage market decline in 2022, we expect to deliver constant currency revenue growth of over 5% due to the breadth and strength of our underlying businesses. More importantly, our core revenue growth of 17% and non-mortgage constant currency growth of 20% are both well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and reflect the strength of the underlying Equifax business model. This strong momentum positions us well in 2023 and beyond.\nEWS continues to deliver above-market growth and is our largest, fastest-growing and highest-margin business. Workforce Solutions' above-market revenue growth over the past 3 years is powering Equifax growth as they approach 50% of our revenue. And new products leveraging the new Equifax cloud are also driving growth. Our 13% Vitality from NPIs in 2022 will drive growth in 2023 and beyond. And we're in the early days of leveraging the new Equifax cloud to drive innovation, new products and expect to deliver strong Vitality in the future.\nOur 12 bolt-on acquisitions since January '21 have expanded our capabilities and are delivering strong top line growth and will deliver synergies in 2023 and beyond. And then lastly, we're in the final chapters of completing our new Equifax cloud data and technology transformation that will deliver top line growth and cost benefits in '23 and beyond as we complete the cloud and leverage our new cloud capabilities and single data fabric. Even in this uncertain economic environment, Equifax continues to be on offense and reinvesting in the new Equifax cloud, new products, data and analytics and bolt-on M&A to drive future growth.\nWe continue to be confident in our long-term growth framework of 8% to 12% total revenue growth and 7% to 10% organic revenue growth with ongoing expansion of margins of 50 basis points per year. We also remain focused on delivering on our 2025 goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins that we set at our Investor Day a year ago. Our ability to deliver non-mortgage growth of 20% in 2022, that is well above our long-term growth framework, gives us confidence in the future. We remain energized about our performance in 2022 in a challenging mortgage macro and even more energized about the future of the new Equifax, a faster-growing, higher-margin, cloud-native data analytics company.\nAnd with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.",

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTrevor Burns\n\nSVP of Corporate IR, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com, -- during the call, we will make reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website.\nThese materials are labeled Q2 2022 earnings conference call. Also, we'll be making reference to certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nCertain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance.\nThese non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial and vote at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, beginning on Slide 4.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another solid quarter with record second quarter revenue of $1.32 billion, which was up 7% and at the middle of our April guidance, including the negative impact of 190 basis points or $23 million of FX. Constant currency revenue growth was almost 9% and 8.5%. Adjusted EPS of $2.09 was above the top end of our April guidance range with U.S. mortgage market overall, about at the level of our April guidance, with U.S. mortgage credit inquiries down 33% versus last year.\nAs expected, the mortgage market decline increased as we moved through the quarter. In the first half of July, mortgage credit inquiries were down about 40% versus last year. Core revenue growth in the quarter of 19% and core organic revenue growth of 16% in the quarter were very strong, consistent with our expectations, which allowed us to deliver the 8.5% constant currency growth against a 33% U.S. mortgage market decline.\nImportantly, non-mortgage constant currency growth of 22% was very strong in the quarter and well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework. And of course, this represents about 75% of Equifax revenue. Workforce Solutions core revenue growth of 41% was outstanding and above our expectations. International delivered 11.5%. Constant currency growth, which was also above our expectations and USIS B2B non-mortgage growth at 6% was up from first quarter, but lower than we expected. B2B non-mortgage online was strong at 9%.\nHowever, our B2B offline business was much weaker than expected, declining 5% in the quarter, and I'll cover this more fully shortly. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $461 million, up 7% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 35% were about in line with our expectations for the quarter.\nWe continue to make strong progress during the quarter on our EFX cloud data and technology transformation. Year-to-date, we've migrated approximately 14,500 customers to the cloud in the U.S. And since the start of the transformation, we now have migrated about 70% of our U.S. customers.\nSo far in 2022, we also migrated approximately 13,000 international customers and decommissioned 4 U.S. data centers. Leveraging our new EFX cloud infrastructure, we continue to invest in new product resources and accelerate new product innovations. So far in 2022, we've released 50 -- over 50 new products, continuing the momentum from 2021, where we launched a record 151 new products. In the quarter, our vitality index, defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last 3 years was extremely strong and exceeded 13%.\nThis is over a 400 basis point improvement from our 9% vitality last year and the highest level in over 10 years at Equifax. For 2022, we expect vitality of over 11%, which is a 100 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality goal and a 100 basis points above the framework when we started the year. This strong NPI performance will benefit our growth in the second half and in 2023 and beyond.\nWe continue to invest our strong free cash flow and strategic bolt-on acquisitions with the acquisition of LawLogix that we announced earlier this morning, which will further strengthen our EWS Employer Solutions I-9 and immigration regulatory service capabilities.\nThis is our sixth acquisition in Workforce Solutions since January 2021 and aligned with our M&A strategy to strengthen Workforce, our largest and fastest-growing business. Bolt-on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are a strong lever for future growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add a 100 to 200 basis points to our revenue growth annually from strategic bolt-on M&A. We are very pleased with our strong second quarter results, particularly our strong 22% non-mortgage constant currency growth.\nThis is clearly an unprecedented economic environment with record inflation, strong Fed actions and the impact from higher interest rates on the mortgage market. Despite our strong first half performance, we felt it was prudent to adjust our 2022 guidance to reflect expectations for a further weakening of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half beyond the framework we provided in April as well as the significant negative impact of FX from the stronger dollar.\nImportantly, our expectations for 2022 core revenue growth remains a very strong 17%. And our expectation for constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth remains a very strong 19%, both unchanged from our April guidance. While our second quarter mortgage results were aligned with our April guidance, we thought there was enough uncertainty between future Fed actions, the impact on interest rates and mortgage activity to further adjust our second half mortgage outlook.\nOur updated expectations for mortgage are that credit inquiries will decline by over 46% in the second half, which is down about 600 basis points from our April framework with mortgage originations declining 200 to 300 basis points beyond these levels.\nThis compares to the Mortgage Bankers Association forecast for the second half of 2022 mortgage origination units of down 43.5% that was released last night. As you know, USIS mortgage revenue is tied more closely to credit inquiries, while Workforce Solutions revenue is tied more closely to mortgage originations.\nAnd for the second half of 2022, FX was a headwind of over $40 million, up from an impact of about $7 million in our April guidance from the stronger dollar. The change in the second half mortgage inquiries and FX impact results in our revised 2022 guidance for revenue at the midpoint of $5.1 billion, down $100 million from our April framework, but still up almost 4% versus last year or 5% on a constant currency basis. This reduction in revenue is about 2/3 related to mortgage with the balance from FX.\nOur updated adjusted EPS guidance is to a midpoint of $7.68, down $0.47 from our April guidance and up about 1% from 2021. As I said earlier, there's no change in our core organic revenue growth framework, which remains a very strong 15% for 2022 and 13% in the second half of 2022, and our non-mortgage growth framework, which remains up a strong 16% for the year and 12% in the second half as we comp off some strong double-digit results in the second half of 2021. In the second half of 2022, non-mortgages at about 80% of Equifax revenue consistent with 2019 and up from 68% last year.\nTurning to Slide 5. In the second quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars grew a very strong 19%, which was in line with our expectations and substantially above our long-term financial framework of 8% to 12%. Core organic revenue growth of 16% in the quarter was also substantially above the long-term framework of 7% to 10% for organic growth. Non-mortgage organic growth in EWS, International and USIS drove about 12 points of core organic revenue growth in the quarter.\nCore mortgage out-performance of 13%, predominantly in Workforce Solutions drove the remaining 4% of second quarter core organic revenue growth. Both were very strong performances. With our strong 19% core growth in the quarter and accelerating NPI rollouts, we continue to expect 2022 core revenue growth of 17%. This is driven by broad-based strong performance across Workforce Solutions as well as strength in USIS non-mortgage B2B online and international, which is supported by our accelerated new product introductions.\nAs detailed on Slide 6, U.S. core mortgage revenue growth in the quarter was up a strong 13% driven by Workforce Solutions core mortgage revenue growth of 20% and 2% in USIS. Second quarter mortgage revenue was down only 19%, despite the 33% decline in the overall U.S. mortgage market as measured by our credit inquiries and an MBA June estimated decline in mortgage originations of about 37%.\nWorkforce Solutions core mortgage growth of 20% continues to be driven by very strong performance on twin record additions, new products and pricing, system and system integrations and continued penetration.\nTheir 20 points of market out-performance is very strong, particularly in a period of declining market transaction volumes. We expect to see continued very strong core mortgage growth from EWS approaching this level in the second half. As a reminder, we estimate the U.S. mortgage market as the change in USIS credit inquiries. In a rising interest rate environment, we believe consumers tend to rate shop more frequently, thus creating a favorable variance between mortgage credit inquiries and originations.\nThis trend benefits USIS credit file poles. In the second quarter, we saw mortgage credit inquiries perform on the order of 4 points better than the estimated change in the mortgage origination units estimated by MBA. However, Twin income and employment is typically pulled later in the mortgage application process and at closing. As a result, EWS does not benefit as much from the upfront rate shopping trend that occurs in a rising interest rate environment as twin inquiries are more closely correlated to mortgage originations.\nTurning to Slide 7. In 2022, we expect non-mortgage revenues to be 77% of total Equifax revenues, which is up a very strong 900 basis points from the 68% of total Equifax revenues that we saw in 2021. Given the above-market growth in fast-growing Workforce Solutions verticals such as talent, government and card, further penetration identity and fraud accelerated by our 2021 acquisition account and accelerated NPIs with a vitality index expected to be 11% in 2022 and of course, growth in our international markets.\nWe also expect non-mortgage revenue will benefit from being the only cloud-native credit bureau through always-on system stability, faster transaction processing and leveraging the Data Fabric to expand our NPIs. Turning now to Slide 8. Workforce Solutions delivered outstanding 41% core revenue growth in the second quarter, the fifth quarter over 40% revenue growth in the last 6 quarters and their 10th quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by outstanding nonmortgage growth of over 50%.\nAs a reminder, non-mortgage revenue is over 65% of Workforce Solutions and a big EWS growth driver for the future. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team continued outstanding execution across their key growth drivers, detailed on the right-hand side of this slide.\nAs I referenced earlier, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire LawLogix last night, the next in a string of bolt-on acquisitions that strengthened Workforce Solutions Employer Services vertical and adds twin records. Over the past 2 years, we've completed 6 bolt-on acquisitions supporting Workforce Solutions growth, including Appriss Insights and Law Logic this morning.\nTurning to Slide 9. Workforce Solutions very strong performance is driven by the team's consistent execution across their key growth levers that will drive their long-term growth of 13% to 15%, including first, growing the Work number database. Since late last year, we signed 4 new exclusive agreements with large payroll processors that we started to board in the second quarter and expect to have all of them contributing records by the end of the third quarter. We ended the quarter with $144 million total current records, which is up a very strong 22% from last year and up 6% sequentially.\nThese $144 million total records represent 110 million unique individuals, representing 2/3 of the over 160 million W-2 employees included in U.S. non-farm payroll. In addition to traditional W-2 wage earners, we estimate there are approximately 30 million to 40 million gig workers and 20 million to 30 million pensioners in the U.S. who will also bring valuable insights to lenders, background screeners and government agencies. We're in the very early innings of collecting records on these 50 million to 70 million non W-2 wage earners but expect to make significant progress as we move through '22 and 2023.\nWe have the ability to double our twin database with a total potential market for income and employment information on about 220 million individuals versus the $110 million we have today. As a reminder, over 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. The vast majority of our partnerships with payroll companies are exclusive, including all the relationships we've signed in the past 4-plus years.\nSecond, workforce is increasing penetration in their key non-mortgage verticals of mortgage, talent, government and consumer finance with all 4 verticals having significant opportunity for continued expansion by new products, leveraging our expanding twin active and historical data assets. Our talent and government businesses have seen average organic growth of over 50% since last year and over 20% CAGR since 2017.\nOur strength in talent and government is driven by the depth and coverage of our twin database with over 570 million total records, both current and historic that provide both current and previous employment information on individuals, allowing us to increasingly provide an instant digital resume or employment verification on both current and historical job histories. The expanding depth of our twin database and expansion of the Workforce Solutions talent data hub as well as the increasing ease of integrations as workforce leverages the API capabilities through our new Google Cloud is also providing the ability to continue to increase penetration in key verticals.\nFourth, workforce is expanding their system-to-system integrations. Currently, more than 75% of our mortgage transactions are system-to-system integrations as web access, which is up over 2 versus web access, which is up over 2x from 2019. As you know, we get about a 20% lift in mortgage pulls when we convert our customers from web to system-to-system integrations. In Talent Solutions, System-to-System now represents more than 85% of transactions while in government, we have more opportunity with about 65% of transactions on a system-to-system basis.\nAs a reminder, close to 100% of credit files are delivered system-to-system for originations. From our perspective, it's only a matter of time for Twin to approach these levels of system-to-system integrations with customers, which, of course, will drive our revenue.\nAs workforce continues to deliver greater value to customers through deepening the database and extending real-time system-to-system integrations and accelerating its launch of higher-value, vertical-specific new products, average revenue per transaction will continue to grow significantly, both through higher value and price new products and annual price increases.\nAs I said earlier, Rudy and the EWS team have a long runway for growth, leveraging multiple levers in 2022 and beyond. We have a lot of confidence in Workforce's ability to deliver on their 13% to 15% long-term framework. As a reminder, over the past 3 years, they've delivered 34% CAGR, which, of course, is well above their 13% to 15% long-term growth framework.\nTurning to Slide 10. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering $609 million of revenue, their second revenue quarter above $600 million. Revenue growth was up a very strong 21%, with organic revenue growth of 11%, despite the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue is now over 65% of Workforce Solutions, with organic growth of 30%.\nVerification Services revenue of $505 million, up 28%, was over $500 million for the second quarter in a row, again, despite the decline in the mortgage market. Non-mortgage verticals now represent almost 60% of Verifier revenue and delivered 90% and 53% -- 90% total and 53% organic growth. Appriss Insights, which we acquired late last year, delivered strong 15% growth in the quarter. Growth was strong in their key verticals of Risk and Justice Intelligence.\nRisk Intelligence helps background screeners analyze people risks via background checks and continuous monitoring and Justice Intelligence helps channel partners assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. Increased customer penetration, white space expansion and strong hiring volumes are driving growth, and their NPI pipeline also remains strong. We are very positive about the future growth and potential of our Insights business.\nTalent Government Solutions, which now represents 40% of Workforce Solutions and almost 80% of Verifier non-mortgage, respectively, both had outstanding quarters. Talent Solutions delivered 134% total and 73% organic growth in the quarter on record growth and strong new product revenue.\nWe also saw strong growth in the government vertical, with revenue up 100% total and 50% organic, with significant new wins at the state level and continued growth of our large SSA contract. The continued expansion of Workforce Solutions' data hub and the fast-growing 5 billion talent and 2 billion government TAMs is driving strong double-digit organic revenue growth in both verticals, leveraging Workforce Solutions over 570 million current and historical records for new products.\nThe integration of unique the Appriss Insights, National Student Clearinghouse, and other talent-related data assets strengthens our ability to deliver to these new solutions, leveraging the EWS data hub and drive outsized growth in the future. The non-mortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, also showed strong growth, up 18% in the quarter and debt management grew over 70% in the quarter.\nEmployer Services revenue of $105 million was down 3% due to the expected decline in our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses. We expect total UC and ERC revenue to be down over 25% during '22, driven by lower jobless claims and lower ERC transactions as well as the COVID federal tax credit program as the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer Services revenue, excluding UC and ERC, was up a strong 42% in the quarter, driven by strong base double-digit growth in our I-9 and on-boarding healthy FX and our tax credit businesses.\nWorkforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margin remained strong at 53.4%. In the quarter, we increased spending relative to our April expectations on both technology and marketing, principally for new products. The strength of Workforce Solutions and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses was clear again in the second quarter.\nRudy and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter with 21% revenue growth and 41% core growth, well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework. And we're well positioned to deliver a very strong '22 and continue above market growth in the future.\nTurning now to Slide 11. USIS revenue of $421 million was down 7.5% compared to last year and slightly below our expectations. The decline was driven by the reduction in USIS mortgage revenue, which, at $113 million, is about 25% of total USIS revenue and was down 29% in the quarter, about 4 percentage points better than the overall mortgage market credit inquiries that declined 33%.\nImportantly, USIS delivered their sixth consecutive quarter of growth in B2B non-mortgage revenue of $259 million, which represents over 60% of total USIS revenue and was up 6% with our organic revenue growth of 4%. This was at the low end of the 6% to 7% growth we discussed in April due to lower-than-expected FMS, financial marketing services revenue. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was strong at 9%, with 7% organic growth.\nDuring the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in insurance, financial services, commercial as well as Kount, our identity and fraud business. We also saw growth in direct-to-consumer, with auto about flat in the quarter on favorable pricing offset by lower volumes given the continued auto supply chain issues.\nKount, which provides unique identity and fraud solution, continues to perform very well. Our core new product growth continues to be strong, and the team continues to execute on the development of joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data, including combining Kount's market-leading Omniscore AI capabilities and digital identity data with Equifax's physical identity into a single score to enhance fraud protection.\nFinancial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business, had revenue of $55 million, down 5% year-over-year. and although better than the first quarter, was lower than our expectations. FMS is principally comprised of 3 lines of business, including first fraud and data services, in which we provide header data principally to providers of identity and fraud services, which is the line of business is driving the weakness in our B2B off-line.\nFraud and data services historically represents over 20% of our off-line revenue which declined substantially in the first half. We saw this decline in the first quarter as customers either decreased frequency of refresh data or shifted to use of their own internal data. This decline continued in the second quarter.\nRevenue was about 10% of B2B off-line in the first half. We expect revenue at this level to continue through 2022 as the team focuses on bringing new solutions to market later this year.\nMarketing Services, which represents over half of B2B off-line revenue in the first half, performed very well growing with but not consistent with our non-mortgage B2B online organic growth. This is the business in which we provide data in decisioning principally to financial institutions for prescreens as well as providing our IXI data for marketing activities.\nAnd third, risk management or portfolio review represents about 1/3 of B2B of off-line revenue. This is a line of business in which we provide data and analytics services to financial institutions to evaluate the health of their existing portfolios or in some cases, portfolios they're acquiring. This business is often somewhat countercyclical as customers perform more risk analytics during weak economic periods. This business was down slightly in the first half and slightly weaker than expected. We expect this business to be down slightly for the remainder of the year.\nOverall, for our Financial Marketing Services and B2B offline for the remainder of 2022, we expect to see declines in line with the second quarter as the weakness in the fraud and data services is partially offset by continued good growth in marketing services. As we look to 2023, the completion of the Equifax new cloud data fabric will enable enhanced product offerings in B2B off-line combining U.S. credit file, DataX, Teletrac, Kount, ID and fraud and NCTUE data. We believe this will drive growth across all 3 of our B2B off-lines of business as we get to 2023.\nFor B2B non-mortgage in total, we expect to see continued strong online growth consistent with the first half. However, declines in Financial Marketing Services are expected to result in second half total B2B non-mortgage growth at or slightly below the bottom end of our long-term framework of 6% to 8% revenue growth.\nUSIS Consumer Solutions business, the U.S. D2C business from GCS that we combined with USIS in the fourth quarter last year, had revenue of 43 -- $49 million, up 3% in the quarter and about flat versus last year. We expect second half growth rates to improve as the team left the cloud to roll out NPIs.\nThe USIS sales team had a strong quarter with a number of key wins resulting in a healthy win rate and their new deal pipeline remains very strong with the overall pipe slightly higher than the first quarter. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 38.2% in the quarter, 110 basis points lower than the first quarter better than our expectations. The decline relative to the first quarter is principally driven by lower revenue from the decline in mortgage.\nTurning now to International. As shown on Slide 12, the revenue was $286 million, up a strong 11.5% on a local currency basis. We're seeing broad-based execution from our international businesses. Europe local currency revenue was up 16%, principally driven by strength in our U.K. debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K. government over the past several quarters that we expect to continue.\nOur European CRA businesses was about flat in the quarter and below our expectations, driven by declines in consumer, direct and commercial, partially offset by strong growth in identity and fraud. Asia Pacific local currency revenue was 6%, driven by strong growth in our Australia consumer business, HR services and identity and fraud.\nLatin America and local currency revenue was up 28%, driven by strong double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico and Central America. The team's strong new product introductions over the past 3 years and pricing actions continue to drive strong growth across the region. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for Latin America.\nCanada Local currency revenue was up 2% below our expectations. We saw growth in commercial and analytics solutions, which was partially offset by consumer services, mortgage-related products and online businesses due to interest rate increases. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 24.7% were down 200 basis points from last year due primarily to the elimination of equity income from our Russia joint venture.\nAs shown on Slide 13, we had another very strong new product quarter with our Vitality Index over 13%, which is up 400 basis points above our full year 2021 Vitality goal, and 300 basis points above our 10% long-term framework goal and our highest Vitality performance ever. Building on the record 151 new products last year, we delivered over 50 new products leveraging the new EFX Cloud so far in 2022 with broad-based execution across all of our business units. We've detailed some of the more significant new products on this slide.\nLeveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index of over 11% this year, which equates to over $550 million of new product revenue in 2022. We believe our strong NPI revenue generation is an important early indicator of the benefits of the new Equifax Cloud. New products leveraging our differentiated data and new EFX Cloud capabilities are central to our long-term growth framework and driving future Equifax top line growth.\nAs detailed on Slide 14, reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX 2023 growth strategy and long-term framework. We expect to add 1% to 2% of revenue growth annually from strategic bolt-on M&A, including LawLogix that we announced this morning. We've completed 11 acquisitions since January 2021, aligned with our strategy to add bolt-on M&A around 3 strategic priorities: number one, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; number two, adding unique data assets; and number three, building out and expanding our ID and fraud business.\nSlide 15 provides detail on our latest acquisition of LawLogix, which further strengthens our Workforce Solutions, Employer Solutions capabilities and provides I-9 management and immigration case management solutions focused on removing friction during the employee onboarding experience.\nLawLogix's suite of products supplements Employer Services capabilities by building upon investments made to help clients enable automation, deepen employee insights and increase efficiency. Our I-9 Anywhere product has seen very strong 45% growth over the past few years. The LawLogix acquisition is aligned with our M&A priority of expanding and strengthening our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide some more details on the mortgage market and our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance.\n\nJohn W. Gamble\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & COO, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned and as shown on Slide 16, our guidance now reflects an expectation that the U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries will decline over 46% in the second half of 2022, a continued decline from the down 40% level we're seeing in early July. Our assumptions reflect mortgage originations 200 to 300 basis points weaker than those levels, with the work number inquiries more closely linked to mortgage originations.\nThe reduction in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries of over 46% in the second half is off the second half 2021 reduction of over 20%. This level of U.S. mortgage credit inquiries in the second half is over 30% lower than the second half average levels we saw over the 2015 to 2019 period.\n1Q mortgage revenue was 29.5% of total Equifax revenues and 2Q mortgage revenue was 24.7% of total Equifax revenues. In 3Q, we expect mortgage to make up just over 21% of total Equifax revenues and about 23.5% in the full year of 2022.\nAs we have shared in prior quarters, Slide 17 provides a view of both the number of home mortgages that would have a rate benefit from refinancing on the left and a view of the levels of home purchases on the right. The left side of the slide provides a perspective on the number of home mortgages, for which refinancing would provide a rate benefit, the in-the-money population of mortgages.\nThe in-the-money population as of mid-July is about 1.9 million homes and below the 3.3 million we saw in April. At the current level, mortgage refi activity is heavily driven by cash-out refis that are often executed with no rate benefit or a rate increase. For perspective, for the most recent available Black Knight data for May 2022, about 95% of refinancings were cash-out.\nAs shown on the right side of Slide 17, the pace of existing home purchases continues at high levels, but were down about 7% in May and 14% in June from the levels we saw in 2021. We believe our assumptions for U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries over the last 6 months of 2022 reflect the trends just discussed. The 46.5% year-to-year decline in mortgage credit inquiries reflects a continued sequential weakening of the mortgage market, with third quarter inquiries down over 25% from the second quarter and fourth quarter down a further over 15% from these much reduced third quarter levels.\nThe rapidly changing and unprecedented macro environment makes forecasting the impact on the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We will continue to be transparent with you about changes in the mortgage market and the impacts on our business.\nSlide 18 provides a walk detailing the drivers of the 5.2% constant currency and 3.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.1 billion. The revenue decline from the midpoint of our April guidance of $5.2 billion is driven by about 2/3 by the decline in the mortgage revenue, reflecting the expectation of a weaker U.S. mortgage market. with the remainder due to a greater negative impact from FX.\nThe over 37% decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 12%, about 150 basis points more negative than the levels we discussed in April. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions' unemployment claims and the ERC businesses that we discussed with you in April, total headwinds into 2022 revenue growth are about 13 percentage points.\nAs Mark discussed earlier, core revenue growth is expected to be 17% and core organic revenue growth to be about almost 15%, consistent with our April guidance, both well above our long-term growth framework and reflecting outstanding growth and execution on new products.\nNon-mortgage organic revenue growth is driving 11% of the core organic revenue growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions, with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. International and USIS non-mortgage are also expected to drive core growth.\nSlide 19 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 0.4% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.68 per share. The growth in revenue and expansion in EBITDA margins by about 25 basis points drives growth in EPS of about 8%. Higher depreciation and interest expense and the negative impact of weaker FX are principally offsetting this growth in adjusted EPS.\nThe reduction of $0.47 or about $75 million in pretax income from the midpoint of the guidance we provided in April is at a high level, driven by the following: higher interest expense of about $13 million and weakening FX impacting income by over $8 million negatively impacted pretax income by over $21 million. The remaining about $54 million in lower pretax income is driven by the reduction in mortgage revenue with high variable margins.\nSome other factors impacting overall 2022 EBITDA margins in our July guidance relative to April guidance include an increased spending on product technology and related marketing to continue to drive NPI. International's stronger-than-expected revenue growth includes strong growth in debt management, which has somewhat lower margins and, therefore, puts margin pressure on international. And lower overall variable compensation benefits margins.\nAs I just referenced, we are continuing our investments in new product development and related marketing and sales and our data and technology cloud transformation as these are the levers driving our over 10% new product Vitality index and improved cost structure in 2023 and beyond. We will continue to tightly manage spend outside these critical growth areas.\nSlide 20 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance, which I also just discussed. At a BU level, our updated view of U.S. mortgage impacted both EWS and USIS, EWS is expected to deliver revenue growth of around 15% as strong non-mortgage growth expected to be over 40% is partially offset by the impact of the weaker mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to approach 53%, slightly lower than 2021.\nUSIS revenue is expected to be down 8.5%, reflecting the greater than 37% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. B2B non-mortgage revenue is expected to be slightly below or at the low end of our long-term framework for USIS of 6% to 8%, reflecting the decline in B2B offline discussed earlier. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 37%, reflecting the impact of the weaker mortgage market.\nInternational continues to deliver a strong year and is expected to deliver constant currency revenue growth of about 10%. International EBITDA margins are expected to be about 27%. International EBITDA margins are negatively impacted by product mix as our debt management business, which is growing strongly in 2022, has somewhat lower margins than our credit business. For the full year of 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in excess of $500 million.\nSlide 21 provides our guidance for 3Q 2022. We expect revenue in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, reflecting revenue of about flat year-to-year at the midpoint of our guidance. We're up just under 2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to full year 2022, in third quarter, we are overcoming significant revenue growth headwinds of about 17% from both the decline in the U.S. mortgage market, which is impacting revenue growth by 15% and the normalization of the unemployment claims in ERC businesses.\nCore organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis of 15% and about 4% revenue benefit from acquisitions are allowing us to overcome these headwinds and deliver constant currency growth in the quarter. 3Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to be flat to slightly down year-to-year. The flat EBITDA margins reflect the flat year-to-year revenue as well as execution of the planned cost reductions related to transformation, the benefit of which is being principally offset by year-to-year cost increases and the dilutive effect on near-term margins of the '21 and 2022 acquisitions. This impact on margins will be eliminated with time as acquisition synergies drive these margins higher.\nWe're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q 2022 of $1.60 to $1.70 per share compared to 3Q '21 adjusted EPS of $1.85 per share. The decline in adjusted EPS in 3Q 2022 year-to-year is driven by an over 15% per share negative impact on adjusted EPS of items below operating income, specifically interest expense, lost other income, principally from our Russia JV and a lower tax rate in 3Q '21 related to specific discrete items.\nAdjusting for these items and the negative impact of FX as well as the increased depreciation we are incurring related to tech transformation, adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our guidance would be about flat to 3Q '21 and consistent with flat revenue. We believe both our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance are centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provided.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Turning to Slide 22, the new Equifax is a much different business today than we were in the last recession. We're more resilient and better positioned for stronger revenue and earnings growth.\nDuring the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency we expect from a data analytics business. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue. Importantly, Workforce Solutions revenue grew throughout the period and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009 from TWN record additions and their other growth levers, which drove higher verification rates and strong unemployment revenue growth from the growing unemployment levels in 2009.\nWe believe that Equifax business mix is much better positioned for a potential economic event in the future than we were in 2009. Strong Workforce Solutions growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 16% of revenue in 2009 to almost 50% today with margins above 50%, about 20 percentage points higher than the Equifax average.\nEWS is benefiting from strong growth levers that are not directly tied to economic activity, including record growth, penetration into new, fast-growing verticals like talent and government, system-to-system integrations, deploying new and higher-value products as well as the measured price actions, taking advantage of the scale of the TWN database.\nSecond, completion of the Equifax Cloud will deliver cost savings in 2023 and beyond. We expect we'll drive about half of our targeted 500 basis point margin expansion from '22 to 2025. The cloud migration cost savings are independent of any economic event and driven by our execution.\nAnd third, we're leveraging the cloud to accelerate new product development, with a goal of 11% Vitality Index in 2022, which is over $500 million of annual incremental revenue -- new product revenue for Equifax.\nAs a reminder, new products rolled out in '21 and '22 will drive top line growth in 2023 and beyond as they mature in the marketplace. To estimate the impact of a recession that would have on Equifax, we've assigned our lines of businesses into 3 categories: first, recession growth or recession resistant. These businesses have drivers that are not directly aligned with economic activity and recession, and we expect them to grow during a recession.\nThe best examples of this are Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage, identity and fraud and our government lines of businesses that we expect will continue to grow during an economic event from the uniqueness of the data, including TWN or from low interest rate environments that impact our mortgage business.\nSecond is our countercyclical businesses that typically perform better during recession, and the best examples is our umemployment claims management business, where we expect significant growth in Workforce Solutions from growing unemployment in the U.S. or some of our account management solutions.\nAnd third, recession impacted. These are businesses that are directly impacted by economic activity and contract in a recession, and they include auto, cards, P loans or both consumer activity declines or lender activity is contracted for risk containment reasons. We expect these business lines to be flat to negative revenue growth in recession.\nToday, we believe almost 60% of our global business is recession-resilient or countercyclical. This is a big change in a strong position compared to Equifax in the 2008 global financial crisis, where only about 40% of our businesses were either recession-resistant or countercyclical.\nThe meaningful revenue growth in Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage identity and fraud since 2009, as well as the cloud transformation cost savings, position Equifax very well if there is an economic event or recession in 2023 or beyond.\nAs highlighted on Slide 23, we remain laser-focused on executing our EFX 2023 growth strategy to leverage the new EFX Cloud for innovation and new products. EFX 2023 is the foundation of our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX cloud data and technology transformation. We're now approaching 60% of total revenue being delivered from the new EFX cloud. And we've completed over 139,000 B2B migrations and over 10 million consumer migrations.\nOur international transformation is also progressing, and we continue to expect to principally complete the transition by geographic region as we move through 2023 and into 2024. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities and are confident that it will differentiate us commercially expanding our NPI capabilities, accelerating our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth in cost savings in 2022 and beyond. We remain confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics company.\nWrapping up on Slide 24, Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with 7% overall growth and 19% core growth and a 13% Vitality Index, more than offsetting a 33% decline in the mortgage market. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient, on offense and investing for future growth.\nOur updated 2022 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance reflects the impact of the expected accelerated decline in the U.S. mortgage market to a decline of over 46% in the second half of 2022, resulting in a mortgage market decline of over 30% for the year -- 37% for the year. Against this unprecedented mortgage market decline, Equifax will deliver constant currency revenue over 5% and deliver growth in adjusted EPS.\nMore importantly, our core revenue growth of 17% and non-mortgage growth of 16% are both well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and reflect the strength of the underlying Equifax business model today and in the future.\nEWS continues to deliver above-market growth and it was our largest, fastest-growing and highest-margin business. Workforce Solutions above-market 34% revenue CAGR over the last 3 years is powering Equifax growth as they approach 50% of our revenue. New products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud are also driving growth.\nOur 11% Vitality from NPIs in 2022 will drive growth in 2023 and beyond. And we're in the early days of leveraging the new Equifax Cloud to drive innovation in new products. Our 11 bolt-on acquisitions since January 2021 have expanded our capabilities and are delivering strong top line growth and will deliver synergies in 2023 and beyond.\nAnd then last, we're in the final chapters of completing our 4-year $1.5 billion transformation to the cloud that will deliver top line growth and cost benefits in 2023 and beyond. Even in these uncertain economic environment, Equifax continues to be on offense and reinvesting in the new Equifax Cloud, new products, data analytics and bolt-on M&A to drive future growth.\nWe continue to be confident in our long-term framework of 8% to 12% revenue growth, our goal of $7 billion of revenue in 2020 -- or by 2025, our ability to expand our margins 500 basis points between 2022 and 2025, and 50 basis points per year of margin expansion longer term.\nWe remain energized about our performance in 2022 in a challenging mortgage market macro and even more energized about the future of the new Equifax, a faster-growing, higher-margin cloud-native data analytics company.\nAnd with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn W. Gamble\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & COO, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and Trevor Burns, Head of Investor Relations.\nToday's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\nAlso, we will be making forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nWe will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website.\nAs a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we eliminated our GCS operating segment and moved its lines of business into Workforce Solutions, USIS and International in Canada and Europe. As a result, Equifax now has 3 operating segments. You can find reconciliations of our 2020 and 2021 prior business unit operating segment results to this new structure in the 4Q '21 earnings release Q&A.\nEquifax has a noncontrolling ownership interest in a credit bureau in Russia. We are providing no operational or financial support to the company. In the first quarter, we wrote off our investment and reflected a $19.5 million onetime charge. And beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we are no longer reflecting income from the venture. Also in the first quarter, Equifax deposited the remaining balance of $345 million into the restitution fund for the U.S. consumer class action settlement.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Equifax is off to a very strong start in 2022 and delivered a record $1.36 billion of revenue, which was up 12% and well above the levels we discussed with you in February. We continue to execute very well on delivering strong core revenue growth while delivering on our key EFX2023 strategic initiatives.\nHowever, as we look to the remainder of 2022, we are reducing our full year financial guidance, reflecting a likelihood of a much more substantial decline in the U.S. mortgage market than we expected in February. Over the past several months, mortgage rates have increased more rapidly than expected with the 30-year mortgage rate reaching over 5% last week, a 10-year high. And there's increased expectation for further increases in U.S. interest rates as we move through 2022 as the Fed manages record levels of inflation.\nAs a result, our guidance now reflects the likelihood of a much more rapid and significant decline in mortgage originations than we expected a few months ago with U.S. mortgage credit inquiries for the last 9 months of '22 declining on the order of 37.5% or 38%. Over the last half of 2022, we expect U.S. mortgage credit inquiries to be down 40%, which we believe is equivalent to mortgage originations being down more than 40% and is in line with most market forecasts, including MBA and Fannie Mae.\nThis level of mortgage market credit inquiries over the last half of 2022 is approaching 25% below the 5-year average levels we saw prior to the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 and also pulls forward the mortgage market declines we had expected in 2023 into 2022. U.S. mortgage credit inquiries in early April are beginning to show some of this weakening and are at levels somewhat weaker than we saw in the first quarter, but are not anywhere near the levels of decline we've included in our guidance.\nHowever, given the recent substantial increase in mortgage rates and expectations for further rate increases, high inflation in the war in Ukraine, our guidance reflects the much higher likelihood of a more significant decline in U.S. mortgage market as we move through the second quarter and continued significant sequential declines as we move through the balance of the year.\nWe felt it was prudent to derisk our guidance for the mortgage market and pull forward from 2023 the normalization of the mortgage market into '22. For the full year, this results in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries being down about 33.5% for the year, which is almost 10% below the 5-year average levels we saw prior to the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 and about 12 percentage points below the 21.5% decline in our February guidance. For the balance of the year, this equates to a 37.5% reduction versus the same period in 2021. And as I mentioned earlier, our run rate of 40 -- minus 40%, which is 25% below the 5-year pre-pandemic levels in the latter parts of 2022.\nThe impact on our revenue guidance of this additional 12% reduction in the mortgage market is over 350 basis points or over $175 million. We expect to offset just under half of the mortgage revenue decline with stronger core revenue growth that will now exceed 17% from stronger Workforce Solutions performance and NPI rollouts, which is an increase of about 150 basis points or $175 million for the year.\nBroadly, Equifax is operating very well with our first quarter core growth of 21%. Together, this results in a reduction in our full year revenue guidance by $100 million to a midpoint of $5.2 billion, which is still up a solid 6% after absorbing an over $500 million decline from the mortgage market.\nThe $100 million reduction in revenue and the elimination of income from our noncontrolling interest in our Russian joint venture of $0.12 a share drives our guidance for EBITDA margin expansion in '22 to about 125 basis points increase but a reduction of 50 basis points from our prior framework. This also results in guidance for our adjusted EPS to a midpoint of $8.15 a share, a reduction of $0.50 per share.\nAs I mentioned, at these levels, we still deliver solid '22 revenue growth of 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 7% despite a significant mortgage market decline impacting our revenue by almost 10.5 points or over $500 million. Our ability to deliver 17% core revenue growth reflects the underlying breadth, depth and strength of the Equifax business model and is well above our new long-term growth framework of 8% to 12%. John will provide more details on our view of the mortgage market and our guidance shortly.\nTurning to Slide 4. The first -- in the first quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance range. Revenue of $1.36 billion was up 12% with organic constant currency growth of 8% and was the highest quarterly revenue in our history and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.\nThis was delivered despite a U.S. mortgage market where credit inquiries were down 24.5% in the quarter about as expected. Core revenue growth of 21% and core organic revenue growth at 17% were both very strong and well above our new long-term financial framework. Our growth was again powered by our U.S. businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. In total, Workforce Solutions and USIS generated $1.08 billion in revenue, almost 80% of Equifax total revenue with 14% total and 7.5% organic revenue growth, again, despite the 24.5% decline in the U.S. mortgage market inquiries.\nNonmortgage U.S. revenue represented over 60% of total U.S. revenue and delivered growth of over 32% total with organic growth of just over 18%. International also delivered strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency, above the high end of their long-term framework of 7% to 9%.\nFirst quarter adjusted Equifax EBITDA totaled $484 million, up 12%. And EBITDA margins of 35.5% were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.22 a share was up a strong 13% from last year and above the guidance of $2.08 to $2.18 we provided in February, driven by strong revenue growth and progress in realizing the benefits of our cloud technology transformation.\nWe continue to accelerate our EFX Cloud data and technology transformation in the quarter, including migrating approximately an additional 10,700 customers to the cloud in the U.S. and approximately 1,500 customers internationally as well as decommissioning 2 significant data centers this month. As you may have also seen, we recently issued our second annual security report, which is another important illustration of our ESG commitment and the power of our EFX Cloud Transformation and cloud technology and data transformation. In 2018, we committed that Equifax would become an industry leader in security.\nOur latest report highlights our investments in market-leading cybersecurity capabilities and talent that enable us to detect and respond to threats with more speed and precision. We view our leading security capabilities as another competitive advantage for Equifax. Leveraging our new EFX Cloud infrastructure, we continue to accelerate new product innovations. In the first quarter, we released about 30 new products, continuing momentum from 2021, where we launched a record 151 new products. We are seeing increasing commercial traction and revenue generation from these new products, leveraging the new Equifax Cloud.\nIn the quarter, our Vitality Index, defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last 3 years, exceeded 12%. This is over a 300 basis point improvement from our 9% Vitality Index last year and the highest level for Equifax in the last decade.\nFor 2022, we now expect a Vitality Index of over 11%, up 100 basis points from the 10% guidance we provided in February, which will fuel our growth in 2022, 2023 and beyond. In the first quarter, we invested our strong free cash flow in 2 strategic bolt-on acquisitions, with a focus on accelerating growth in Workforce Solutions with the acquisition of Efficient Hire and expanding our geographic footprint with the acquisition of Data-Crédito, the largest credit bureau in the Dominican Republic.\nBolt-on acquisitions that broaden strength in Equifax are a strong lever to accelerate our growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add 100 to 200 basis points to our revenue growth from strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Even facing the macro mortgage market headwinds, we are energized by our strong start to 2022 and are clearly seeing the momentum from our EFX2023 growth strategy, leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities.\nTurning now to Slide 5. In the first quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green sections of the bars, grew a very strong 21%, which was above our expectations and substantially above our long-term framework -- financial framework of 8% to 12%. Core organic revenue growth of 17% in the quarter was also substantially above the long-term framework. Nonmortgage growth in EWS and International as well as the U.S. drove about 2/3 of our core organic revenue growth in the quarter. Strong 27% core mortgage outperformance in Workforce Solutions drove the remaining 1/3 of first quarter core organic revenue growth.\nWith our strong 21% core growth in the first quarter and accelerating NPI rollouts, we now expect 2022 core revenue growth of over 17%, which is up about 150 basis points from our February guidance and 250 basis points from our original 2022 framework. This is driven by broad-based strong performance across Workforce Solutions as well as strength in International, Kount, Identity and Fraud, Appriss Insights and accelerating NPIs.\nAs detailed on Slide 6, core mortgage revenue growth in first quarter was up a very strong 17%, driven by Workforce Solutions with their core mortgage revenue growth of 27% and 2% at USIS. Due to the strong core revenue growth, our first quarter mortgage revenue was down only 7% despite the 24.5% decline in overall U.S. mortgage market. Core mortgage growth of 27% at Workforce Solutions was consistent with our guidance in February and driven by TWN record additions, new products, increased system-to-system integrations and increased penetration.\nTurning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding core revenue growth, delivering over 40% growth for the fourth time in the last 5 quarters. This is very strong performance is driven -- this very strong performance is driven by Workforce Solutions' consistent execution across their key growth levers. First, growing the work number database. As we mentioned in February, we signed 3 new exclusive arrangements with large payroll processors late last year that we expect to implement starting in the second quarter. And we signed another new exclusive payroll processor agreement last month that we expect to also bring on board in 2022.\nWe ended the quarter with 135 million total current records, which was up 19% from last year. There are 104 million unique individuals, deliver high hit rates and represent about 65% of U.S. nonfarm payroll. The flat sequential performance from year-end was also very strong as we offset reductions of approximately 3 million records from the normal seasoning higher declines from the fourth quarter with new record additions. As of today, we're already back to over 136 million records as we have begun boarding records from one of the new exclusive payroll processor agreements we signed late last year. And as a reminder, almost 50% -- 55% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers.\nSecond, EWS is increasing penetration in their key verticals of mortgage, talent, government and consumer finance with all 4 verticals having significant opportunity for continued expansion by leveraging our expanded data hub strategy for the fast-growing talent and government markets, driving over 80% core growth in these verticals. Third, EWS is delivering increased average revenue per transaction through both higher-value new product rollouts and increasing the value or pricing of existing products by expanding the depth and breadth of our data coverage.\nAnd finally, Workforce Solutions is expanding their system to system integrations. Currently, more than 75% of our mortgage transactions are system to system, up over 2x from 2019. As you know, we get a 20%-plus lift in mortgage poles when we convert our customers from the web to system integrations. In Talent Solutions, system to system now represents more than 80% of our transactions. And last, Workforce Solutions continues to add capabilities and records through strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Over the past 2 years, we've completed 5 bolt-on acquisitions supporting EWS growth, including Appriss Insights last fall and Efficient Hire a few weeks ago.\nThe strength of Workforce Solutions and unique system value of their TWN income and employment data was clear again in the first quarter. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter with 33% revenue growth, well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework and are positioned to deliver a very strong '22 and continue above-market growth in the future.\nTurning to more details on Workforce Solutions on Slide 5. They had another exceptional quarter, delivering record revenue of $649 million, their first quarter above $600 million. Revenue growth was up a very strong 33% with organic revenue growth of 20% despite the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Core revenue growth was a very strong 45% in the quarter with core organic revenue growth of 34%. Nonmortgage is now 60% of Workforce Solutions revenue, delivering organic growth of over 30%.\nVerification Services revenue was over $500 million for the first time with strong growth driven by nonmortgage verticals that represent almost 50% of Verifier revenue and delivered 90% total and 50% organic growth. The inorganic growth was driven by the acquisition of Appriss Insights that performed very well during the quarter, driven by higher volumes, product penetration and new customer wins.\nTalent and government solutions, which now represent 30% and almost 40% of Verifier nonmortgage, respectively, both had outstanding quarters. And combined were up a very strong 100% total and over 55% organic growth. The continued expansion of the Workforce Solutions data hub and the fast-growing $5 billion talent and $2 billion government TAMs is driving strong double-digit organic growth in both verticals, leveraging Workforce Solutions' over 540 million historical records for new products.\nThe introduction of the unique Appriss Insights, National Student Clearinghouse data and other talent-related data assets strengthens our ability to deliver new solutions leveraging the EWS data hub. The nonmortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well, up 40% in the quarter. Increasing records, penetration, system-to-system integrations are driving growth in auto, card and consumer finance. And debt management grew over 25% in the quarter.\nAs mentioned earlier, mortgage revenue for Workforce Solutions was up 3% versus last year, 27 points stronger than the overall U.S. mortgage market decline and consistent with our expectations that EWS would outperform the mortgage market by approaching 30 points in 2022. Employer Services revenue of $136 million was up a strong 33% in the quarter. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of $50 million, up 6% last year but down 7% sequentially as expected. We expect total UC and ERC revenue to be down about 25% for all of 2022 driven by lower jobless claims and ERC as the COVID Federal Tax program runs out.\nEmployer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue of $86 million, up over 55% versus last year with strong organic growth of over 15%. Our I-9 business, driven by our new I-9 Anywhere product, continued to show very strong growth, up over 55%. In the first quarter, our I-9 and onboarding business made up over -- made up almost 25% of Employer Services, non-UC and ERC revenue. Our combined Health e(fx) business, which is the combination of Equifax Workforce Analytics and our Health e(fx) acquisition that we acquired in the third quarter last year, represented about 45% of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue in the quarter and delivered total growth of just under 70% with organic growth of about 1% as expected. As we discussed, the seasonality of ACA revenue was concentrated in the first half of the year.\nWorkforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.6%, consistent with the guidance we provided in February and very strong. The decline in margins versus last year was principally driven by the addition of Appriss Insights and Health e(fx). And as expected, initial margins from these acquisitions are dilutive to Workforce Solutions. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated.\nAs shown on Slide 9, continued expansion of the Workforce Solutions data hub is a key strategic focus for Workforce Solutions and the engine driving future growth in the fast-growing talent and government solution markets. Talent solutions delivered 145% total and 80% organic growth in the quarter. And we began introducing new multi-data talent products in the quarter with new product introductions expected to accelerate as we move through 2022, leveraging the Equifax Cloud.\nWe also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 89% total and 39% organic with significant new wins at the state level and continued growth of our large SSA contract. As I mentioned earlier, Appriss Insights performed very well, delivering 20% growth in the quarter from increased volumes, new customers and success with existing products. More broadly, we expect revenues from NPIs to increase as the integration of Appriss Insights continues in the back half of 2022.\nShifting now to Slide 10 in USIS. Their revenue of $433 million was down 6% compared to first quarter last year and slightly below our expectations. The decline was driven by the reduction in USIS mortgage revenue, which at $140 million is about 30% of total USIS revenue. And it was down 21% for the quarter. Positively, this was about 300 basis points stronger than the overall mortgage market decline of 24.5%. Importantly, USIS delivered their fifth consecutive quarter of growth in B2B nonmortgage revenue at $242 million, which represents over 55% of total USIS revenue and was up 4% with organic revenue growth of 2%.\nThis was somewhat lower than the mid-single-digit organic growth we discussed in February due to the timing of deal closures in their financial marketing services business. Importantly, B2B nonmortgage online revenue growth, which excludes FMS, was strong at up 10% with 6% organic growth. During the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in insurance, commercial and identity and fraud. And auto and direct-to-consumer both showed high single-digit growth. And telco and banking and lending grew in the mid-single digits.\nKount had an outstanding quarter with organic revenue growth approaching 50%. The Kount team has now delivered 2 consecutive quarters of very strong new deal bookings and along with the monetization of synergies between the Kount and Equifax customer and product base and continued vertical expansion.\nOur core new product growth continues to be very strong in Kount. And the team continues to execute on the development of joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data that we believe will drive strong growth in '22 and beyond. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business, had revenue of $46 million, down 14% from last year's 12% growth. Importantly, we continue to see growth in marketing-related projects, but our batch business was below our expectations.\nAs we discussed in the batch -- in the past, our batch or portfolio review project business can be choppy as the revenue is often driven by larger onetime off-line data licensing projects. We expect to return to growth in second quarter, driven by growth in marketing prescreen and in the portfolio review solutions inside of FMS.\nUSIS Consumer Solutions business, the U.S. D2C business from GCS that was combined with USIS in the fourth quarter, had revenue of $51 million, up 2% year-over-year, which was below our expectations. With their cloud transformation complete, the team is now focused on delivering best-in-class consumer experiences, leveraging the cloud to roll out new products and leveraging B2B relationships in traditional financial services, credit unions and new fintech players to return the business to growth.\nThe USIS sales team had a strong quarter with a number of key wins, resulting in a healthy win rate. The new deal pipeline remains very strong with the overall pipeline slightly higher than the fourth quarter. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.3% in the quarter, about flat with fourth quarter and slightly better than our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our investments and acquisitions of unique data assets are positioning U.S. for sustainable long-term nonmortgage growth. Our unique data goes far beyond traditional credit data and contains alternative data covering telco payment history, specialty finance transactions, cash flow and bank transaction, wealth data, e-commerce transactions and unique commercial business data.\nThese unique and only Equifax data sets provide scores, analytics and insights that allow lenders to increase approval rates, expand credit lines and reduce losses, particularly with underbanked consumers. These differentiated alternative data assets are an important growth lever for USIS to deliver new solutions that will help expand access to credit in the over 60 million un- and underbanked population in the United States. Earlier this week, Equifax announced a new data partnership with Fiserv, a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions, to leverage their unique data assets in combination with Equifax data to deliver new solutions to the market.\nWe intend to co-innovate with Fiserv to develop solutions that will help financial institutions and other businesses embrace the power of expanded data and real-time data insights to drive speed, account acquisition, mitigate risk and improve overall customer experience, with an initial focus on small business commercial solutions. We're very energized about our new partnership with Fiserv.\nShifting now to International on Slide 12. Their revenue of $281 million was up a very strong 10% on a local currency basis. Europe revenue was up 16%, driven principally by our U.K. debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K. government over the past several quarters that we expect to continue. As you recall in December, Equifax was awarded a 4-year extension with the U.K. on their government debt resolution contract with an estimated value of $136 million with an incremental $90 million of potential incremental sales from analytics and other CRA-related solutions. Our European CRA business was up 2% in the quarter driven by growth in identity and fraud, insurance and telco and partially offset by the U.K. direct-to-consumer business, which was below our expectations.\nAsia Pacific revenue was up 6% driven by strong growth in our Australia Commercial business, Verification Services and Identity and Fraud. Latin America was up a strong 23%, driven by double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Mexico and Central America. The team's strong new product introductions over the past 3 years and pricing actions continue to benefit growth across the region. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth for Latin America.\nCanada was up 2% and below our expectations, driven by lower volumes in consumer direct and mortgage market declines from higher interest rates. And auto was flat for the quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.4% were down 150 basis points, primarily due to the elimination of equity income from our Russian joint venture that John discussed. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margins would have been about flat with last year and slightly -- and up slightly from our expectations.\nAs shown on Slide 13, we're off to a very strong start with our new product Vitality Index over 12% in the first quarter, which is above our 10% goal for the year and the highest Vitality Index since we began tracking this measure over 10 years ago. Building on the record 151 new product introductions last year, we delivered about 30 new products so far in 2022, which is on a similar strong pace to the fourth quarter. Some of the more significant new product launches are detailed on this slide. Leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver Vitality Index in 2022 of over 11%, which equates to over $550 million of new product revenue this year. The 11% vitality is up 100 basis points from our February guidance and up 200 basis points from our strong 2021 results. NPIs are central to our long-term growth framework and driving EFX top line growth.\nAs detailed on Slide 14, reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy and our new long-term growth framework. We expect to add 1% to 2% of revenue growth each year from strategic bolt-on M&A. And we're starting '22 off strong with 2 strategic and accretive bolt-on acquisitions of Efficient Hire and Data-Crédito. Efficient Hire further strengthens Workforce Solutions by bringing expanded employer services to hospitality, building services and senior living markets. The acquisition also allows Workforce Solutions to better compete and penetrate the hourly and high-volume hiring market and, of course, provides us with incremental TWN records.\nData-Crédito is the largest consumer credit reporting agency in the Dominican Republic that adds to our strong market presence across Latin America. Since the beginning of 2021, we've completed 10 strategic bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen and broaden EFX and that fit our M&A priorities: number one, to expand and strengthen our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions; number two, to add unique data assets; number three, to expand in the fast-growing $19 billion identity and fraud space; and number four, to look to expand our global credit bureau footprint. We are well down the path of integrating the acquisitions into the EFX Cloud and driving synergies to accelerate our growth.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter and our full year 2022 guidance.\n\nJohn W. Gamble\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & COO, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. As Mark discussed earlier, we have updated our view of the U.S. mortgage market, reflecting the significant changes in current and expected future levels of U.S. interest rates.\nAs shown on Slide 15, in 2022, we are now expecting declines in U.S. mortgage credit increase of 33% in the second quarter and 40% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, which we believe is consistent with mortgage originations being down over 40% and is consistent with market forecasts.\nAs we saw in the first quarter, the decline in mortgage inquiries was less than the expected mortgage originations, we believe, driven by increased shopping by consumers as rates began to rapidly rise. We expect to see some of the same behavior but at lower levels as we move through the remainder of the year.\nAs we have shared in prior quarters, Slide 16 provides a view of both the number of home mortgages that would have a rate benefit from refinancing on the left and a view of the levels of home purchases on the right. Our updated assumptions for U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries, we believe, are consistent with the trends these charts reflect.\nThe left side of the slide provides a perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would provide a rate benefit, the in-the-money population of mortgages. The in-the-money population as of mid-April when the 30-year fixed rate was about 5% is about 3.3 million homes, down about 80% from the levels we saw in January when rates were 3.6%. As the in-the-money population declines, mortgage refi is increasingly driven by cash-out refis that are often executed with no rate benefit or a rate increase. For perspective, for Black Knight data from February 2022, about 25% of refinancings were by borrowers that had an increase in our borrowing rate.\nAs shown on the right side of Slide 16, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically high levels, about consistent with the levels we saw in 2021. Our assumptions for the U.S. mortgage market over the last 9 months of 2022 are consistent with the trends just discussed.\nWe have assumed that U.S. mortgage purchase market volume stays strong but declines in the second half by 5% to 10% from the levels we saw in 2021. We're assuming that the U.S. refinance market volume decline substantially with volume increasingly driven by cash-out refis. We expect refi volume to be down over 50% in 2Q and over 60% by 4Q with significant sequential declines in each quarter. Refinance will be about 1/3 of total mortgage volume in the second half at the lowest levels we have seen over the last 10 years.\nSlide 17 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 6.2% constant currency and 5.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.2 billion. The 33.5% decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 10.4%, over 350 basis points and $175 million more negative than the levels we discussed in February.\nWhen combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC business that we have discussed with you in February, total headwinds in 2022 revenue growth were about 11.5 percentage points. As Mark discussed earlier, core revenue growth is expected to be over 17% and up 150 basis points from the levels discussed in February. Core organic revenue growth is up 120 basis points with the remainder coming from the acquisition of Data-Crédito.\nThis stronger core revenue growth drives about $75 million in revenue benefit, offsetting just under half of the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Nonmortgage organic growth is driving almost 60% of the growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in Talent Solutions, Government and Employee Boarding Solutions, including I-9. International and USIS nonmortgage are also expected to drive core growth.\nSlide 18 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 7% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.15 per share. Revenue growth of 5.6% at our 2021 EBITDA margins of about 33.9% would deliver 8% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margin expansion of about 125 basis points is expected to drive about 6% growth in adjusted EPS. The reduction in EBITDA margin expansion by over 50 basis points from our prior guidance is driven by both the elimination of equity income from our Russian JV, which is reducing margins by over 30 basis points as well as from the negative margin impact of the net loss of $100 million of high-margin online revenue.\nWe are on track to deliver the reductions in tech transformation expenses and savings from migration to our cloud systems that we discussed with you in February. Consistent with our guidance from February, depreciation and amortization is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3%. D&A is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4 percentage points. Interest expense is higher in 2022 by about $26 million and higher than our expectation in February by about $6 million. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.7% does not assume any changes in the U.S. federal tax rate.\nSlide 19 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance, which I also just discussed. At a BU level, our updated view of U.S. mortgage impacted both EWS and USIS. EWS is expected to deliver revenue growth of about 15% as stronger nonmortgage growth, expected to be over 35%, partially offsets the impact of the weaker mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 54%. USIS revenue is expected to be down 6% to 7%, reflecting the greater 33.5% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Consistent with February, nonmortgage revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%.\nUSIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 38%, reflecting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Consistent with our February guidance, combined EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to outperform the overall market by almost 20 percentage points. And International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 7% to 9%. International EBITDA margins are expected to be up over 50 basis points. The decline from our February guidance is due to the impact of the loss of income from our Russian JV. Absent this item, our guidance for International EBITDA margins is unchanged.\nSlide 20 provides our guidance for 2Q '22. We expect revenue in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 4.4%. 2Q '22 EBITDA margins are expected to be flat to down sequentially. Looking at business units in the second quarter. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up almost 20% year-to-year with mortgage down mid-single digits and very strong nonmortgage growth continuing. EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat sequentially.\nUSIS revenue is expected to be down about 6%. Nonmortgage is expected to be up 6% to 7%, partially offsetting mortgage revenue down just over 30%. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 38%, reflecting the lower mortgage revenue. International revenue is expected to be up about 10% year-to-year in constant currency, and EBITDA margins are expected to be up slightly sequentially. Corporate expense is expected to be about flat sequentially.\nWe're expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q '22 to be $1.98 to $2.08 per share compared to 2Q '21 adjusted EPS of $1.98. We believe both our second quarter and full year 2022 guidance are centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provided.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As highlighted on Slide 21, we remain laser-focused on our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage new EFX Cloud for innovation in new products. EFX2023 is the foundation for our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework.\nWe continue to make significant progress executing the EFX data cloud and technology transformation. And we now have over half of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. This will build meaningfully in 2022 as we expect to substantially complete our North American cloud migrations. We completed over 120,000 B2B migrations, over 10 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations. In North America, our principal consumers exchanges are in production on our new cloud-based, single-data fabric and delivering to our customers.\nOur International transformation is also progressing and is expected to be principally complete by the end of 2023 with some migrations being completed in 2024. And we're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities and remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth and cost savings in 2022 and beyond. We remain on track and confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics technology company.\nAs shown on the next slide, Equifax is increasingly much more than a credit bureau and focused on faster-growing identity and fraud, talent, employer and government verticals. The consistent execution of our strategy over the past 4 years and the strategic bolt-on acquisitions we completed in '21 and so far in 2022 are all aligned with our strategy in faster-growing markets.\nIn 2022, over 50% of Equifax revenue is expected to be outside our traditional consumer and commercial credit bureau market segments, principally in Workforce Solutions and our Identity and Fraud businesses. These businesses represent about 2/3 of our $45 billion addressable markets in Identity and Fraud, Talent, Government and HR Services as well as the employment and income portions of our credit businesses with growth rates twice as fast as our traditional credit markets. As we move forward, these businesses will increasingly become larger portions of Equifax and drive our top line growth.\nAs shown on Slide 23, very strong 17% core revenue growth in '22 and 22% growth -- core growth last year is driven by our outperformance in higher-growth vertical markets. We are a different company today with over 40% of Equifax revenue delivering over 10% growth. And even more powerful are the businesses delivering over 20% growth in fast-growing markets, including Workforce Solutions, which is up 30% -- 33% in the first quarter with their talent businesses approaching up 150%, their government business up about 90%, their consumer lending business up 40% and I-9 Anywhere over 50%.\nOur Kount business in the Identity and Fraud space delivered almost 50% growth in the fast-growing market. Our Appriss Insights business was up over 20%, and our 11% NPI Vitality Index is fueling our growth. These faster-growing verticals in new markets like Talent, Government and Identity and Fraud are driving our top line and allow us to outgrow underlying market macros.\nWrapping up on Slide 24, Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with 12% overall growth and 21% core growth, more than offsetting the 25% decline in the mortgage market with broad-based performance, which was above your and our expectations. We are operating very well with strong momentum and have delivered 9 consecutive quarters of strong above-market double-digit growth, reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities.\nEquifax is resilient and on offense. We have strong momentum and are delivering the strongest results since the 2017 cyber event and arguably the strongest results in the past 10 years at Equifax. At our Investor Day last November, we discussed how the execution of our EFX2023 strategic priorities, including the Equifax data and technology cloud transformation, would lead to stronger revenue growth, faster margin expansion and higher adjusted EPS growth.\nAnd as you know, we introduced the new long-term financial framework with total revenue growth of 8% to 12%, including 100 to 200 basis points of growth from bolt-on acquisitions. We also expect to deliver margin expansion of 50 basis points per year over the long term that will help us deliver adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 16%, which, combined with our 1% dividend yield target, will allow us to deliver total return to shareholders of 13% to 18%.\nThe rapidly changing and unprecedented environment makes forecasting the impacts of the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We do not take guidance changes lightly, but we felt it was prudent to derisk the year by reducing our U.S. mortgage market credit inquiry outlook to down 37.5% for the balance of the year, resulting in a full year decline of 33.5% in our mortgage market.\nThis includes a decline in the mortgage market of 40% in the back half of '22, which is approaching 25% below the 5-year run rate levels from prior to 2020 and pulls forward the market declines we had expected in 2023 into 2022. We also believe this equates to mortgage originations being down more than 40% in the back half of 2022, which is aligned with most market estimates. We feel this is a prudent and balanced framework, given the unprecedented macro environment.\nAgainst the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient and continues to deliver strong results. Our updated outlook delivers 6% growth, offsetting more than $500 million, over 10% of mortgage market decline with strong core revenue growth of 17% in 2022, which is up 150 basis points from our February guide and over 250 basis points from the framework we shared with you at our Investor Day in November. Our ability to offset the 33.5% decline in the mortgage market and delivered 6% total growth driven by 17% core growth is powerful.\nLooking back at the '08, '09 global financial crisis, which is the last time we saw a macro event like this impacting the mortgage market. Equifax revenue was down 6% versus the 6% growth we will deliver in our 2022 framework. We're a different company today, a more diverse, resilient, faster growing, higher margin, higher free cash flow company, a new Equifax with stronger growth levers.\nWorkforce Solutions is our strongest and fastest-growing business and will be north of 45% of our revenue in 2022 with a run rate -- runway to move past 50% of Equifax revenue in the near future. Their 33% growth in the first quarter is over 4x the growth rate of the rest of Equifax. And their 55% EBITDA margins are over 15 points above our average and highly accretive to Equifax.\nWorkforce Solutions has multiple levers to deliver their 13% to 15% long-term growth rate, which is highly accretive to Equifax. Our core nonmortgage market growth is very strong at 21% in the first quarter and 17% in our new 2022 guidance, and above our new 8% to 12% long-term framework. We think about core revenue growth as a strong indicator of the breadth, depth and strength of the underlying Equifax business model.\nWe expect our mortgage teams will continue to outperform the market decline by almost 20 percentage points in 2022, consistent with our February guide with Workforce Solutions outperforming by approximately 30 points from pricing, NPIs, new TWN records, new customers and system-to-system integrations. And as you know, we're in the early days of leveraging the 50% of Equifax that's now in the Equifax Cloud environment. And we're just starting to realize the top and bottom line benefits from the cloud.\nAs we move over the coming months and quarters to be fully cloud native, the top and bottom line benefits will really kick in over the next 2 to 3 years and drive our top line while enabling us to achieve our 2025 margin goal of 39%. And as we talked on the call this morning, we're ramping our new product capabilities, leveraging our differentiated data assets in the Equifax Cloud.\nOur Vitality Index in 2022 will now be 11% over $500 million, which is up 9% last year and 100 basis points from our start in 2021. NPIs are fueling our growth. And last, our 10 bolt-on acquisitions in the last 15 months are adding $375 million to our run rate revenue. But more importantly, the M&A synergies will be kicking in during 2022 and 2023 as we complete our integrations and drive our NPI rollouts.\nTo be clear, we believe Equifax continues to operate at a very high level. There's no change in our long-term outlook for Equifax. The change in our mortgage market framework simply pulls forward the market normalization into 2022. We remain confident in our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and 50 basis points a year of long-term margin expansion that we rolled out at our Investor Day in November. And there's no change to our 2025 goal of $7 billion of revenue and 500 basis points of margin expansion to reach EBITDA margins of 39%.\nWe're a new Equifax, a more resilient, more diverse, higher-growth and higher-margin company. I'm energized by our strong first quarter performance but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax.\nI'd like to close by welcoming Trevor Burns back to the Equifax leadership -- senior leadership team. We announced earlier this week that Dorian Hare has taken another position outside of Equifax, and we wish him well. And we'd like to thank Dorian for his service leading Investor Relations for the past 2 years. Trevor will now reassume the lead responsibilities for Investor Relations effective immediately.\nAnd with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDorian Hare\n\nSVP of Corporate IR, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com.\nDuring today's call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call.\nAlso, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to materially -- differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nWe will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website.\nIn 4Q 2021, Equifax incurred a restructuring charge of $8.6 million or $0.05 a share. This charge was for costs principally incurred to reduce technology development expense as we complete the Equifax data and cloud transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income and adjusted EPS.\nAs we have previously discussed, in July 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the U.S. consumer class action litigation arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident. That settlement agreement has been the subject of numerous court appeals.\nOn January 10, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the last remaining petitions seeking to appeal, and the settlement agreement became effective as of January 11, 2022. In January, we deposited the remaining $345 million into the consumer restitution fund, and the claims administrator will begin to validate consumer claims.\nAs a result, in the fourth quarter, we eliminated -- excuse me, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we eliminated our GCS operational segment and moved its lines of business into Workforce Solutions, USIS and International in Canada and Europe. As a result, Equifax now has 3 operating segments.\nIn our remarks today, we will discuss 2021 and fourth quarter results as well as our 2022 guidance focused on this new structure, unless we indicate otherwise. For your reference, we have included in our 4Q '21 earnings release Q&A reconciliations of our 2020 and 2021 prior business unit operating segment results to this new structure.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Dorian, and good morning. Before I get to our strong fourth quarter results, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the tremendous progress and outstanding results we delivered last year.\nAs shown on Slide 4, our financial performance in 2021 was very strong and built off an equally strong 2020. Revenue was up 19% with organic local currency revenue growth of 15% and core nonmarket growth of 22%, all well above our new 8% to 12% long-term financial framework, reflecting the strength of the new Equifax growth model.\nAdjusted EPS at $7.64 was up 10% and adjusted for the change in treatment of transformation expenses in '21 was up a strong 24%. This is truly an outstanding year, substantially stronger than we expected when we started 2021 and despite a U.S. mortgage market that was down more than we expected at 7.5%.\nWe delivered 8 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and 2 years of strong above-market performance with 17% growth in 2020 and 19% growth last year. Workforce Solutions delivered a milestone with revenue over $2 billion for the first time, up 39% with organic revenue growth of 34%. And the business is up 2x from their 2019 revenue of $915 million. This was again driven by very strong performance in Verification Services, with revenue up 46% and organic revenue growth of 41%.\nActive records on the work number grew by a very strong 22 million records or 19% to 136 million records at the end of the year. Mortgage revenue was up 41%, almost 50 percentage points stronger than the underlying market. And nonmortgage revenue in Verification Services had organic growth of 41% driven by talent solutions with organic growth of over 100%.\nUSIS also had a strong year. Nonmortgage revenue was up 16% with organic growth of 10%. Total revenue was up 4% with organic revenue growth of 2% despite the 7.5% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. In total, our U.S. businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 80% of Equifax revenue, delivered 20% total and 17% organic growth with nonmortgage revenue growth of over 21% total and 15% organic, again, all well above our new long-term framework of 8% to 12%.\nInternational also delivered a milestone in 2021 with their first year of revenues over $1 billion. Revenue grew 10% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America.\nIn 2021, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 5, grew a very strong 22% with fourth quarter revenue growth also a very strong 18%, both substantially above the new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. Core organic revenue growth in 2021 was 18% and 13% in the fourth quarter, again, above our long-term framework.\nNonmortgage organic growth in Workforce Solutions and USIS and growth in International drove almost 9% on core organic revenue growth in 2021 and over 8% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX. Mortgage outperformance, primarily in EWS, drove the remaining 9% in 2021 and 5% in fourth quarter, respectively, of core organic revenue growth.\nAs we move through '22 and '23, we expect to see continued strong and balanced core growth, reflecting the benefits of the -- from the strength of Workforce Solutions, new Equifax Cloud and accelerated NPIs. And we expect continued strong nonmortgage performance from both organic growth and acquisitions as well as continued strong mortgage outperformance from Workforce Solutions.\nSlide 6 covers our strong fourth quarter performance. Revenue at $1.25 billion was up 12% with organic constant currency growth of 6.6% despite a decline in the U.S. mortgage market of 21%, which was off a strong 23% growth a year ago in the fourth quarter. As I discussed earlier, core revenue growth was a very strong 18% in the quarter with core organic growth of 13% again driven by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions.\nFourth quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $403 million, slightly higher than expected. EBITDA margins of 32.2% were consistent with our expectations. The decline in margins versus last year was primarily due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of $47 million in our adjusted results in the fourth quarter, which were excluded last year. Adjusting for these costs, our margins were 35.9%. John will provide more -- a more detailed discussion on our '22 margins in a few minutes and the drivers of our up to 200 basis point margin expansion in 2022 that we're targeting.\nAdjusted EPS of $1.84 per share was above the high end of our guidance range. As expected, adjusted EPS was down from last year and reflected the inclusion of cloud transformation costs of $47 million or $0.30 a share in our adjusted results in the quarter, which were excluded last year. Excluding these costs, adjusted EPS would have been up 7.1%, about consistent with our organic revenue growth.\nThe acquisitions completed in 2021 were slightly accretive to adjusted EPS. And we expect substantial acceleration and accretion in '22 and '23 from the acquisitions as we complete the integrations.\nWorkforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $532 million with reported revenue growth of 29% and organic revenue growth of 17%. And this, of course, was delivered despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market in the fourth quarter and against very strong 61% revenue growth that they delivered last year in the fourth quarter.\nNonmortgage revenue was up almost 50% with organic nonmortgage revenue up about 25%. Included in Workforce Solutions fourth quarter results is about $7 million from ID Watchdog, which was previously a part of GCS and is now part of Employer Services business in EWS. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their twin income and employment data was clear again in the fourth quarter. EWS is clearly our fastest-growing business and powering our results.\nVerification Services revenue in the quarter was $427 million, up 29%, with organic growth of almost 17%. The revenue from our Appriss Insights acquisition is included in Verification Services. Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 6% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market with the Workforce Solutions outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products.\nVerification Services nonmortgage revenue represented just over half of total Verification Services revenue in the quarter. Total Verifier nonmortgage revenue was up almost 65%, reflecting strong 30% organic revenue growth plus the addition of Appriss Insights in October. Nonmortgage organic revenue growth of 30% was very strong, particularly over last year's fourth quarter, which was up 15%.\nOur government vertical with the addition of Appriss Insights provides a broad set of solutions to federal, state and local governments. These include solutions in support of government assistance programs, including food and rental support as well as the VINE victims notification service and other law enforcement solutions acquired as a part of Appriss Insights. The government vertical represented about 40% of total nonmortgage verification revenue in the quarter and delivered 25% total and over 15% organic revenue growth.\nOrganic growth was driven by the continued growth in the work number and the continued expansion of state benefit programs. We also continue to see a ramp in volume for our new -- from our new Social Security Administration contract that went live last quarter. And we expect to see significant growth in volume as we move towards run rate levels through 2022.\nTalent solutions, which provides income, employment, educational background and medical certification verifications, incarceration, criminal background, medical sanctions and other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our EWS Data Hub, had another outstanding quarter. The addition of Appriss Insights in October, educational information from the National Student Clearinghouse in August and significant growth in the work number during the quarter substantially expanded the EWS Data Hub, supporting continued customer expansion and new products.\nTotal talent solutions revenue represented about 40% of Verifier nonmortgage revenue in the quarter with total growth of almost 100% and organic growth of 50%. As you know, over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of that hiring process. We've seen both the number and the frequency of job changes increasing in the current environment. Our ongoing addition of new data assets to the EWS Data Hub will enhance new product growth in this important vertical in the future.\nThe nonmortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well, up over 50% in the quarter. Debt management with nonmortgage consumer lending grew over 30% in the quarter.\nEmployer Services revenue of $105 million was up 28% in the quarter. And as you know, this is an important growth engine for Workforce Solutions that also delivers new twin records. Combined, our unemployed -- our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $54 million, up slightly from last year but down over 15% sequentially as we expected. Substantial declines in UC revenue in the quarter were offset by growth in ERC revenue, which, as a reminder, is our business that supports employers obtaining federal employee retention credits.\nEmployer Services non-UC and non-ERC businesses had revenue of about $50 million, up 60% versus last year with organic revenue growth of about 35%. Our I-9 business, driven by our new I-9 Anywhere solution, continued to show very strong growth, up over 50%. In the fourth quarter, our I-9 business made up about 40% of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue.\nIn August, we acquired Health e(fx), which provides services to employers to help them ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act, which we are now combining with our existing workforce analytics business. This combined workforce analytics business represented about 25% of employer non-UC and ERC revenue in the quarter.\nWorkforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.6% for 2021 and have been consistently in the mid-50s over the past 2 years. As John will discuss later, we expect Workforce Solutions margins to be at or above the 54.6% delivered in 2021 in both the first quarter and in 2022.\nAs we expected, fourth quarter '21 EBITDA margins in Workforce were 48.4% and were lower than those levels -- than our historic levels due to 3 factors. First, Appriss Insights and Health e(fx) negatively impacted margins. As expected, initial margins from these acquisitions are dilutive to Workforce Solutions. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated.\nSecond, in the fourth quarter, EWS ramped one major and several smaller payroll processor record contributions to our Verifier database as well as integrated other data contributors to the data hub. As we discussed in the past, in the quarters where this occurs, we incur incremental costs related to boarding and ramping the new contributors. And as we've indicated, fourth quarter saw substantial new record additions, and these in-period costs impacted margins in the quarter.\nAnd third, our cloud transformation cost negatively impacted margins by about 200 basis points. Workforce substantially completed the Verifier cloud-native migration in the fourth quarter, so these costs will decline substantially going forward.\nWe remain confident that Workforce Solutions margins will recover in 2022 and be above the 54.6% we saw in 2021. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding year and are well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continue their above-market growth. EWS is our fastest-growing and highest-margin business.\nUSIS had revenue of $434 million, which was about flat with the fourth quarter with the mortgage market down significantly and includes $47 million of USIS consumer revenue previously part of GCS, which was just about flat. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $126 million was down 18% in the quarter, while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21%, about consistent with the expectations we shared in October. Outperformance versus the overall market was driven by stronger growth in mortgage solutions, including growth in services.\nNonmortgage nonconsumer solutions revenue of $262 million grew almost 12% with organic revenue growth of almost 6%. In the fourth quarter, insurance continued to deliver double-digit growth. Commercial and identity and fraud were up single digits and FI, auto and telco were up low to mid-single digits. And direct-to-consumer increased over 10% in the quarter.\nFor the full year, nonmortgage nonconsumer solutions revenue was up a strong 16% with organic growth in this category of about 10%. For 2021, USIS delivered double-digit organic growth across FI, insurance, identity and fraud and D2C as well as mid- to high single-digit growth in commercial and auto and telco declined slightly.\nFinancial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking our off-line and batch business, had revenue of about $79 million, our highest quarterly revenue in history. This was up about 14% in the quarter. The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20%. Both risk and ID and fraud revenue were up about 10%.\nIn 2021, marketing-related revenue, which grew more than 20% in each quarter, represented about 40% of FMS revenue, identity and fraud above 20 and risk decisioning above 30. The USIS commercial team delivered record wins, up over 25% versus last year and 5% sequentially in the fourth quarter. Their new deal pipeline remains very strong with overall -- with the overall type slightly higher than the third quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.4% in the quarter, up over 50 basis points sequentially from third quarter.\nThe decline from the fourth quarter in 2020 was principally driven by 2 factors. First, the acquisitions of Kount and Teletrack negatively impacted margins in the period. As expected, initial margins for these acquisitions are dilutive to USIS. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated.\nAnd second, cloud transformation costs negatively impacted margins by almost 75 basis points. As with EWS, these costs are expected to decline as we move through 2022. In 2022, we expect USIS margins to be flat to slightly below the almost 40% level we delivered in 2021.\nInternational revenue of $288 million was up 6% and over 7.5% sequentially on a local currency basis. Included in International in the fourth quarter was almost $25 million of consumer solutions revenue in Canada and the U.K. that was formerly part of GCS, which was down about 6% versus last year. The lower growth in the consumer revenue in the fourth quarter was in Europe, which we expect to recover to high single-digit growth in the first quarter.\nAsia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, performed very well in the quarter with revenue of $88 million, up about 9% in local currency. Australia and New Zealand consumer revenue remained flat versus last year. Our ANZ commercial business combined online and off-line revenue was up 9% in the quarter. And our HR verifications business in Australia was up a strong 37%.\nEuropean revenues of $90 million were about flat in local currency in the quarter, but up over 20% sequentially. As a reminder, Europe had a very strong baseline from the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by the reactivation of debt services in the U.K. and large electronic notifications volume in Spain, a consequence of a change in legislation. Our European credit reporting business, which is about 2/3 of European revenue, was impacted by COVID lockdowns in the U.K. and up about 2%.\nCommercial data off-line and analytics and scores saw strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And consumer credit reporting offerings grew high single digit as lockdown measures eased. Included in the U.K. credit reporting business was $7 million from consumer solutions. Our European debt management business revenue was up over 30% sequentially but down 5% versus a very strong fourth quarter 2020.\nIn December, Equifax was awarded a new 5-year extension of the U.K. government debt resolutions tender, a debt collections contract with an estimated contract value of $136 million with an incremental $90 million upside from sales of analytics and other CRA-related solutions. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K. government over the past several quarters that we expect should deliver strong growth in debt management revenue in the first half of 2022 for our U.K. business.\nCanada delivered revenue of $64 million in the quarter, up 6% in local currency despite a weakening Canadian mortgage market that was down 4%. Canada experienced strong growth in analytics and decisioning solutions with strong growth in fintech and traditional FI, while supply issues continue to impact their auto business. Included in Canada revenue is $16 million of consumer solutions revenue.\nLatin American revenues of $45 million were up a strong 15% in the quarter in local currency, which was their fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Strong new product introductions over the past 3 years and pricing actions continue to benefit growth across our Latin American region.\nInternational adjusted EBITDA margins at 29.9% were up 320 basis points sequentially mainly due to stronger revenue and positive mix. Margins were down year-to-year due to costs related to the cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and the inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs, which were being excluded in 2020. Excluding these costs, margins were down slightly versus last year.\nTurning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding performance and is clearly our strongest and fastest-growing and most valuable business. As mentioned earlier, core revenue growth was up 38% in the quarter and 42% for the year with core organic revenue growth of 28% in the quarter and 38% for the full year of 2021.\nThese strong results were driven by the uniqueness of our TWN income and employment data, the scale of the TWN database and continued expansion of new products and markets driven by outstanding consistent execution by Rudy and his team. 2021 growth of 39% is well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework, which we shared with you in November and of course, is on top of 51% delivered -- growth delivered in 2020.\nEWS' ability to consistently and substantially outgrow their underlying markets is driven by 3 factors. First, growing the work number TWN database. At the end of the fourth quarter, TWN reached 136 million active records, an increase of 19% or 22 million records from a year ago and included 105 million unique individuals, which is almost 70% of U.S. nonfarm payroll.\nThis increase in records makes our TWN database more valuable to our customers from both higher hit rates and more complete employment histories. We are now receiving records every pay period from 2.5 million companies, up from 1 million companies when we started 2021 and 27,000 contributors a short 2-plus years ago.\nOur strong momentum continued during the fourth quarter with the signing of 3 new exclusive agreements with major payroll processors that we expect to implement during 2022. As a reminder, almost 55% of our records are contributed directly by employers where EWS provides comprehensive employer services like UC claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, ERC, ACA and other HR and compliance solutions.\nOur acquisitions of HIREtech, i2verify, Health e(fx) and now Efficient Hire, which we announced earlier this week, strengthen our ability to deliver these employer services both directly and through relationships with payroll processors and HR software companies, and of course, expand our TWN database. We still have substantial room to grow our TWN income and employment database and expect to continue to add new direct contributors as well as the additional -- addition of payroll processors and software partners on an exclusive basis to TWN in 2022.\nBeyond just the -- just under 50 million nonfarm payroll records not yet in the TWN database, we've expanded our focus to data records from the 40 million to 50 million gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the United States marketplace to further broaden and strengthen the TWN database.\nYou probably saw we also announced an expansion of our global footprint for Workforce Solutions with the launch of our new U.K. income and employment verification platform. This adds to our existing Australia, Canada and India EWS business launches outside the United States. We've got plenty of room to grow TWN.\nSecond growth lever for Workforce Solutions is increasing average revenue per transaction through new products and pricing our existing products to value, recognizing the depth of information TWN allows us to deliver to customers. Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is rapidly expanding as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax cloud capabilities.\nAnd the third growth lever is by increasing penetration in the markets we serve and expanding into new markets and new verticals. For example, we continue to increase our penetration of the mortgage market.\nWorkforce Solutions received an inquiry for over 60% of combined mortgages, up from 55% in early 2020. We have significant runway to grow penetration in the mortgage vertical. We are also in the early stages of penetrating the talent market where today, we receive inquiries in about 1 in 10 hires in the United States, plenty of room for growth.\nGrowing system-to-system integration is another key growth lever in driving both increased penetration and increasing the number of [pulls] per transaction. During the quarter, about 76% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system to system, up over 2x from the 32% in 2019, another great growth lever for Workforce Solutions.\nWorkforce Solutions is performing exceptionally well with attractive above-market and above-Equifax growth rates and is highly accretive margins that we expect to power workforce -- power Equifax growth in the future.\nSlide 8 highlights core mortgage revenue growth performance of our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Mortgage revenue grew 19% in 2021 in a down 7.5% market and off 80% revenue growth in 2020. Our combined U.S. B2B businesses outperformed the market -- the mortgage market by 28 points in 2021 and 16 points in the fourth quarter. This was driven by Workforce Solutions as they outperformed the underlying mortgage market by 51 points for the year and 27 points in the fourth quarter. John will cover our updated mortgage market outlook in a few minutes.\nWe've reduced our outlook -- mortgage outlook for 2021 -- 2022 to down 21.5% versus our prior view of down 15%, reflecting the likely impact of higher interest rates. We expect to offset a large portion of that impact with stronger growth -- stronger core mortgage revenue growth from EWS, from the strong TWN record additions, new products, system-to-system integrations and penetration.\nWe now expect EWS will outperform the U.S. mortgage market by approximately 30 points, up 700 basis points from our prior view and our combined U.S. B2B businesses of USIS and EWS to outperform the U.S. mortgage market by an amount approaching 20 points, which is up 400 basis points from our prior view.\n2021 was a very strong year for new product innovation and a key priority of our team. As shown on Slide 9, we delivered a record 151 new products, up from 134 last year -- I'm sorry, in 2020 and a Vitality Index of just under 9%, which is our highest vitality that we've achieved since 2018 and stronger than our 8% expectations when we started 2021.\nOur pace accelerated in the fourth quarter as we delivered 36 new products, positioning us well for 2022. In the fourth quarter, we launched significant new products we expect to drive growth in 2022 and beyond.\nThe EWS talent report education product provides all available postsecondary degrees instantly sourced from the National Student Clearinghouse via an exclusive Equifax ordering experience using a single SSN number input. This enhanced offering helps deliver a more efficient hiring process and the ability to make better informed hiring decisions with a holistic candidate view.\nWorkforce Solutions' priority next-day VOE and priority 2-day VOE products are our quick and seamless manual solutions that deliver verification of employment on the next business day or second business day following a client's request. These solutions are available to both our web and integrated clients and provide complete coverage when combined with our instant verification of employment solutions from TWN.\nThe My Equifax Allow Access product, launched by USIS, allows consumers to be notified instantly when they submit an application to a participating lender that their file is frozen and with a few easy steps can unlock their files so their loan can be processed. And this is a win-win for both the lender and the consumer.\nThe spending power and affluence index products, also launched by US, were introduced as new marketing targeting tools that utilize proprietary data to identify customers and prospects with the greatest capacity to spend on new products or services. Spending power estimates dollars available to spend after accounting for cost of living expenses while the affluence index provides a score that differentiates households based on spending power and credit utilization.\nAnd then last, we continue to help our clients automate smarter digital customer acquisition decisions by enabling access to new data sources. Through the ID Matrix Enhancements in Australia, our clients can simultaneously identify previously undetected risk based on e-mail metadata and assess financial eligibility for a loan based on Australian residency status.\nLeveraging our new Equifax cloud capability to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index in 2022 of over 10%, which equates to over $500 million of revenue in 2022 from new products introduced in the past 3 years. The 10% vitality is up over 100 basis points from our strong 2021 new product results and aligns with our new long-term growth framework we provided at our Investor Day in November.\nTurning to Slide 10. USIS is leading the industry in offering flexible structure for BNPL providers to report consumer credit data onto the Equifax U.S. credit exchange through BNPL-specific business industry codes. This new capability will provide Equifax customers and partners the flexibility to include the fast-growing BNPL data in credit decisioning or to exclude it based on their specific needs.\nOur new Equifax cloud gives us the ability to quickly ingest and manage diverse data types and develop customer reports through Equifax One and custom scores using Equifax decisioning. Our data ingestion process is simplified by the new Equifax cloud, and time to market for products has substantially accelerated. As we move through 2022, you'll see this capability further accelerate our NPI-based revenue growth.\nBefore I turn it over to John, I wanted to quickly discuss our guidance expectations for 2022. In October, we shared with you a framework for 2022 that included a midpoint revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.65 per share.\nAs discussed earlier, several factors have impacted our view of 2022 compared to the framework we shared with you a few months ago. First, expectations for the U.S. mortgage market have changed meaningfully given the jump in the 30-year mortgage rates from 3% in September to 3.6% today. We now expect the U.S. mortgage market to decline 21.5% in 2022 as opposed to the 15% decline we expected back in October.\nOn its own, the 650 basis point further decline in the mortgage market negatively impacts our revenue by over $100 million. And offsetting that, we expect Equifax core revenue growth should reach 16% in 2022, over 200 basis points higher than what we reviewed with you in October. This is principally driven by the strong outperformance from Workforce Solutions, including the accelerated pace of new TWN record additions and the faster new product rollouts.\nThis higher core revenue growth drives just over $100 million of additional revenue, offsetting the impact of the additional 650 basis points of mortgage market decline. Our strong core growth allows us to hold our 2022 guidance at the same level as the '22 framework we shared with you in October with our expectation that we will be at the midpoint of our '22 guidance for revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.65 per share.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our '22 guidance and assumptions and also provide our guidance for the first quarter. We're starting off strong in 2022, given our momentum from the fourth quarter.\n\nJohn W. Gamble\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Equifax Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before we discuss 2022, I'll share a little more detail on 4Q '21. In 4Q '21, items below operating income, specifically net interest and other expenses and effective tax rate, came in combined slightly weaker than expected. Net interest and other expense was slightly weaker than we expected, and our 22% effective tax rate was very close to the guidance we provided.\nAs Mark referenced earlier, Equifax EBITDA margins came in as expected in the fourth quarter at 32.2%. The factors resulting in the year-to-year decline were considered in the guidance we shared in October. Specifically, 2/3 of the decline was driven by the treatment of cloud technology transformation costs in 2021, including them in our adjusted results. Remaining 1/3 of the decline is driven by the items Mark discussed earlier, specifically the impact on Workforce Solutions and USIS of the acquisitions completed in 2021 and the increased royalty costs.\nAs Mark discussed, regarding the acquisitions, we expect to deliver synergies that will support higher EBITDA margins as we move through 2022 and '23. And the higher royalties at Workforce Solutions were partially driven by cost related to the start-up of the significant new payroll partners launched in the second half of 2021.\nAs I will discuss in detail in a moment, we expect 1Q 2022 Workforce Solutions margins to return to exceed 55% and overall, Equifax EBITDA margins to return to approach 35.5%, up about 325 basis points sequentially.\nLet's start with more detail on our assumptions for the U.S. mortgage market. As shown on Slide 11, in 2022, we are expecting a 21.5% year-to-year decline in the U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries. With a more rapid increase in the U.S. mortgage market rates we have seen in the first quarter, reaching 3.6% last week, consistent with the increase in the U.S. 10-year and reduced Fed purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, we expect refinancing activity to drop more substantially beginning as early as late in the first quarter. 2022 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries would need to decline an additional just under 5% from 2021 levels to return to average levels we saw over the 2015 to 2019 period.\nThe left side of Slide 12 provides perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would be beneficial. We have expanded this chart from versions we shared in prior quarters to provide greater perspective on the full in-the-money population of mortgages.\nAs we've discussed in prior quarters, in rising mortgage rate environments, refinancings will often occur with lower levels of rate benefit. This is increasingly true during periods of high home price appreciation as homeowners look to borrow against their increasing levels of home equity.\nLooking at data from late January, at current mortgage rate levels, there are over 16 million homes that would benefit from a refinancing. Of this amount, about 7.8 million mortgages that have a loan to value at 80% or below and for which the borrower has a 660 or above credit score would see their mortgage rate decline by 75 basis points or more.\nThere's an additional 5.3 million that have an LTV of 70% or below that would see their mortgage rate decline by 25 to 75 basis points. And there are another just over 3 million that have an LTV of 70% or below that would benefit by up to 25 basis points from refinancing.\nAlthough down significantly from the levels we saw earlier in 2021 when mortgage rates were around 3%, this remains a significant population similar to the levels we saw in 2009 and about 15% below what we saw in 2016. For perspective, per Black Knight data during 4Q '21, over 35% of refinancings were by borrowers benefiting by a rate decrease of less than 75 basis points. Based upon our most recent data from July 2021, mortgage refinancings were just about 600,000 per month.\nAs shown on the right side of Slide 12, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. Our 2022 assumption for U.S. mortgage credit inquiries is that we will see these high levels of purchase mortgage financings continue at levels slightly above the levels we saw in 2021. And that refinancings will decline significantly from the levels we saw in both 2020 and 2021.\nSlide 13 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 8.4% constant currency and 7.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.3 billion. Using current FX rates, FX is a negative impact on 2022 growth of just over 0.8%, about 0.2 percentage points weaker than we discussed in October.\nTotal revenue of $5.3 billion is up almost 8% from 2021 and in line with the framework we provided in October. The 21.5% more -- decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 6.6%, about 200 basis points or just over $100 million more negative than the levels we discussed in October.\nWhen combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC business, total headwinds to 2022 revenue growth are about 8 percentage points. Core organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis is anticipated to be over 13%. This is almost 200 basis points higher than we discussed in October with this improvement driven by Workforce Solutions through the much stronger record growth and accelerating NPI and strong pricing driving higher average unit revenues that Mark discussed earlier.\nNonmortgage organic growth is driving over 7% of the growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. USIS nonmortgage and international are also expected to drive core growth.\nMortgage revenue outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is expected to drive the remaining almost 6% of the core -- of the organic core growth. This is driven by strong outperformance in Workforce Solutions.\nThe acquisitions completed in 2021, plus the Efficient Hire acquisition closed earlier this week, are expected to contribute about 3.2 percentage points of growth to 2022. Core revenue growth, excluding FX, of almost 16.5% is well above our long-term framework and 200 basis points higher than we discussed in October due to the stronger core organic growth in Workforce Solutions and our good start to the year and acquisitions. This stronger core revenue growth drives just over $100 million in revenue benefit, offsetting the impact of the weaker mortgage market.\nSlide 14 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 13% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.65 per share. This is in line with the midpoint of the 2022 framework we shared in October.\nEBITDA margins are still expected to increase in the 175 to 200 basis point range we discussed in October. Revenue growth of 7.6% at our 2022 EBITDA margins of about 33.9% would deliver about 10% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margin expansion of 175 to 200 basis points is expected to drive 9% growth in adjusted EPS.\nDepreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $40 million in 2022, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3%. D&A is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production.\nThe combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects increased debt from the 2021 acquisitions and the higher short-term interest rates I've referenced. Interest rates -- the interest expense is higher than our expectation in October by about $7 million. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.5% does not assume any changes to the U.S. federal tax rate.\nSlide 15 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2017 through 2022. We anticipate delivering strong core revenue growth of 16%, reflecting organic growth of 13% and a 3% benefit from acquisitions completed in 2021 plus Efficient Hire.\nSlide 16 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance. 2022 revenue of between $5.25 billion and $5.35 billion reflects growth of about 6.6% to 8.7% versus 2021, including a 0.8% negative impact from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 3.2%.\nEWS is expected to deliver over 15% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be up from the 54.6% delivered in 2021. USIS revenue is expected to be about flat, reflecting the 21.5% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Nonmortgage revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%.\nUSIS EBITDA margins are expected to be slightly down from the 39.9% delivered in 2021. Combined EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to be down slightly with mortgage outperformance approaching 20%. And International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 7% to 9%. International EBITDA margins are expected to expand by over 175 basis points.\n2022 adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $8.80 per share is up 11.2% to 15.2% from 2021. Given the greater decline of the U.S. mortgage market we discussed earlier, we believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges.\nThe 175 to 200 basis point improvement in our 2022 EBITDA margin from the 33.9% in 2021 is principally driven by the following main factors. Workforce Solutions revenue growth of over 15% with margins at or above their current 54.6% drives a benefit to overall Equifax EBITDA margins of over 150 basis points.\nCorporate expense as a percentage of revenue is declining year-to-year on higher overall Equifax revenue, improving overall Equifax EBITDA margin by on the order of 100 basis points. The drivers of the lower spend are principally lower corporate technology transformation expense and lower variable comp.\nInternational margin expansion of over 175 basis points also drives about 25 basis points in overall Equifax EBITDA margin. These are partially offset by the negative impact on overall Equifax EBITDA margins of flat USIS revenue in 2022 due to the very weak mortgage market.\nSlide 17 provides our guidance for 1Q '22. We are starting 2022 strong, better than previously expected. We expect revenue in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.34 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 8.8% to 10.5%, including a 1.2% negative impact from FX.\nThe U.S. mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries is expected to be down approximately 24%. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by about 5.2%.\n1Q '22 EBITDA margins are expected to approach 35.5%, up about 325 basis points sequentially. The improvement is driven by the same 2 factors we discussed driving the improvement in our full year 2022 EBITDA margins.\nLooking at the business units in the first quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue is expected to be up over 25% year-to-year, and EBITDA margins are expected to be over 55% driven by significant growth in Verifier and seasonally strong Workforce Analytics revenue. Workforce Solutions will represent about 47% of Equifax revenue in the quarter.\nUSIS revenue is expected to be down 3% to 4% year-to-year driven by the 24% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. The mortgage decline is partially offset by growth in nonmortgage expected to be up mid-single-digit percentage. EBITDA margins will be down slightly sequentially from 4Q '21 due to the weak mortgage market. International revenue is expected to be up about 8% year-to-year in constant currency.\nAnd EBITDA margins are expected to be down about 100 basis points year-to-year. The decline in EBITDA margin is driven by increased cost in Canada as we migrate our Canadian credit exchange to be in production on data fabric in the quarter and some negative mix from growth in debt management. As I just indicated, full year EBITDA margins for International should increase 175 basis points year-to-year.\nCorporate expense will decline year-to-year, benefiting overall Equifax EBITDA margins. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q 2022 to be $2.08 to $2.18 per share compared to the 1Q '21 adjusted EPS of $1.97 per share.\nNow let's turn to Slide 18. At our Investor Day in November, we discussed the strong earnings and cash flow that can be generated by 2025 by Equifax executing our new long-term financial framework. We also shared a scenario for you to consider that assuming the U.S. mortgage market normalizes by 2025 to the average levels we saw over 2015 to 2019 and we deliver revenue growth just above the midpoint of our 8% to 12% framework growth rate, revenue in 2025 could be about $7 billion. And continuing to execute our cloud data and tech transformation at these revenue levels could deliver 39% EBITDA margins by 2025.\nBeyond 2025, we expect to see revenue expansion of 8% to 12% and deliver margin expansion of, on average, 50 basis points per year, reflecting our significant operating leverage and high variable margins.\nAs shown on Slide 19, free cash flow accelerated significantly in 2021, reaching $866 million and 92% of adjusted net income. In 2022, excluding the $345 million payment on the U.S. consumer class action settlement made in January, free cash flow will exceed $1 billion and 95% of adjusted net income.\nAs we discussed in November at our Investor Day, to the extent we are able to deliver revenue growth and EBITDA margins I just referenced in 2025, we could generate $2.7 billion of EBITDA, $12.75 in adjusted EPS and $1.6 billion in free cash flow, almost double the $866 million that we delivered in 2021. The substantial increase in free cash flow creates significant capacity for M&A and also for a return of capital to shareholders through cash generation and increased debt capacity.\nNow I'd like to turn it back to Mark.\n\nMark W. Begor\n\nCEO & Director, Equifax Inc.",
    "content2": "Thanks, John. As highlighted on Slide 20, we remain laser-focused on our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage the new EFX Cloud with innovation new products. EFX2023 is the foundation of our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and the foundation of the new Equifax.\nWe continue to make significant progress executing the Equifax cloud data and technology transformation. We now have about half of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. This will build meaningfully in 2022 as we expect to substantially complete our North America cloud migrations. We've now completed almost 112,000 B2B migrations, over 10 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations.\nIn North America, our principal consumer exchanges are in production in the new Equifax cloud-based single data fabric and delivering to our customers. Our International transformation is also progressing and is expected to be principally complete by the end of 2023 with some customer migrations continuing into 2024.\nWe remain on track and confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics and technology company. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities, but remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth and cost savings in 2022 and beyond.\nAt our Investor Day in November, we discussed how the execution of our new EFX2023 strategic priorities, including the Equifax data and technology cloud transformation, will lead to stronger revenue growth, faster margin expansion and higher adjusted EPS growth.\nWe introduced the new Equifax long-term financial framework shown on Slide 21, with total revenue growth of 8% to 12%, including 100 to 200 basis points of growth from bolt-on M&A. We also expect to deliver margin expansion, as John mentioned a few minutes ago, with 50 basis points per year over the long term. That will help us deliver adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 16%, which combined with our 1% dividend yield target will allow us to deliver a total return to shareholders of 13% to 18% going forward.\nReinvesting our strong outperformance and strategic and accretive bolt-on M&A is a key priority for the future. As shown on the left side of Slide 22, 2021 was a strong year for bolt-on M&A with 8 acquisitions closed totaling about $3 billion that added $300 million to run rate revenue, excluding synergies.\nOur M&A priorities are clear and focused on expanding and strengthening the core of Equifax through, number one, expanding and strengthening our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions; number two, adding unique data assets; number three, expanding in the fast-growing $19 billion identity and fraud space; and number four, continuing to look to expand our credit bureau footprint globally. We expect to add 100, 200 basis points in revenue growth each year from bolt-on M&A.\nIn 2021, we completed 8 strategic and accretive acquisitions shown on Slide 23. We substantially strengthened and broadened Workforce Solutions through the acquisition of Appriss as well as Health e(fx), HIREtech and i2verify. And we strengthened our identity and fraud portfolio through the acquisition of Kount and our USIS differentiated data assets through both the Teletrack and Kount acquisitions.\nThese were critical acquisitions for Equifax that we're now focused on fully integrating the businesses and driving synergies to accelerate our growth. Reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy and long-term growth framework.\nWe're starting off '22 -- we're starting '22 off strong with a bolt-on acquisition that we closed earlier this week. As outlined on Slide 24, Efficient Hire further strengthens Workforce Solutions by bringing expanded employer services to hospitality, building services and senior living. The acquisition also strengthens Workforce Solutions to better compete and penetrate the hourly and high-volume hiring market and provides us with incremental TWN records.\nSlide 25 highlights the tremendous growth of Workforce Solutions, both in revenue and EBITDA margins over the past 5 years. The very strong growth of the work number and the addition of Appriss Insights and expansion of the EWS Data Hub have dramatically expanded the Workforce Solutions addressable markets across new verticals of talent solutions, government, Employer Services, including onboarding as well as their core mortgage and financial services markets.\nOur ability to access these markets with our unique and still expanding TWN employment, income and talent data and services will allow EWS to continue to deliver above-market core growth and power EFX in the future. We're also leveraging the new EWS cloud-based tech platform for international expansion with the announcement I mentioned earlier of our new U.K. income and employment verification services. This adds to our EWS solutions in Canada, Australia and India.\nWorkforce Solutions has grown from about 25% of Equifax revenue 3 years ago to over 40% last year and will likely grow to over 50% of Equifax in the coming years. The above-market growth in Workforce Solutions and depth and diversity of their people-based assets have moved Equifax well beyond the traditional credit bureau space and made us a faster growing and more diverse business than we were a short 3 years ago.\nAs shown on Slide 26, the new Equifax is a customer and product-centric company that will deliver 8% to 12% revenue growth in the future by leveraging our Equifax cloud-native architecture centered on a single data fabric to enable seamless use of our unique data assets to deliver new products faster and more effectively. Executing on our EFX2023 growth strategy and delivering revenue growth consistent with the midpoint of our long-term framework will allow us to deliver $7 billion of revenue and 39% EBITDA margins in 2025, as John just mentioned a few minutes ago and as we shared with you in November.\nWrapping up on Slide 27, Equifax delivered another strong base quarter with above-market growth in 2021, more than offsetting a declining mortgage market. We are operating exceptionally well and have strong momentum as we move into 2022.\nWe've now delivered 8 consecutive quarters of strong above-market double-digit growth, reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is on offense.\nWorkforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter and year, powering our results, delivering 29% revenue growth in the fourth quarter while integrating Appriss Insights and the 3 other 2021 bolt-on acquisitions that strengthened the core of our Workforce Solutions. Workforce is clearly our largest, fastest-growing and most valuable business. And Rudy and his team remain focused on driving outsized growth.\nUSIS also delivered a strong quarter with 12% nonmortgage growth and about 6% organic nonmortgage growth, offsetting the impact of a sharp over 20% decline in the mortgage market. Sid and the USIS team remain competitive and are working and are winning in the marketplace.\nInternational grew for the fifth consecutive quarter with 6% growth in local currency as economies reopen and business activity resumes. We have high expectations for International as we move into 2022.\nWe spent the last 3 years building the Equifax cloud and are in the early days of leveraging our new and uniquely Equifax cloud-based technology and single data fabric capabilities. As we move into '22 and beyond, we will increasingly realize the top line, cost and cash benefits from these new only Equifax cloud capabilities.\nAnd we've already added a strategic bolt-on acquisition to Workforce Solutions this week that combined with the acquisitions we made in 2021 are contributing 320 basis points or almost $160 million to 2022 revenue growth. We continue to build our pipeline as we look to add 100 to 120 basis points of revenue growth annually from bolt-on M&A.\nOur 2022 guidance with core revenue growth of 16% is well above our new 8% to 12% long-term framework. And 8% growth in total is aligned with our prior guidance despite a 21% decline in the mortgage market.\nOur ability to offset the additional 650 basis points of mortgage decline with stronger core growth reflects the breadth and strength of the new Equifax. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 13% to $8.65 at the midpoint, which also aligns with the '22 framework we reviewed with you in October.\nI'm energized about our strong above-market performance in 2021, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax in '22 and beyond. We remain convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future.\nI'd also like to announce today that Trevor Burns is returning to the Equifax Investor Relations team. Please join me in welcoming Trevor back to IR and feel free to contact Trevor, Dorian or Sam with any questions.\nAnd with that, operator, let me open it up for questions."

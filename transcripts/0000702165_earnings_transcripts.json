[Operator Instructions] And I would like to turn the conference over to Luke Nichols, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLuke Nichols\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.\nOur presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures, including adjusted or non-GAAP operating ratio. Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis.\nTurning to Slide 3. I'll now turn the call over to Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark George.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jason Zampi, our Chief Financial Officer. We delivered another quarter that demonstrates the team's ability to deliver a quality railroad.\nThroughout the year, we have highlighted our continued commitment to focus on what we can control, running a safe, efficient network, improving processes, delivering solutions for our customers' most pressing needs and supporting our people. That remains the approach today of our 20,000 thoroughbreds who deserve thanks and credit for our performance. On safety, our train accident and employee injury rates continue to improve. That's the result of disciplined execution and continued emphasis on training. Safety is a core value, and we will never compromise on it.\nOn service, our network is running well. Terminal dwell and car velocity remains stable, and we once again saw fuel efficiency gains, attaining a new quarterly record. These improvements are integral to delivering reliable, high-quality service for our customers and they position us to sustain performance over the long term. Safety and service together form the foundation of our ability to serve customers at the highest level. And what truly powers this progress is our people. Across the railroad, the Thoroughbred team shows up every day with focus and determination. We are committed to building the next generation of railroaders because careers in rail continue to be among the best in the country. As we noted at recent conferences, the third quarter volume surges forecasted by partners didn't materialize as expected and the truck market remains oversupplied. Ed will detail this.\nSo while revenues were short of where we expected, the continued success on productivity was evident in the quarter. We also had a large land sale at the end of the quarter that helped neutralize other adverse impacts that Jason will cover. While not big in Q3, we started to see some of the revenue erosion from competitor reactions to the merger announcement. We expect the impact to grow in the fourth quarter and continue to be a challenge over the near and medium term.\nAs we make progress toward getting approval for the proposed merger with Union Pacific, our focus remains squarely on ensuring momentum on safety and service. while executing on our strategy and delivering for our customers. We've got a lot to be optimistic about. We're on a good path, and we're doing what we can on the controllable side to prepare for growth. I'm proud of the progress we've made, and I'm even more excited about what's ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to John and the rest of our leadership team to walk through the quarter in more detail. John?\n\nJohn F. Orr\n\nEVP of Operations, Kansas City Southern\n\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. I want to recognize the deliberate transformation Norfolk Southern has delivered in safety, service and cost structure from 2024 and throughout 2025. This progress reflects a culture of accountability and disciplined execution, powered by generational leadership investments that position us for long-term success. We're creating a network that is safer, more reliable and more efficient, shaping the future of rail and setting the standard for what rail service can and should be.\nOur PSR 2.0 transformation is delivering measurable outcomes that matter to every customer and stakeholder. For example, Amtrack host delays across Norfolk Southern improved 26% year-over-year, underscoring our progress and unwavering commitment to precision, reliability and the standards that define Notebook Southern.\nIn Q4, we're going live with Clarity camps, the next cornerstone of the Thoroughbred Academy. The curriculum elevates PSR 2.0 business excellence. And importantly, as we transform safety and service standards were simultaneously delivering productivity gains, creating a clear and steady direction across the organization. All these efforts are aligned to our broader commitment to deliver meaningful expense controls while operating a reliable and more resilient railroad. Relative to 2024 full year results, our year-to-date safety figures demonstrate FRA personal injury ratio has improved 7.8% and our train accident ratio has improved 27.7%.\nOur team will never be satisfied with our safety results. We always strive to improve on our best performance. That's why my team and I are spending more time in the field this quarter, staying close to the work, staying close to our people and staying focused on what drives results.\nTurning to Slide 6. We achieved stronger service and volume growth this quarter while operating with fewer assets and resources. That discipline is clearly reflected in our financial outcomes. GTMs increased 4% year-over-year, which were accurately delivered with 6% fewer qualified T&E. Our revolving zero-based train service plan continues to drive cost control, precision and productivity. Key highlights include a 19% reduction in [indiscernible] a 12% decrease in intermodal trend starts since the beginning of the year, alongside of sequential improvement in intermodal service composite and a 5.5% merchandise carload growth.\nTurning to Slide 7. These results reflect decisive actions to balance quality service and efficiency. We're on track to exceed our expense reduction and broader financial commitments, and we're not stopping there. The team is stretching for more. raising our efficiency targets to a 2026 cumulative goal in the range of $600 million. Operational metrics confirm the effectiveness of our field management strategy. which delivered an all-time quarterly record of $1.01, a 5% year-over-year gain. This reflects both immediate savings and a durable path to greater efficiencies. Sequentially, train speed rose 3%, allowing us to store more locomotives while running a leaner, more reliable fleet.\nTurning to Slide 8. Rapid deployment of next level field technology is part of a broader strategy to transform inspection, reliability and overall performance. In the photos, you can see a new state-of-the-art wheel integrity system being installed near Burns Harbor, 1 of our busiest quarters. We're advancing machine vision at speed across our network. In the quarter, we deployed a new inspection portal in Virginia, bringing the total now to 8. We positively identified over 40 wheel integrity defects. And we've launched 6 new algorithms with 9 more already in development. The data from these field technologies feed our war room that are staffed with craft employees, managers and senior executives facilitating real-time problem-solving and cross-functional collaboration. We're leveraging digital tools, operational analytics and ecosystem level coordination to elevate our capabilities and operation and safety excellence.\nWayside stops are down 6.7% year-over-year and 36% year-to-date, even as we expect 5% more axles daily. This quarter reflects that our operational fundamentals are sound and are supporting a strong service offering. This is made possible by the commitment and resilience of our railroaders across the entire enterprise. At Norfolk Southern, results matter, and our people continue to deliver with confidence and momentum. With that, I'll turn it to you, Ed.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nVP of Industrial Products, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks much, John. Now let's go to Slide 10, where you'll see that we achieved 2% year-over-year growth in both revenue and RPU in the quarter. We see several dynamics at play in the business portfolio. We have strength within our merchandise markets, partially offset by meaningful declines in export coal markets. We see reduced fuel surcharge revenue and softer-than-expected intermodal volumes.\nOverall, our volume for the third quarter finished flat despite gross ton mile growth of 4%. Let's look inside of merchandise. Volume grew 6% from a year ago, driven by our auto, chemical and metals and construction markets. Revenue less fuel grew 7%, which underscores our pricing discipline and our volume performance. However, we had mixed headwinds from growth in commodities such as natural gas liquids, sand and scrap metal, which diluted our overall RPU performance. In Intermodal, we're navigating the complexity of ongoing trade and tariff uncertainty persistently abundant highway truck capacity and outside factors, including competitor responses to our merger announcement, which caused volumes to decrease 2%. Intermodal revenue less fuel and RPU less fuel both grew, reflecting the overall stable pricing environment right now.\nNow here, I have to note that year-over-year RPU comparisons benefited from an abnormally high volume of empty shipments ahead of the East Coast port disruptions last year. Let's turn to coal, where weakening seaborne coal prices drove RPU less fuel lower by 7% and and this was the most significant revenue headwind for the quarter. We enjoyed stronger demand in our Utility segment, but it didn't offset the sustained weakness in export. This interaction has been playing out throughout the year, and we expect it to persist.\nLet's go to Slide 11 and talk about the market outlook. Like the third quarter, we continue to navigate a dynamic economic environment, along with competitive cross currents. For our merchandise markets, we forecast vehicle production will be challenged in part due to recent disruptions at a key material supplier to our customers. We expect this will have a meaningful impact to production at several NS-served automotive plants in the fourth quarter. At the same time, overall manufacturing activity remains mixed with output expected to grow despite the backdrop of trade and tariff uncertainty. Strong fracking activity in the Marcellus Utica Basin is supporting demand and NGLs and sand in our merchandise markets. Looking into our intermodal markets, we expect softer import demand in the near term. This reflects the impact of tariff volatility and growing trade pressures.\nWarehousing capacity remains tight as inventory levels expanded at the beginning of the year ahead of tariffs and truck capacity remains oversupplied. Coal prices have remained pressured with significant uncertainty surrounding export trade. And at the same time, we're expecting utility demand to see continued support from growing electricity demand and lower existing coal stockpiles. Now these dynamics should be considered against the backdrop of our recently announced merger, which has intensified competitor activity across the industry. And as a result, we anticipate volume pressure, particularly in our Intermodal segment. and so we're maintaining a cautious outlook for the remainder of 2025.\nLastly, as always, we want to thank our customers for their continued partnership and business the entire NS team is aligned around delivering the service that our customers need every day, building trust as a vital partner in their supply chains. Now with that, I'll hand it over to Jason to review our financial results.\n\nJason A. Zampi\n\nTreasurer and Acting Executive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ed. I'll start with the reconciliation of our GAAP results to the adjusted numbers that I will speak to today on Slide 13. The Total costs attributable to the Eastern Ohio incident were $13 million, which included $16 million of recoveries under our property insurance policies. In addition, we recognized the $12 million restructuring charge in the quarter as we continue to rationalize our technology projects.\nFinally, we also recorded $15 million in merger-related costs, consisting primarily of legal and professional services as well as employee retention accruals. Adjusting for these items, the operating ratio for the quarter was $63.3. From a bottom line perspective, we earned $3.30 per share.\nMoving to Slide 14, you'll find the comparison of our adjusted results versus last year and last quarter both comparisons reflecting a 10 basis point improvement in the operating ratio and the sequential comparison basically even with the current quarter.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Revenue was up, as I just discussed, but we were expecting approximately $75 million more revenue as we had guided to within the second quarter materials continued macro headwinds, a surge that never materialized and competitor responses from the merger announcement that started to really ramp up at the end of the quarter, all were barriers to the attainment of that expectation.\nExpenses were up 2% on a 4% increase in GTMs, but there are a lot of puts and takes within OpEx, and those year-over-year expense drivers are laid out on Slide 15. You'll note that the quarter benefited from higher land sales, which were $65 million more than last year. In fact, the entire variance was driven by 1 large sale that closed at the very end of the quarter.\nAnother quarter of strong productivity gains also helped to mitigate both inflationary and volumetric pressures in addition to the absence of benefits recorded last year in the form of cancellation of stock awards and fuel recoveries. I'd also point out that claims expense was elevated in the quarter despite the outstanding progress we're delivering on our safety initiatives as we react to unfavorable developments on claims from several years ago, in addition to claims inflation on a few incidents that we have experienced this year.\nSo as I think about our 63.3 operating ratio for the quarter, Clearly, that was aided by outsized land sales. However, we were short on revenue from our latest guidance, and we dealt with higher claims expense than what we had been experiencing. And as we move into the fourth quarter, Revenue will continue to be challenged, but we are focused on what we can control, and we expect to maintain our cost structure in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range. I'll hand it back to Mark to wrap it up.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Jason. As you can see, there were a lot of moving parts in the quarter, but as a thoroughbred team, we are successfully controlling the controllables. Looking ahead, macro environment remains uncertain and we acknowledge that over the next several quarters, unpredictable demand and unique competitive dynamics will create some abnormal fluctuations in our top line. We are not standing still. Our recent Louisville announcement will create attractive volume growth as it builds out. Additionally, once the merger closes, we can provide attractive solutions for our customers unlocking faster, more reliable service, streamlined shipping experiences and expanded access across a unified coast-to-coast rail network.\nThese improvements will strengthen our value proposition and help drive long-term growth in our combined railroad through highway conversion. While the regulatory review process is ongoing, we remain laser-focused on maintaining strong safety performance, while running a fast and resilient network. That is delivering great service that our customers have now come to expect from us. Meanwhile, we will continue to maintain a sharp focus on optimizing our cost structure. As you saw in John's section, we are making excellent progress on the productivity front and are raising our 2025 efficiency target to roughly $200 million, and this follows the nearly $300 million we achieved in 2024. I am really proud of our team for the work they've done on this. And while revenue in this environment is proving difficult to guide, you can expect that our fourth quarter costs in absolute dollars will be in the $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion range.\nSo with that, let's open the call to questions.\nOperator? .\n\nOperator\n\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call.

So let me ask Jim to start the call by laying out our vision.\n\nThank you, Mark. On behalf of the Union Pacific Board and leadership team, I am honored to be with you today to discuss our agreement to combine Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern in a combination valued at over $250 billion. This is a historic, transformative moment for our companies, our customers, and our great nation. Together, we will create America's first transcontinental railroad. With this transaction, we will generate significant value for our stakeholders and for all Americans. It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago and will usher in a new era of American innovation.\n\nUnion Pacific and Norfolk Southern are two of the strongest operating railroads in the U.S. with a combined 360 years of franchise history. Generations of railroaders at both of our companies have helped build America into what it is today, and today's railroaders will demonstrate that there is no better combined team to deliver America's first transcontinental railroad.\n\nI ask you to turn to slide four. It lays out how this new, seamless, single-line service supports U.S. growth. Railroads are the backbone of the U.S. economy. We power industries, connect communities, and deliver the materials that build homes, grocery stores, factories, and cities. You name it, and the railroad likely moved it. Moving freight safely, efficiently, and affordably keeps American manufacturing competitive and neighborhoods growing. To that end, the United States has the best freight transportation system in the world, and this transaction will make it even stronger. The transcontinental railroad is the right next step toward achieving that goal.\n\nCombining Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern to unite the nation from east to west transforms the U.S. supply chain and transportation landscape. Our single-line service will create new routes and increase access across this nation, making freight rail transportation a cost-effective option for more American shippers. By eliminating interchanges, customers' products will reach their destination faster. Increased speed and reliability combined with lower freight costs per mile makes rail a more attractive option than truck. And with improved service reliability, we will lower our customers' inventory and equipment costs with reduced cycle time.\n\nThe impacts of this transaction for American communities can't be overstated. Our merger will reduce highway congestion and road maintenance burdens on American taxpayers. One intermodal train removes more than 550 trucks from the highway and is 75% more fuel efficient than trucks. We pay to maintain our networks with focused infrastructure investment to support long-term growth and the safety of our operations. Together, this will enhance supply chain reliability, support the industrial renaissance, and make U.S. manufacturing more competitive and accessible.\n\nReal investments have a broad impact on economic development and job creation. Importantly, Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern are aligned. All of our union employees who have a job today will have jobs tomorrow. in our merged company. And a company that is growing its business and spurring economic development creates even more jobs. The ultimate impact of investment in our combined company infrastructure, talent, and technology will be immense for American communities and businesses nationwide. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern are committed to finding new ways to drive growth, benefit customers, and enhance rail safety and competitors.\n\nI could go on and on, but I'll pause and ask Mark for his perspective on this historic transaction. Mark? Thanks, Jim. It is a historic day, not just for our companies, but for our industry, our country, and all of our stakeholders. This combination brings together two teams with a shared commitment to advancing our nation's economy, connecting people, strengthening our communities, and building a stronger, more competitive America. Both Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific have been an integral part of our country's growth for generations. With this transaction, we will extend Norfolk Southern's rich, nearly 200-year history alongside Union Pacific, unlocking new opportunities for our customers in our next chapter.\n\nWe've strengthened our operations and have been disciplined in the execution of our strategy, running an efficient network, improving processes, and driving excellence. We're championing safety and continuous improvement at every level and have fostered the discipline to continue delivering a service product that's not only competitive, it's compelling for our customers. And with the leaders we have, and processes we're instilling, we are now demonstrating network resilience in the face of challenges. In these efforts, they have led us to today, a turning point for the industry that's only possible because of the Thoroughbreds team commitment, strength, and belief in our mission.\n\nI'm so proud of everything we've accomplished, and I want to commend our dedicated leadership team and our whole organization, for they've all done wonderful things to deliver results. By joining together with Union Pacific, this transaction will allow us to build on the momentum that we've created.\n\nand to really create America's true first transcontinental railroad, delivering more for our customers, our shareholders, our people, and the communities we call home. The ability to deliver for all our stakeholders simultaneously was central to my initial conversations with Jim. We share a vision for the rail industry, where traffic grows, customers have faster, more reliable shipping, our nation's economy expands with less emissions, and importantly, our people continue to be central to our business. Not only is this an opportunity to strengthen the supply chain. but one where we can deliver something no one else can, a freight railroad that unites our nation.\n\nJoining our over 19,000-mile network and powerful franchise with those of Union Pacific will allow us to deliver a more effective and competitive railroad, creating compelling benefits for this iconic American industry and our workers. We will create opportunities for our employees as we grow by delivering reliable and timely service for our customers. We will build value for shareholders who will benefit from both the opportunity to participate in significant upside as holders of the combined organization. which we believe will be a must-own large-cap stock and should trade at a robust multiplier. We will unlock potential for the American economy today and well into the future.\n\nAnd we look forward to all that we will accomplish together.\n\nJim. Thank you, Mark. Combining our two great companies creates an impressive rail network as laid out on slide five. The Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern Combined Network, supported by over 52,000 railroaders, will span 50,000 plus miles across 43 states, reaching nearly every corner of the United States. It connects major manufacturing centers, agricultural region, and population center. It also unlocks rail options for shippers and markets where today's rail network is currently inefficient, such as gateway operations and connecting short-distance markets on both sides of the Mississippi River. Our combined network will connect 10 gateways with Mexico and Canada, as well as over 100 ports, opening strong international trade routes and supporting local and cross-border economic growth.\n\nImportantly, single line service reduces interchange points and creates increased fluidity and optionality. It reduces strain at our gateways and interchange points, optimizes handoffs, and eliminates rubber tire interchanges. Today, around one million carloads interchange between our two companies. In the future, those million carloads will immediately see a 24- to 48-hour improvement in their transit time. That combination of faster service and greater market reach is powerful, making our transcontinental railroad an attractive choice for both current and future customers. Our network will be strengthened by continued capital investment. In 2025, that combined investment will total around $5.6 billion.\n\nThese investments are critical to support safety, service, and operational efficiency improvements, and we're committed to continue those investments to support U.S. economic growth going forward.\n\nNow turning to slide six. Ultimately, we believe this new combined network enhances competition and increases growth opportunities that are in the public interest, benefiting all stakeholders. For us, this isn't just about winning versus the other rails, which we will, but it's also competing against other modes of transportation, whether that's barge, truck, or pipeline to name a few. It's providing a transportation product that competes for broader industrial development and supports reshoring manufacturing growth in the U.S. Our unified transcontinental offering will allow us to compete more effectively with Canadian transcontinental rails, making U.S. ports more competitive and winning back U.S.\n\nfreight volume in American jobs. With route optionality that creates direct routes east and west, we'll help our customers win in their marketplace. Single line service opens up more customer options to and from underserved areas in the Ohio Valley and the Mississippi River watershed. By connecting around 100 ports and 10 international gateways, we enable more efficient and cost effective supply chains. Stepping back, the combined network will capitalize on the strength of Union Pacific's West Coast Ports and Norfolk Southern's East Coast Ports. Merging the strength of both companies' intermodal networks facilitates the capture of international trade volumes and domestic truck conversions.\n\nThe beauty of U.S. ports is the population centers around the ports, as well as the inland reach, thus making our ports a more natural destination when paired with excellent service and a wide portfolio of destinations.\n\nSlide seven. Summarizes a lot of what you've heard so far and why we see this combination as a win for our customers. A couple things I'd add. First is a question of enhancing competition. One way we're considering addressing this is through a proven framework we've employed in the past. It's a framework used by Union Pacific for select traffic in the Pacific Northwest. The results have demonstrated that it has enhanced competition while supporting carload growth that has outpaced the market. While more details will come through the STB application process, we believe it will be a win for our customers.\n\nA significant note, with this combination, fewer than 20 customers will go from having two rail providers to just one, and we intend to provide a competitive alternative. Second, the deployment of state-of-the-art technology like Union Pacific's NetControl and CADET systems, along with Norfolk Southern's advanced algorithms that drive digital train inspection, will create a safer, more efficient overall network, while enhancing customer experience through shipment visibility and tracking. Now imagine steel moving from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Colton, California, seamlessly. And then copper moving from Arizona to the east with fewer touch points. Increased speed and better customer tracking capability.\n\nThe possibilities are endless and only increases my excitement about what's possible.\n\nI'll now hand it over to Jason to transition the conversation to the financial aspects of the deal. Jason? Thanks, Jim. This proposed combination creates both scale and balance, as laid out on slide 8. Based on 2024 pro forma results, our combined company has revenue of $36.4 billion, EBITDA roughly $18 billion, and an operating ratio of 62.1%. This scale, combined with operational discipline, positions us to capture greater value as rail demand continues to grow. And specifically, with the combined operating ratio, there's clearly room for continued improvement. Together, UPNNS handle more than 14 million carloads a year across numerous business lines within our industrial, bulk, intermodal, and automotive segments.\n\nYou've heard both companies talk separately about how this diversity helps us navigate the ups and downs of economic cycles. This merger only increases our combined company's ability to weather any storm.\n\nImportantly, this isn't just about being a bigger railroad, it's about being a better railroad, one that is more efficient and creates more value for our customers.\n\nNow, I'll turn it over to Jennifer to walk through the financial opportunity our proposed combination creates. Jennifer? Thank you, Jason, and good morning.\n\nSlide 9 provides a one-stop shop for the transaction details. Jim has already touched on a few of these points, but let me highlight that under the proposed terms, Norfolk Southern shareholders will receive one share of Union Pacific stock and $88.82 cash for each Norfolk Southern common share. This represents an $85 billion headline value based on Union Pacific's July 16th unaffected closing price and a 25% premium to Norfolk Southern's 30 trading day volume-weighted average price. In terms of the roughly $20 billion cash portion required for the transaction, I should point out that there will be no voting trust, so no funding will occur until the transaction closes.\n\nAt close, we will fund that through a combination of cash that we generate between now and closing, as well as issuance of debt. As part of that, both Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have suspended share repurchases, but will maintain their respective dividends.\n\nFor that premium, we are creating a transcontinental railroad that unlocks $2.75 billion in synergies, as illustrated on slide 10. We see a clear path to achieving these annualized synergies in the third year post-close, represented by both revenue growth and productivity. On the revenue side, synergies of $1.75 billion will be heavily driven by modal conversion, as single-line service makes rail more competitive versus truck. As Jim laid out, lanes such as the Pacific Northwest to the Watershed and Southern California to the Ohio Valley provide great opportunities to win new business. Beyond Intermodal, we see opportunities such as finished vehicles moving nationwide, food and beverage shipments traveling west to east, industrial chemicals moving from the Gulf to eastern markets, and tires and steel rod moving east to west.\n\nAs you saw on slide 8, both companies bring a diverse business mix to this transaction, which gives us a wide aperture to pursue growth opportunities. Cost synergies of $1 billion will result from improved safety and efficiency through shared best practices, reduction of material costs, enhanced asset utilization, routing efficiencies, and rationalization of back office costs. For example, through just the optionality of single line service, we'll increase locomotive productivity and generate fuel savings through less idle time at gateways. We'll gain workforce productivity through fewer car touches, as well as driving the culture of operational excellence across an expanded footprint.\n\nTo support these cost synergies, we expect to spend roughly $2 billion in incremental capital to integrate the network.\n\nFinally, the deployment of state-of-the-art technology from both rails will create a safer, more efficient overall network. Looking then to slide 11, this transaction yields very compelling financial profile for the combined company, as the $2.75 billion in synergies achieved by year 3 represents more than $30 billion of value creation. We expect adjusted EPS to be accretive early in the second year post-close, with high single-digit accretion thereafter as the synergies are realized. Annual free cash flow will grow from a 2024 pro forma combined $7 billion to an estimated $12 billion by 2029 with synergies reflecting 10% annual growth.\n\nWith this strong cash generation, we will rapidly deliver our balance sheet. In fact, we expect to close the transaction with a debt to EBITDA of around 3.3 times and be back to around 2.8 times by 2028, less than two years post-close. With our commitment to prioritizing the balance sheet and discussions with the rating agencies, we would expect to maintain our current A-rated status. The more than 60% increase in run-rate-free cash flow supports our balanced capital allocation policy, reinvesting in our combined network, rewarding our shareholders with a competitive dividend, and resuming share repurchases in 2028. By year three, we expect to be repurchasing more than $10 billion in shares annually.\n\nBottom line, we are very pleased with what this deal represents for both Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern shareholders. We see it as a win today and a win for the future.\n\nI'll now turn it back to Jim to discuss the next steps and wrap up. Thank you, Jennifer. Obviously, this is a first major step in this process.\n\nI'm on slide 12. In terms of the timing and path to completion, the transaction is subject to review and approval by the Surface Transportation Board with its statutory time. We are Union Pacific, do not. takes steps lightly. We think them through. We make sure we have a strong case. We make sure that the team is ready to move ahead. And we're very comfortable with where we are as we move ahead. As I mentioned earlier, our robust plans not only preserve but also enhance competition and will be filed with the Servers Transportation Board in due course.\n\nFor all the reasons you've heard today, we're confident that the transaction serves the public interest and meets relevant requirements. The transaction is also subject to approval by both Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern shareholders.\n\nI want to be very clear here. We are both deeply committed to making this a seamless and integration process as possible. We understand that we need to avoid distracting our organizations during this approval process in a way that impacts our customers. And once the transaction is complete, we need to move as quickly as possible to deliver the benefits our stakeholders expect.\n\nNow turning to slide 13, a transaction of this size and scope won't be easy to execute. We understand that. Key is having the right strategy and the right team to execute it. At Union Pacific, our safety, service, and operational excellence strategy has propelled our company to industry best. We've made significant safety improvements, taken service to all-time best levels, and the operational efficiency and financial performance speaks for itself, as we reported just a short time ago. A big part of our strategy's success has been maintaining a buffer of resources to handle the fluctuations of railroading. As we implement this transcontinental railroad, that buffer strategy will remain imperative.\n\nAt Norfolk Southern, their thoroughbred culture has driven significant improvements over the past year plus. They have great momentum across those same key elements of safety, service, and efficiency. It demonstrates that our companies are aligned on the fundamentals of running a great railroad. With the collective talent of both organizations combined with a winning strategy, I'm confident that we'll deliver for our stakeholders.\n\nMark, appreciate your thoughts on the cultural alignment before we wrap it up. Sure, Jim. You know, however you label the strategy, it comes down to the core fundamentals. And from the start of the transaction, it was evident that the DNA of our companies were very similar. You know, we have our core NS spirit values, which represent safety, performance, integrity, respect, innovation, and teamwork. And those are very closely aligned with Union Pacific. And we expect to combine the best of both companies' programs and technology to set a new bar for rail safety and performance, advancing our shared commitment to keeping rail the safest way to move freight over land.\n\nAnd I just want to reiterate a point that Jim made earlier. Both companies are committed to a seamless integration. We understand that we need to continue to provide our customers with a high level of service throughout this process, avoiding distraction and disruption. We'll have plenty of time to do thorough integration planning while the transaction is under review and post-closing. And we commit, we're going to put the appropriate resources and time in place to assure that we do this the right way. Both companies have an immense amount of pride in their histories and how they've shaped our great nation.\n\nAnd if we use that as a foundation while focusing on what we can control, I'm confident that these groups of railroaders will come together to win for our customers, our communities, our nation, and each other.\n\nJim? Thanks, Mark. Now, wrapping up on slide 14, it summarizes the unprecedented benefits of this merger. This is a historic milestone for the entire rail industry and for America. This transaction will unite the nation, connecting businesses, consumers, and communities. It will accelerate growth, enhance competition, spur economic development and employment, and unleash economic innovation. Built on our safety service and operational excellence strategy, we will accelerate improvements in the safety, service, and efficiency of our combined network. And through significant synergies and free cash flow generation, we will deliver enhanced shareholder value. Our great companies have deep roots in spurring the industrial revolution of the past.\n\nWith this combination, we take the next step in driving the economic growth and prosperity of the future.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks.\n\nWe will not open the lines to answer your questions. Thank you.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you do have any questions at this time, please press star followed by 1 on your touchtone phone. You will then hear a prompt that your hand has been raised. Should you wish to decline from the polling process, please press star followed by 2. And if you're using your speakerphone, you will need to lift the handset first before pressing any keys.

Now turning to Slide 3. It's my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark George.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining. Representing Norfolk Southern with me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jason Zampi, our Chief Financial Officer. We're looking forward to updating you on our Q1 2025 results.\nThere's a lot to be pleased with this quarter as we delivered results in line with what we signaled to you, while dealing with a vicious winter, including 18 storms that were far more consequential to our network than Helene was last fall. John will share details on that impact and how we quickly restore fluidity to our network in order to serve our customers with minimal disruption. Our network resiliency was evident again, thanks to great planning and execution by our team, and we did it safely, with lower injury and accident rates, as our team continues to embrace safety as a core value. Despite all this disruption and absorbing $35 million of storm restoration costs that Jason will detail, we delivered 8% EPS growth on an adjusted basis, driven in part by $55 million of labor productivity savings. I'd like to thank every member of the thoroughbred team for their hard work and dedication during quarter.\nTeamwork and a focus on safety and service excellence are what's propelling our progress. We're also proud of our commercial agility staying close to our customers as we, and they, dealt with weather-related impacts to operations, East Coast port rebalancing and volume fluctuations in anticipation of tariffs. Our behaviors and performance are increasing our customers' confidence in our service product, and that's driving meaningful share gains. We're doing a better job anticipating market and customer needs, taking on the right long-term growth opportunities in the most strategic lanes. We are dressed and ready to handle volume growth. Overall, Norfolk Southern is doing what we set out to do. We remain focused on what we can control, that safety, network performance, customer service and costs. I'll hand it off to the team now to provide more color on the results, starting with John.\n\nJohn F. Orr\n\nEVP of Operations, Kansas City Southern\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning. Starting on Slide 5. As you said, the weather tested the resolve of the operating team in what was both a challenging and rewarding quarter. We faced significant weather across most of our network. Mark mentioned 18 storms. Let me tell you about one of them. Depicted in Slide 5 is our Heartland Corridor. A flash flood caused the Tug River to rise almost instantaneously to its highest flood levels since 1977. This impacted a 100-mile stretch of our mainline that moves over 50 trains a day. Depicted on the top left is a fill failure. The restoration of this one location required 8,700 tons of rock, the equivalent of about 700 truckloads of material. The repair to this remote yet critical location was accomplished in just 52 hours.\nMeanwhile, 87 miles down the same river system, the floodwaters and debris surged against this overpass. That's the image you see depicted in the lower left. Debris and high water jeopardize the bridge's structural integrity. We fought for 2 days against the surging water before being able to remove the debris and restore the bridge deck. There were 35 additional outages caused by the Tug River flood that were simultaneously repaired over a 4-day period. During the quarter, we incurred $35 million in extraordinary expense to respond to storms, which adversely affected our operating ratio. While we can't control the weather, we can control our preparation and our response, and I am extremely proud of the entire team.\nTurning to Slide 6. Our FRA injury ratio was down 13% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. This is the lowest quarterly ratio in over a decade. Train accident frequency reduced by 43% year-over-year. Our pursuit of safety excellence and speak of culture is showing tangible results. Turning to Slide 7.\nWe delivered year-over-year network and productivity improvements across the board. Terminal Dwell, AAR Train Speed, Car Velocity and Locomotive Productivity improved meaningfully year-over-year. Turning to our Service metrics. While we improved merchandise trip plan compliance, our time-sensitive intermodal composite was the most impacted by the storms. Exiting February, intermodal service stabilized and in recent weeks, we are at target. These numbers alone don't tell the whole story of our performance. The first half of the quarter was the story of the operations center and the engineering department planning and executing responses to the many disruptions. The second half was the story of commercial, mechanical and transportation teamwork.\nFor example, commercial and operations created an inspirational March Madness initiative to catch up Lamberts Point's quarterly export coal volume. They collaborated with our supply chain and terminal partners to optimize coal sequencing and dumping at the peer. Together, we've delivered both our forecasted and backlog volume efficiently. Safety and service excellence are evident in these results.\nTurning to Slide 8. The team is proving the art of the possible. Our PSR 2.0 transformation is unlocking network value and delivering on our financial commitments. Our Zero-Based operating plan rolled out in the quarter. Phase 1 simplified train plans, tightened connection standards and strengthened our competitive resource and cost structures. For example, we netted a reduction of over 100 weekly crew starts. This generated yields in Train and T&E productivity, reduced final mile dwell for over 600 customers and reduced overall transit. Meanwhile, Enterprise Resources streamlined our materials management and distribution network. They are reducing material handlings, controlling expenses and all the while increasing productivity. They are relentlessly pursuing every opportunity to eliminate waste and drive efficiencies across all spend categories. This includes further improving energy management solutions and implementing advanced fuel initiatives.\nFor example, our HPT improved by 13% year-over-year. This resulted in a fuel efficiency record for the fourth consecutive quarter. We are aligning more closely to our suppliers while optimizing internal and transactional processes, positioning NS to fully leverage our scale and drive greater value for the long term. Our PSR 2.0 transformation simultaneously delivered safety, service and resilience. We powered through the adversity in the quarter, and we are carrying that great momentum into Q2. Over to you, Ed.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nVP of Industrial Products, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nWell, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Now let's move to Slide 10, and you'll see that the overall volume for the first quarter rose 1% year-over-year despite the winter weather conditions that we and our customers experienced during that period. And while total revenue was flat, continued fuel surcharge headwinds masked an otherwise solid revenue performance as total revenue, less fuel was up 2% and RPU less fuel was up 1% year-over-year despite sharply lower export coal pricing.\nSpecifically, within merchandise, volume fell from a year ago as gains in our Chemicals and Ag businesses were offset by weakness in our Metals and our Construction segment. The period saw a 4% increase in Merchandise RPU less fuel delivering another consecutive quarterly record in that metric. In Intermodal, we achieved a 3% year-over-year volume increase with gains in both domestic and international, while premium continues to face market pressure. Overall, Intermodal RPU less fuel was up slightly for the second consecutive quarter due to stabilization in truck pricing.\nNow let's turn to coal, where lower export coal prices drove RPU less fuel lower by 3%. Partially offsetting these shortfalls were volume gains in our utility business, thanks to strong electricity demand and support from higher natural gas prices. Okay. Let's move to Slide 11 for our market outlook.\nIt's clear that we're in a dynamic economic environment. For our merchandise markets, we expect strength in autos to continue in the near term, although announced tariffs could be a headwind to volumes for the remainder of the year. Manufacturing activity has been building in many markets, and we will stay close to our customers as trade policies unfold. Strength in our chemicals markets such as waste and plastics along with our intense focus on recapturing market share, give us confidence that we are well positioned to mitigate some of the uncertain market conditions that we see. Staying very close to our customers is the key here. When we look at our intermodal markets, we expect continued normalization of our East Coast share and are watching shipping patterns very carefully as trade policy evolves.\nIf tariffs drive prices for international goods higher, import demand may soften and we're staying close to that. Truck capacity remained steady throughout the quarter, which maintained a flat trend for our price outlook. Coal prices continue to be pressured as the industry is expected to see tempered production amid significant uncertainty around export trade. In the near term, we expect the current trends in the utility markets to continue.\nOn Slide 12. Industrial development activity continues to increase with strong interest from firms seeking to expand domestic production as well as international companies seeking to locate new manufacturing facilities in the United States. Sectors such as steel manufacturing, metals, fabrication, food production, and construction materials saw an increase in project activity through the latter half of the first quarter with momentum continuing to build through April. However, we're also noting cases where decision time lines appear to be extending as customers evaluate the macroeconomic environment. Considering all the uncertainty, I'm encouraged by our ability to maintain our quality service as volumes increased as we closed out the quarter, and I'm encouraged by our trajectory moving forward. As our customers navigate this uncertainty, we are by their side offering a service product that can help reduce their costs in their supply chains.\nWe sincerely appreciate the partnership that we've built with our customers and are striving to grow trust and to earn more of their business every single day. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jason to review our financial results.\n\nJason A. Zampi\n\nTreasurer and Acting Executive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ed. Slide 14 reconciles our GAAP results to the adjusted numbers that I will speak to you today. Insurance recoveries continued to exceed the incremental cost of the Eastern Ohio incident which resulted in a net benefit of $185 million in the quarter. Total insurance recoveries to date are nearing $1 billion with less than $100 million of coverage remaining. Adjusting for the net recovery related to the incident, operating ratio for the quarter was 67.9%, which includes 120 basis points from storm restoration costs. From a bottom line perspective, EPS was $2.69.\nMoving to Slide 15, you'll find the comparison of our adjusted results versus last year and last quarter. As we previewed during the quarter, the impacts of typical seasonality, coupled with the higher-than-expected winter storm restoration costs drove a sequential increase in the operating ratio of 300 basis points. From a year-over-year perspective, despite the elevated storm costs and flat revenues, our productivity initiatives have continued to take hold, and we generated 200 basis points of operating ratio improvement, with operating expenses down 3% on higher volumes. Let's take a closer look at the $68 million year-over-year expense decline on Slide 16.\nThe $35 million of incremental storm restoration costs are embedded in multiple line items, including [ compensation ], purchased services and materials. We are focused on what we can control, and our operational momentum and execution on productivity initiatives delivered cost savings across the board. Labor productivity was strong in the quarter. That, coupled with timing of land sales helped offset an incentive comp adjustment related to 2024, increased pay rates and higher claims costs. We continue to gain traction on our fuel efficiency, and importantly, our purchase services and rents were down $30 million in the face of 3% higher intermodal volumes. All of these actions support our cost takeout goals.\nSummarizing our adjusted financial results on Slide 17. The strong operational momentum that has been the foundation for continued productivity savings led to 8% improvements in both net income and EPS over last year. These results, together with ongoing balance sheet repair, led to the resumption of share repurchases, and we bought back nearly $250 million of shares in the quarter. The 200 basis point improvement in the operating ratio and this team's ability to deliver productivity savings in any environment gives us a lot of confidence as we move through these uncertain times. I'll turn it over to Mark to wrap up.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nAll right. As you have heard, we successfully navigated the first quarter to recover from the significant weather impacts to our network. At the same time, we delivered better service on higher volume all while continuing to drive greater productivity. Now as it relates to our guidance on Slide 19, one thing that we can control is our costs and we remain highly confident in our ability to extract at least $150 million, as evidenced by our strong momentum that continued in Q1. At this time, there's no clear information on how tariffs may impact our end markets and revenues. So we are reiterating our full year 3% revenue growth guide and 150 basis points of OR improvement, while acknowledging that there is uncertainty on the horizon.\nSo to drill a little deeper on that point, we will be keeping a close eye on the end markets, staying in close communication with our customers. There may be cases where we see changes in freight, origin and destination as well as changes between customers, some who may be on our network or on others. We may benefit in some instances or suffer in other cases, but our growing track record of service excellence and agility positions us to continue to capitalize on all opportunities. So as the effects become clearer in the months and quarters ahead, we will calibrate and communicate with you accordingly. But right now, our guidance remains intact. So with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Wednesday, January 29, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Luke Nichols, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLuke Nichols\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results.\nPlease refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures, including adjusted or non-GAAP operating ratio. Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark George.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. I'm joined here by John ore, our Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Jason Zampe, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our strong Q3 performance, we are very pleased to close out 2024 with another quarter of solid results, which further narrowed the margin gap to peers.\nOur strong operations enabled us to move 3% more volume in the quarter, yielding a 2% increase in revenue ex fuel. We continue to deliver on our commitments while building momentum to position Norfolk Southern for sustainable growth. Our network is running fast. Our terminals are efficient. Service metrics are as strong as they have ever been.\nOur customers are noticing and rewarding us with more business, and we continue to exercise strong cost discipline. When you put it all together, we delivered a Q4 that was in line with the guidance we gave wrapping up a year where we delivered or exceeded on all the commitments we made. We removed nearly $300 million of costs, $15 million more than the $250 million we committed to in the spring. Our adjusted operating ratio ended at 65.8, surpassing the guide we laid out of improvement between 100:150. And our second half OR was 64.1 at the favorable end of the range we outlined. The organization worked hard to deliver these results. I am proud and grateful to all the employees in Norfolk Southern. It's not just the financial results that are worth celebrating, our safety metrics improved dramatically throughout the year.\nOur employees are embracing safety as a guiding value, protecting one another as well as the communities we serve. Our employees are driving positive change and propelling the company forward. As you evaluate the operating and productivity improvements, remember, that we did this while taking on 5% more volume in 2024. I'm excited for John, Ed and Jason to share our results with you. Let's start with John.\n\nJohn F. Orr\n\nEVP of Operations, Kansas City Southern\n\nGood morning. Thanks, Mark. I'm excited to update you all on our safety and operating performance. Turning to Slide 6. Safety is the value through which all operating decisions are made. Our entire team is committed and engaged in our pursuit of safety excellence.\nThe improvements to date are a testament to the rigor of our safety protocols and a strong indication of the positive outcomes we can achieve in 2025. Our FRA reportable injury ratio increased from 1.1:1.15. And I'm encouraged that our Q4 results improved by 13% compared to the same period last year. In fact, in December, our FRA ratio was 0.61 and was the lowest reportable injury ratio since December 2020.\nOur FRA train accident rate for the full year improved by 27%. And in both cases, we are carrying positive momentum into Q1 and building on these strong results. For example, we finished 2024 and started 2025 injury-free for over 1 million man hours across all operations. At Norfolk Southern, people are at the heart of our strategy.\nOur Thoroughbred Academy is educating thousands of leaders, its curriculum offers an integrated approach that combines technical training with skill building and operational readiness, business planning and management engagement. We are proactively driving safety performance and enterprise excellence. We are building generational railroaders.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our PSR 2.0 approach is delivering simultaneous efficiency and service improvements. In 2024, our network performance progressively gained traction, anchored by dwell and velocity. We are growing less in yards, moving faster between terminals and rightsizing the fleet. This is generating fluidity and capacity, aligning our active fleets to volume, decreasing fleet maintenance expenses and reducing capital.\nYear-over-year, our system speed improved by 10%, taking it down a level. In the quarter, intermodal train speed gained 3.1%, and the true success stories were the remarkable gains in merchandise and unit train speeds, up 11% and 17%, respectively. As we drove up velocity, we took out assets, grew the business and we did more with less, ultimately, growing volumes by 5%.\nFor example, year-over-year car miles per car day rose over 13%. We are seeing similar benefits in our locomotive fleet. Velocity allowed us to store more locomotives, decrease our material expenses, increase our fleet reliability and drove overall fleet productivity. Year-over-year GTMs per available horsepower improved by 19%. And we also delivered record dual efficiencies, both for the quarter and the full year.\nAs we drive operating efficiencies, we are also delivering a quality product for our customers. After all, we're a company committed to outstanding service. We finished the year very strong, culminating with a successful intermodal perfect peak season, year-over-year, handling 7% more parcel volume per day with 0 controllable failures.\nTurning to Slide 8. Speeds matter. In 2024, we committed to tackle network underperformance and to close our margin gap. As Mark said, through our total team effort, we exceeded. For example, our car maintenance will room meticulously drilled down to root cause, fine-tuned our repair processes and provided near real-time feedback for the field.\nAs a result, year-over-year running repair and repaired well were down 31% and 23%, respectively. Improvements are also coming from our need for speed war room, whose mandate includes design speed into the network, overcome historic speed barriers and drive out infrastructure bottlenecks. The need for speed war room has contributed to our year-over-year 10% AAR speed increase.\nThey are now turning their attention to challenging every permanent and temporary slow order to actively reduce stops and drive additional fuel efficiencies. Over-the-road interruptions decreased by 25%, delivering significant gains in crew productivity and crew availability. For example, year-over-year, crew overtime and terminal detention costs were both down 19%.\nWhen I say this is a team effort, I'm talking about every NS reorder. We are working cross-functionally, cross structurally and broadly across the entire enterprise ecosystem to eliminate waste, increase revenues and drive efficiencies. These disciplines have allowed us to restructure our capital requirements, being up funds for key projects without compromise. We are entering 2025 with tremendous momentum. And we are unlocking productivity value for our network.\nThe next phase transformation of our operating plan is in development. The new plan will roll out in Q1. It will further reduce handlings, introduce tighter standards for terminal times and connections and will require us to continue stretching for improvement in our operating processes. In 2025, we will focus on fuel and mechanical infrastructure. These are big rocks for efficiencies and savings. I'm incredibly proud of the results the operating team has achieved in 2024. They rose to every challenge, showing NS grit, tenacity and drive. Coupled with PSR 2.0, their capabilities are driving net value creation in closing the service and productivity gap with our peers. I will now turn it over to Ed.\n\nEd Boyle\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I apologize upfront for my cold and ask that you bear with me here. Let's start on Slide 10. Overall volume for the fourth quarter improved 3% year-over-year. That was led by our intermodal and agriculture groups. Our total revenue and RPU declined primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue, along with negative mix within the portfolio and rate pressure within intermodal and coal that we've noted for most of the year.\nMerchandise volume improved slightly from higher soybean and corn shipments driven by new business and some spot opportunities, but these gains were offset by declines in automotive, metals and energy-related markets. The quarter saw a 2% increase in RPU less fuel , which marks another quarterly record in that metric with 38 out of 39 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth.\nWe also set quarterly RPU less fuel records for both industrial products and for automotive. In Intermodal, we realized a 5% year-over-year volume increase with gains in both domestic and international through sales pipeline wins, increased freight demand and empty container volumes.\nPremium continues to face market headwinds. Truck prices remained low, causing domestic intermodal rates to be generally in line with last quarter. However, note that RPU less fuel finished up 2% due to a lift from contract recoveries and rate true-ups.\nLet's turn to coal. Volume decreased 1%, with coal prices driving a 9% decline in revenue. Utility experienced reduced burn demand due to continued low natural gas prices, while lower seaborne prices impacted our export business. Okay. Moving to Slide 11, let's talk about full year results. We achieved a strong 5% volume growth. Overall, revenue was flat as we faced significant fuel headwinds of $261 million along with lower coal rates. The intermodal unit led the company in volume growth and an important bright spot in revenue was the merchandise business unit that achieved record revenue, revenue per unit and RPU less fuel for the full year of 2024.\nLet's go to Slide 12 and look ahead. Our 2025 outlook is for modest volume growth driven by the reliable service product that our customers are enjoying now. For our merchandise markets, we expect lower vehicle production due to weaker-than-expected sales and some inventory build. We expect improved manufacturing activities supported by lower interest rates and strength in our chemicals markets such as plastics and waste.\nHowever, the potential for new tariffs will introduce some near-term uncertainty in the many markets serve. Despite these uncertainties, we are confident that we're well positioned to recapture market share and deliver the value that our customers expect of us. Turning to our intermodal markets. U.S. MX and ILA read a tentative agreement, which helps remove a key source of uncertainty.\nStrong import and export demand has been a growth driver. However, new tariffs will probably create some headwinds. We expect volume growth driven by new business and continued empty repositioning to partially offset these headwinds. Truck pricing has yet to recover, but excess capacity has finally started to come down. We're seeing some gradual improvement in some of the key industry metrics such as increasing tender rejections. And we expect falling export prices in coal along with softer demand for utility in our territory due to lower natural gas prices and generally elevated inventory levels.\nWe're going to continue to keep a close eye on these factors as the year progresses. 2024 was a transformative year for us, and we now have reliable service that's consistent, resilient and is built to grow in the markets that we serve. I just want to end by once again thanking our customers for their partnerships and their trust as we move into 2025. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jason Zampi to review financial results.\n\nJason A. Zampi\n\nTreasurer and Acting Executive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ed. I'll start with Slide 14, which reconciles our GAAP results to the adjusted numbers that I'll speak today. There are 4 items I'd highlight for you. First, a net benefit of $43 million related to the Eastern Ohio incident, insurance recoveries exceeded incremental costs in the quarter. I'll recap where we are with these momentarily. We also recognized a $53 million gain related to the finalization of the Virginia Lionel transaction, the first portion of which was recognized last quarter.\nAdditionally, we continue to sunset certain technology projects resulting in an additional $27 million in restructuring costs. And finally, as we have wound down the proxy campaign and signed the cooperation agreement, you'll note the final tranche of inventory costs incurred below the line in other income.\nAdjusting for these items, operating ratio for the quarter was 64.9%, and EPS came to $3.04. Slide 15 provides a recap of the Eastern Ohio derailment-related financial impacts. You'll see that to date, we have incurred nearly $2.2 billion related to the incident with incremental costs in the current year related to the class action settlement, further environmental remediation efforts and other community assistance.\nHowever, the pace of insurance recoveries accelerated, bringing in $650 million this year alone, and we have now recorded over $750 million in total. Moving to the comparison of our adjusted results versus last year and last quarter on Slide 16. We generated 390 basis points of operating ratio improvement in the face of revenue headwinds, driven by strong productivity gains and that drops down to high single-digit net income and EPS growth.\nFrom a sequential perspective, the operating ratio was up 150 basis points, a little better than we had projected due to the approximate $20 million in contract recoveries that we recognized at the end of the quarter, as Ed just discussed.\nTrailing of the $153 million of year-over-year expense decline on Slide 17, you'll note improvements in all expense line items, except depreciation, which was up on our larger asset base. Strong productivity improvements within labor and fuel efficiency drove over half of the expense improvement and helped to offset wage inflation and higher incentive comp accruals.\nIn addition, purchased services was down $40 million year-over-year in the face of higher volumetric costs, great progress in this cost category. You'll also note the materials expenses come down as we continue to store locomotives, yet another benefit of our fluid network. Turning to the full year results compared to 2023 on Slide 18. We had guided to a 100 to 150 basis point operating ratio improvement, and you'll see that we exceeded that commitment and delivered 160 basis points of improvement, and that's despite revenue be down slightly.\nIt really comes down to a productivity story. John and his team overdelivered on productivity gains, exceeding our original $250 million target and delivering nearly $300 million of year-over-year cost savings. So we're moving into 2025 with a lot of momentum for fronts, operational, commercial and financial. I'll turn it over to Mark to wrap up and discuss how we're thinking about 2025.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Jason. So you heard about the really strong performance to close out 2024. We have powerful momentum entering 2025. While markets are hard to predict at this point, we will lean into our outstanding service and the resolve of our people to capture share. We made that happen in 2024, and we are confident we will do it again in 2025. Turning now to guidance on Slide 20. We are planning on 3% revenue growth with positive volume and healthy core pricing, more than offsetting headwinds from fuel and coal. One thing fully in our control is productivity.\nWe exceeded our 2024 target of $250 million of cost takeout, and we are again looking to exceed the original $150 million target for 2025. That equation translates to margin expansion of 150 basis points, which is at the high end of our long-term baseline guidance range that called for OR improvements from 100 to 150 basis points per year.\nUltimately, we will continue to close the margin gap with peers whatever the volume environment. CapEx will be in the $2.2 billion range. and with strong free cash flow driven by our operating performance, our balance sheet restoration will be complete in 2025 and allow us to resume share repurchases. So with that, let's get into Q&A."

Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis as referenced in our earnings release.\nTurning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nThank you, Luke, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here with me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier, we reported our second quarter financial results, including adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, net income of $694 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Notably, we delivered 480 basis points of sequential margin improvement on our adjusted operating ratio.\nOR was 65.1% in the second quarter with a first half OR of 67.5%, making good on our commitment to our shareholders to a first half operating ratio in the range of 67% to 68%. Our strong progress over this quarter demonstrates our ability to close the gap to our peers by executing our balanced strategy of service, productivity and growth with safety at it's core.\nThe Thoroughbred team delivered significant margin improvement in the quarter despite revenue headwinds and by accelerating productivity initiatives. As you will hear from John, Ed and Mark, we were able to overcome market weakness through increasingly strong progress on our 6 key operational metrics, by responding to market opportunities and growing volume and remaining laser-focused on controlling costs.\nWe also take seriously our commitment to being the gold standard of safety in the industry. and continue to make progress on improving our safety culture and metrics. This is the strength of our strategy. driving operable excellence and discipline that will deliver and will continue to deliver productivity gains and create the foundation to onboard significant growth when the market returns.\nThis is the flywheel effect that is delivering tangible benefits for customers and shareholders. Efficient operations with a compelling service product allowed our teams to gain share in service-sensitive markets such as auto and intermodal, while participating in spot opportunities in coal and agriculture. As a result, we posted record performance in several key merchandise measures.\nWhile our work continues, our second quarter results represent an encouraging inflection point in our operating performance. We have plenty of runway in front of us. I'm excited for Norfolk Southern's opportunities ahead. We're committed to our strategy and delivering the results with pace and urgency that demonstrate the power of a better way for our employees customers, communities and shareholders.\nI'll now turn it over to John to further discuss our operational progress.\n\nJohn F. Orr\n\nEVP of Operations, Kansas City Southern\n\nThank you, Alan. It's a pleasure to provide an update on our progress. Turning to Slide 5. At NS safety enables performance and our commitment to safety is unwavering. During the quarter, we leveraged our NS leadership framework to strengthen our field safety. We continued our efforts to focus on mainline accident reductions and we commissioned 3 additional inspection portals and added field sensors. These have contributed to our best-in-class mainline accident rate. We also conducted 2 cross-functional leadership safety summits, strengthening our capabilities and reinforcing safety from the ballast to the boardroom.\nTurning to Slide 6. We our metrics improved across all of our core network performance indices. Our balanced approach proved safety, service and cost improvements work best together. Year-to-date, we have reduced our active online motor power fleet by 320 locomotives and have targeted an additional 100 reductions in the second half. As we store locomotives, we use reliability metrics to remove the worst performers, driving up overall fleet reliability and driving down maintenance, materials and fuel expense.\nQuarter-over-quarter, we increased our GTMs for available horsepower by 6% and our car velocity by 6%. Both improvements are the result of design processes that drive out time and cost, both in terminals and over the road. Our strategy includes structural improvements in fuel procurement, materials management, purchase service optimization, crew cost efficiency and productivity enhancements. So let's take a look at a few of the initiatives in the pipeline that are closing the gap as we track for the $250 million cost takeout commitment.\nTurning to Slide 7. We have delivered a 6% improvement in car velocity by reducing handlings, extending train schedules and improving connection performance. Car velocity is something I monitor closely. It captures improvements in our operating plan, terminal execution and over-the-road performance. For example, during the quarter, we eliminated over 700 unnecessary car handlings per day. Driving car velocity in response to overall train speed improvements includes working with our customers to rightsize the inventory in their pipelines as train speed and car velocity improve, fewer cars are required to service the current volume.\nIn the quarter, we delivered a reduction of 3% of cars online. We are improving safety, train speed and service reliability by addressing unscheduled train stops and dispatching practices. For example, our mechanical war rooms root cause analysis of every unscheduled train stop has resulted in an 18% reduction of fees and scheduled stops in Q2. We have a new network operations watchdog team, bringing extreme discipline to planned adherence. They challenged the root cause for every extra train. This has instilled network-wide visibility and accountability to execution and planning. I'm really encouraged that this has increased connections and train yield and has driven out extra train starts from 200 in March to just 50 in June. These improvements to our operating plan and terminal discipline have resulted in a 4% reduction in crew starts.\nThe combination of crew and overtime reductions has dropped our crew expense per KGTM by 8% compared to Q1. As operational effectiveness grows, we are recalibrating our standards and sweating the network resources even further. This is the path to at least 7% to 10% improvement in car velocity. Yard and local redesigns are underway. We are driving out waste and rework in the first mile and last mile operations. We are unlocking the capacity to take on additional work within the same footprint.\nEfficiency in this space is really important to me since we allocate approximately 50% of of crew starts here. Over the next 24 months, we will continue to improve fuel productivity. We will continue to push locomotives, leverage trip optimizer to assertively manage horsepower per ton, turn power more quickly, improve fuel distribution and vendor accountability and increased train size. We are targeting locomotive productivity improvements of an additional 8%.\nOne of my personal objectives is to develop the next generation of skilled PSR railroaders and to build the bench strength to sustain the improvements that I'm leading. We are structuring the organization to drive the daily and strategic outcomes and I am proud and encouraged by the engagement of the people in every department and across the entire organization. The team is working collaboratively and with confidence. Our team is energized and motivated to build upon the strength of the quarter and deliver the next wave of initiatives that will yield savings in all P&L categories beyond just comp and bang but in materials, rents and purchased services, success breeds success.\nI want to close out my remarks on Slide 8 and 9 with 2 flywheel examples of balancing service and cost. In automotive, our car velocity increased by 16%, creating the platform for growth as our carloads increased by 7%. Within intermodal, shipments and service performance simultaneously increased by 8%. This following the 15% lane rationalization we discussed earlier this quarter. And what's really important to me is that we are launching our NS intermodal reservation system in September. This smooth strain demand reduces rents and expenses and creates service certainty.\nOur customers are enjoying some of the best sustained service ever. At the same time, we have consolidated train starts, streamlined our service plan, reduced handling complexity and have driven out cost. We are unlocking tremendous value within our franchise, adding new capability, urgently eliminating waste and driving to a sub-60 OR.\nNow I'll turn it over to Ed.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nVP of Industrial Products, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let's go to Slide 11, and I'll review our commercial results for the second quarter. Overall results were driven by a notably more fluid network that delivered a better service product to our customers. Revenues came in just above $3 billion, a 2% increase versus last year. Volumes rose 5%, led by an 8% increase in intermodal, while RPU fell 3%, driven by unfavorable impacts from intermodal mix. Merchandise revenue improved 4% while volumes increased 2% and RPU rose 3%.\nRPU less fuel increased 4% versus last year, which once again set an all-time record alongside a new all-time record for revenue less fuel. This marks the 36th out of the prior 37 quarters, where merchandise RPU less fuel grew year-over-year. In Intermodal, revenue was flat. Volume increased 8%, and RPU declined 8%. And in coal, revenue declined 3% on a 2% volume decrease. Now these were impacted by the outage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.\nI do want to take a second here to reflect on Kohl's performance in the face of extraordinary challenges around the unprecedented closure of the Baltimore port complex in April. We and our customers demonstrated extraordinary operational agility and creativity to keep global supply chains intact via Lamberts Point, Virginia until service was restored in Baltimore. I'll note that propelling our record merchandise less fuel in the quarter was our automotive book, which set a record for total revenue and RPU less fuel. Metals, which achieved an all-time quarterly record in revenue less fuel and chemicals, which marked an all-time record for RPU less fuel.\nIntermodal revenue was flat in the quarter. However, if we exclude pressure from fuel and storage charges, revenues grew by 2% despite the mix and price headwinds. All of these superlatives are supported by the strong service product that John and his team are delivering.\nLet's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for the rest of '24. We're lowering our expectations for full year revenue growth to around 1% based on continuing market cost currents, and we expect overall adverse mix headwinds to continue. In merchandise, new industrial activity may be constrained by higher interest rates and borrowing costs, but we expect to see continued benefits from ongoing infrastructure and manufacturing projects underway.\nOur improved network fluidity will also deliver growth and unlock shareholder value. Intermodal volumes remain a driver of overall volume growth as international shipments rise through import and export demand while excess capacity and weak truck prices are expected to remain headwinds to domestic volumes. And finally, in coal, we foresee a challenged environment within the utility space continuing, while export markets see some momentum from the reopening of the Baltimore channel and new production.\nAll right. Let's finish up on Slide 13. I'm going to take a minute to highlight a recent win-win with a large met coal producer in the U.S. set to be developed in 2025, our rail lines will link this new coal production facility with the global market. This mine will produce nearly 5 million short tons of premium grade in met-coal annually when it reaches full production.\nThis new partnership is a concrete example of our strategy to grow high-quality carload revenue, close the gap to peers in key markets and significantly enhance our met coal portfolio for years and years to come. This win also demonstrates our customers' confidence in Norfolk Southern in our service and our commitment to our strategy. We're grateful to be chosen for this project, and we're excited for the future of this opportunity.\nInvesting strategic capital to support regions of our network with economic growth is also in motion. The state of Alabama is an example where our investments include terminal and mainline infrastructure projects that support customers as they invest and expand their businesses. These investments are a key part of our balanced approach to deliver top-tier revenue growth over the long term. And finally, I just want to thank our customers for their partnership and for their business.\nI'll now turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Ed, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start on Slide 15 with a quick reconciliation of GAAP results on the left and the adjusted results on the right. You'll see that the Eastern Ohio incident column is actually income in the quarter of $65 million as our $156 million of insurance recoveries exceeded the additional costs that were accrued.\nIn the restructuring column, you will also see income as we booked a favorable true-up to our Q1 separation cost accruals, but also realized an associated favorable postretirement curtailment adjustment within our other income line item. We also highlight under the advisory cost column, the expenses incurred in Q2 associated with the proxy contest. Adjusted results, including a 65.1% OR was in line with our guidance range. $3.06 was aided by $0.05 below the line from a favorable state income tax adjustment.\nOn the next chart, Slide 16, I'll go through the year-over-year and sequential variances compared to the adjusted results. Our second quarter performance was a function of a dose of revenue lift combined with the team making excellent progress on network performance and providing strong service that enabled us to remove cost from our structure. Year-over-year revenue was up $64 million or 2%, with volumes up 5%, but RPU was down 3%. As Ed discussed, adverse mix remained a headwind to RPU in the quarter.\nOperating expenses were down $7 million year-over-year despite inflation headwinds, reflecting strong momentum on cost takeout, which drove 160 basis points of OR improvement. The cost reduction momentum is especially evident when looking at the sequential decline of $119 million or 6% on $40 million more revenue combining to drive up a large 480 basis point sequential reduction in our operating ratio and will most certainly result in a sharp narrowing of the OR gap with the industry.\nDrilling into the revenue change on Slide 17, focusing here on the sequential increase in revenue from Q1 of $40 million. That was driven by merchandise volume growth. Yet despite what appears as a favorable mix shift at the high level, with a 2% rise in merchandise volume, RPU to Q1 was only flat, and that's because mix within each business line was adverse, as you'll see illustrated in the gray box where volume growth of below average RPU business lines exceed volume growth in the above average business lines.\nShifting to a sequential look at operating expense on Slide 18. I'll start by saying it's nice to see all green on this chart. OpEx is down $119 million versus the first quarter. The dramatic acceleration in our network velocity has allowed us to drive out the remaining mitigation costs in the quarter, which shows up in several categories, including comp and ben, most notably over time, but also in equipment rents, purchase services as well as other.\nThe ops team did a terrific job speeding up the network and improving service to deliver on these cost savings as well as fuel efficiency improvements. You'll also see savings in the comp and bend from lower employee levels largely driven from the previously announced downsizing actions that we took in our management ranks, but also sequential attrition of nearly 2% of our T&E workforce.\nProperty gains in the second quarter totaled $25 million compared to 0 in Q1. So the first half is pretty much on a normal annual run rate. Real estate transactions are lumpy and some of you may say that the $25 million in the quarter was 2x a theoretically smoothed amount. But either way you choose to evaluate our results our OR performance in the quarter was in line with our commitment. So we are very encouraged at what is clearly an inflection point in our cost structure allowing us to meet the commitment we made on OR despite a weaker volume environment than we had been planning for, demonstrating organizational agility.\nAs we look to the second half, there are various headwinds and tailwinds to consider. Ed noted that the revenue will be softer than we previously expected, with some sequential volume improvement, but adverse mix. And the industry's next contractual wage increase that took effect on July 1, and creates a $25 million step up in comp and ben here in the third quarter. However, John talked about our actions and momentum on productivity side within operations, and that will help neutralize the wage impact. All that said, the key message I want to leave you with today is that despite softer macro conditions, we are reaffirming our guidance for the second half operating ratio in the 64% to 65% range.\nBefore I hand to Alan, I'll make a comment on capital. Many of you have seen that PSR, there is often a liberation of excess capital assets. That boosts efficiency and creates incremental cash flow streams, adding to shareholder returns. We've had some of those in the past several years with some larger asset sales, and we continue to evaluate opportunities and have a robust list of properties for which we are pursuing sales that will simplify our network and generate cash over the next several quarters. Alan?\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nThanks, Mark. Let's turn to Slide 20. As you heard from Ed, we lowered our full year revenue guidance from approximately 3% to approximately 1% growth. And you heard from John and Mark that we are overcoming the revenue drop with a focus on the significant productivity opportunities in front of us, which gives us the confidence in reaffirming our full year OR guidance. despite the lower revenue outlook. The momentum demonstrated in the second quarter is a testament to the strength of our strategy.\nI want to thank all 20,000 of my Norfolk Southern teammates for all they have done and are doing every single day to deliver on our shareholder commitments and accelerate our operational improvements. John, Ed and Mark have identified specific actions and outcomes to deliver improved results in workforce, T&E, fuel, mechanical, purchase services and rents and capital productivity as well as smart growth in merchandise, intermodal and coal. We have a clear line of sight on multiple initiatives and a road map for margin gains in several key areas over the next 18 months as we close the OR gap. I'm proud of our progress in the second quarter. encouraged by our trajectory and confident in our team's ability to execute and deliver results in the quarters ahead.\nWe will now open the call to questions.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nicholls, you may now begin.\n\nLuke Nichols\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results.\nPlease refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures, including adjusted or non-GAAP operating ratio.\nPlease note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis as referenced in our earnings release. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and our new Chief Operating Officer, John Orr. I'm excited to have John on the Norfolk Southern team. John is a 40-year railroad industry veteran and a proven PSR expert who has worked with Hunter Harrison, Claude Mongeau and Keith Creel to implement PSR railroads across 3 countries. I promised you that we would focus on productivity in 2024, and we're taking action to do just that. bringing in someone of John's caliber was another step to accelerate our operational improvement.\nJohn is going to share the progress in our operating metrics that he and his team are already driving and his plans for furthering productivity in our merchandise network to deliver immediate margin enhancement. Our strategy is about balancing service, productivity and growth with safety at its core. This strategy is anchored on a PSR-driven operating plan and designed to deliver top-tier earnings and revenue growth with industry competitive margins. When we say industry competitive margins has to be within 100 to 200 basis points of the industry average. Let's recall where we've been and discuss our path forward. Last year, in response to East Palestine, we prioritized investments in safety and service to protect our franchise and our shareholders, and we delivered on both fronts. We are operating one of the safest networks in North America and are producing service levels better than anything we've seen since 2019. Despite that progress, more work remains to be done to get us back to industry competitive margins. We were not delivering the productivity, and we were not running fast enough or efficiently enough.\nI needed to make changes to accelerate our progress and to introduce greater operational discipline into our culture. To that end, we started making organizational and process changes last fall, culminating with the recent hiring of John Orr. Now we have safely built the foundation to drive substantial gains in productivity, and we've committed to a 400 to 400 basis point OR improvement in the second half of this year. We will close that margin gap with peers. We will deliver a sub-60 operating ratio in the next 3 to 4 years, and we will do it at a safe, sustainable manner that recognizes our current operating environment and brings key constituents, including our shareholders, customers, employees and regulators along with us on our mission. We will urgently deliver productivity through disciplined operational excellence. That continues to safely serve our customers, positions us to grow by meeting markets as they evolve and allows us to generate outsized returns for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn it over to Mark to review our first quarter financial results.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Alan. As seen on Slide 5, our GAAP results in Q1 were impacted by 4 items that we've called out for you. Earlier in the month, we announced the $600 million agreement in principle to resolve a consolidated class action lawsuit relating to the East Palestine derailment. That addresses the most significant remaining legal exposures for our shareholders. Including other cleanup costs and insurance recoveries in the quarter, our operating income was adversely impacted by $592 million. You'll note at the bottom, another $108 million of insurance recoveries in the quarter. That brings our recoveries to date in excess of $200 million toward our $1.1 billion insurance coverage tower. Moving to the right. We told you last quarter about our initiative to drive a 7% reduction in non-agreement headcount, for which savings will begin to materialize in Q2. That initiative, along with our operations leadership change resulted in a $99 million charge.\nNext, our advisory costs associated with our now very public shareholder matter recorded in nonoperating. Finally, we also called out here a favorable deferred tax adjustment affecting our income tax expense. For the remaining slides, I'll speak to our adjusted results, excluding these items, as shown here on the far right. Moving to Slide 6, let's focus on the adjusted variances compared to Q1 of 2023 and in the year-over-year columns. Those results were impacted by 4% lower revenues driven by meaningfully lower fuel surcharge as well as headwinds in intermodal that Ed will detail later.\nOperating expenses were up 3% from inflation and the increased workforce. You'll see an OpEx year-over-year waterfall in the appendix that provides more detail. Not on this page, is nonoperating income, which was down $17 million from lower gains on our company-owned life insurance. That decline, coupled with the lower operating income drove the net income and EPS reductions you see here on a year-over-year basis. Let's talk on the right side about the sequential variance from Q4 2023, where we guided to a 100 to 200 basis point deterioration in our OR, which is in line with normal seasonality. That's exactly where we landed right at the lower end of that range.\nOn the next couple of charts will detail the sequential revenue and OpEx walks from Q4. So revenue here on Slide 7, moved down sequentially driven by fuel surcharge headwinds and overall lower volumes driven by coal and intermodal. Coal pricing was weaker and Intermodal faced difficult conditions with volumes down 3% and continued adverse mix from softness in our higher-yield premium business.\nSlide 8. Turning to our operating expenses. They were down 1% as compared to Q4. We faced typical sequential headwinds associated with the reset of payroll taxes, and we had meaningful headwinds from returning to normal incentive compensation accrual levels as well as no property sales in the first quarter. We offset those headwinds by lower spend in purchased services efficiency gains in comp embedded as well as favorable fuel prices.\nWhile fuel expense was down 6% sequentially, recall that surcharge revenue was down 17% sequentially, and that drives a 40 basis point OR headwind on a sequential basis. As we turn to the balance of the year, we will see our margins improve materially from here. We are finally starting to see excess service costs unwind and they will accelerate downward in Q2. That trajectory, along with the reduction in non-agreement headcount as well as other productivity initiatives leave us confident in a strong productivity story for Q2.\nWe anticipate a modest seasonal volume lift sequentially, although there is some pressure to our Coal business from the Baltimore Bridge disruption. Despite the port closure, we still believe we will be within the first half 67% to 68% OR guidance range, assuming that the channel reopens at the beginning of June. The revenue impact from the channel closure is in the $25 million to $35 million per month range.\nMore productivity momentum builds in the back half as well as stronger volumes and that provides us with confidence in the 400 to 450 basis points of OR improvement. John will talk more about the productivity runway in front of us.\nBut first, I'll hand over to Ed to discuss revenues.\n\nEd Boyle\n\nThank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the call. Starting on Slide 11, I'll go over our commercial results for the quarter. Overall, volume grew by 4% versus last year, driven by intermodal. Revenue for the first quarter came in just above $3 billion, down 4% year-over-year as total RPU fell 8%.\nStarting with merchandise volume was flat versus last year, while revenue ticked down 1% driven by lower fuel surcharge revenue. RPU less fuel increased by 3% year-over-year setting an all-time quarterly record, which also led to a new all-time quarterly record for revenue less fuel. This marks the 35th out of the prior 36 quarters that merchandise RPU grew year-over-year, and once again, reaffirms our commitment to price and the increasing value of our service. Turning to intermodal. Volume grew 8% year-over-year, primarily on strength in international.\nAs our cross-functional efforts to boost throughput at our Lamberts Point terminal yielded positive results. These results are a great example of all of [indiscernible] pulling together to deliver strong value for our shareholders and for our customers. Let's move to Slide 12, where I'm introducing a new view of our results that helps frame the main first quarter drivers of revenue and revenue per unit. Overall, fuel surcharge revenue was the single largest headwind in the quarter, declining by $115 million.\nThe first quarter was also the last one where intermodal storage and fees are a substantial year-over-year headwind with revenues declining by $35 million. In coal, we experienced positive mix from higher export volumes and higher utility shipments in the South. This positive mix was more than offset by lower realized price and export shipments as seaborne coal prices weakened significantly throughout the quarter.\nMerchandise revenue, excluding fuel, was driven higher by pricing gains across the entire book. Overall pricing and volume increases in our metals franchise were boosted by improved network fluidity from increased car velocity. That same velocity and fluidity helped volumes in automotive remained flat despite manufacturing headwinds at several of the plants that we serve.\nIntermodal revenue, excluding fuel and storage and fees increased as higher volumes more than offset adverse mix and continued slight capacity in the domestic truck market created headwinds to RPU. Higher international shipments and lower domestic premium shipments were the main drivers of adverse mix. Additionally, RPU was impacted from higher international empty shipments as these grew 57% year-over-year in the quarter. We believe elongated ocean transit times are a driving factor pushing ocean carriers to deploy their capacity back on the water as soon as possible, which increases the need to reposition empty containers back to the ports.\nTurning to Slide 13. Let's go over our market outlook for the remainder of '24. The macro landscape presents a mixed bag with uncertainty regarding inflation and future Fed rate actions overshadowing the recent recovery in manufacturing. However, our improving service product places us in an excellent position to capitalize on growth opportunities. Starting with our view on the widely varying merchandise markets, we generally see support from volume from the normalization of auto production and the continued strength in infrastructure projects across our network. A positive price environment will continue, which is supported by the increase in network fluidity. Improved cycle times, equipment availability and network velocity will be a broad positive tailwind across our portfolio and merchandise. And we also expect to drive incremental volumes through project development, such as our recently announced Great Lakes reload acquisition, the merger of TDIS into Triple Crown Services and continued industrial development wins. Intermodal volumes are increase as international trade remains robust.\nWe expect continued mix impacts from higher international empty shipments as geopolitical tensions remain elevated but a weak truck market continues to drive stubbornly low truck rates, which will dampen domestic nonpremium intermodal pricing. Additionally, we expect volumes in our domestic premium business to fall as challenging LTL market forces reduced freight demand for parcel shipments. Finally, coal volumes will be challenged as high stockpiles and low natural gas prices reduce utility shipments. In addition, export shipments will be affected by the Baltimore port shutdown. We are diligently working with our customers to provide alternate supply chain solutions, and the increased network fluidity is providing the capacity necessary to execute on those solutions.\nFinally, seaborne coal prices have weakened as supply has outstripped global demand and this headwind is expected to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Before I turn it over to John, I'd like to close by making our customers for trusting Norfolk Southern to move their freight.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Ed. I arrived at NS in late March and immediately got to work immersing myself in the operations and connecting with our people. I've had boots on the ground assessing terminals and engaging craft colleagues in frontline supervisors. I've also met with our stakeholders from labor, regulatory and community leadership. What I've seen confirms that NS is a robust franchise with a talented team and the resources to deliver impressive results when properly executed. Our safety performance as shown on Slide 15, has trended favorably. I have observed a strong safety commitment, and we are building on that. My first action as COO was a system safety blitz to provide clarity around the value of safety.\nTurning to Slide 16. It is imperative that we closed the profitability gap with our peers. We are now delivering encouraging trends in productivity. Our strategy is balanced for operating efficiency and service excellence are achieved in tandem. Our approach is a flywheel of value creation for people, processes and accountability intersect to drive performance, anchoring our service and profitability proposition. Accountability is key. We're providing our team with the metrics they need to track their performance. In my first 30 days, we have removed approximately 200 locomotives from the available fleet. Most of these have gone into storage status or driven off-line for HPH ballots.\nOur availability count is now below 2,500 units. As shown on the slide, we will be able to increase locomotive drawdown over the next 6 months. Terminal 12 has improved by 8%. We are driving more waste by fine-tuning workload in our terminals through disciplined planned execution. Near term, we are targeting 20% improvement.\nCar miles have improved by 8%. And this is another productivity measure, we target for double-digit improvement. Recrews are trending down 22% as network and terminal improvements are combining to improve fluidity across the main line. And lastly, we are reviewing the entire train service plan. This will drive core rationalization in the range of 4%, resulting from these initiatives, we are driving out excess cost as we close the gap to our peers. Referring to Slide 17, network update. To accelerate improvements and address network underperformance, I have established a network optimization team that identifies areas for immediate improvement. I have deployed 2 task force to drive field productivity and throughput at 2 major terminals.\nThe outcomes from these efforts will rapidly go out to scale throughout the network. We are training our operations leaders to think differently to make faster decisions and to eliminate waste more vigorously. My commitment is to develop PSR railroaders to instill the discipline for continuous improvement and to streamline execution by relentlessly managing assets in context to our commercial obligations. The initial results across the entire network have been promising. Our people are driving PSR results.\nTo create accountability and to track progress, we're introducing a comprehensive set of metrics. I've laid out challenging and urgent near-term targets, and I'm taking an aggressive disciplined approach to achieve our long-term financial glide path. And I can tell you now we have a significant runway on cost reduction. As our fleet becomes more efficient, we benefit in rents and materials by shedding assets and from improving the fleet composition and getting out more costly cars. Our locomotive fleet now has significant capacity. I believe we will be able to scale down discretionary capital spending on the fleet. And we have a robust terminal footprint, covering a rich array of industrial activity. And as we optimize our terminals, we are challenging the historic use to create value through consolidation and efficiencies. I am proud and excited to have the opportunity to lead the operations team at NS. I look forward to your questions, and I will turn the call back to Alan.\nOur strategy is designed to mirror the great success stories of the Canadian railroads who have recognized that PSR is about more than tearing a railroad down to its studs at slashing costs regardless of the fallout. As our Board member, Claude Mageau demonstrated when he was CEO of Canadian National, a PSR operating model, when part of a customer-focused balanced strategy, can deliver top-tier revenue growth and a sub-60 operating ratio. John -- or was an integral part of Claude's leadership team at CN and thus a perfect fit from Norfolk Southern. As we turbocharge productivity in pursuit of industry competitive margins and top-tier earnings growth.\nCore to this are the men and women of Norfolk Southern I'm. Incredibly proud of all they've done to progress the execution of our differentiated strategy. So my colleagues, thank you for everything you do for Norfolk Southern, our shareholders, our customers and your fellow team members. Together, we are on a transformational journey to a safer more profitable railroad, poised for growth with strong execution from an experienced leadership team.\nWe will now open the call to questions.

It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer.\nLast year was historically challenging with a major derailment to start off the year, followed by network disruptions, and compounded by a stubbornly weak freight market. The Eastern Ohio incident tested our resolve. I'm proud that our team responded decisively and responsibly to protect this great franchise and our shareholders, and to address the community's concerns.\nWith an unwavering commitment, we have strengthened our safety and service. We have kept and will continue to keep our promises to make things right in Ohio, to improve our service to our customers, and to make a safe railroad even safer.\nA crisis allows you to accelerate change, and we acted. This includes a number of positive changes to how we design the network and assemble trains with measurable results. As we show on Slide 4, our improvement in safety is already being highlighted by a dramatic 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate in 2023.\n2023 was also historically important for Norfolk Southern because we began to implement and advance our new strategy to position our business for sustainable growth and success. The intermodal service composite chart on the right side of Slide 4 tells an important story that speaks to the clear gains we have made in both resiliency and service following significant strides in service in 2022. With our investments in resiliency through leadership plan and resources, we demonstrated the ability to execute our strategy to run a safer railroad that delivers a compelling service product to our customers and handles increased business, a balanced approach to safely delivering service, productivity and growth.\nWe overcame multiple significant network disruptions in 2023 and exited the year with the best intermodal service we have delivered in over 3 years, all while intermodal volume grew 5%. Entering 2024 with a safer and more fluid network that is attracting growth, we have the platform to narrow our focus to specific areas to drive increased productivity. And we are building positive momentum by executing on our strategic vision.\nPart of that strategic vision is our commitment to industry competitive margins, and we are determined to deliver on that promise just as we have delivered on promises on service and safety as volumes grew.\nWe will leverage our PSR operating plan with our current resource base, to meaningfully improve velocity and resilience within our merchandise network, which accounts for 2/3 of our train starts. As we achieve a high degree of compliance to the plan and merchandise, we will reduce variability, complexity and cost. We are driving that forward now with the results already seen in December and January.\nIt will drive asset velocity that will lead to productivity gains and cost savings. And in 2024, we are targeting a double-digit percentage improvement in terminal dwell, which is a good barometer of the health of our, and fluidity, of our merchandise network. Paul will go into more detail about how we are planning to build on our success in intermodal, deploying changes to accelerate our merchandise network, which I've noted will be a major source of productivity for Norfolk Southern in 2024 and beyond.\nTo further describe what we are doing to improve profitability and drive smart growth in 2024, Ed will talk about how his team is winning business and pushing hard to negotiate price in excess of inflation.\nImportantly, we are streamlining our cost structure and eliminating inefficiencies. We invested in 2023 to enhance safety and service. We will see the benefits of this in our cost structure in 2024. We will take actions this year to reduce costs in other areas. This includes a program to reduce management headcount by roughly 7% to help offset increases in critical operating areas.\nOur groundbreaking transformation will take time. We recognize the necessary investments in resiliency and service had temporarily increased our cost structure, particularly visible during the trough in this freight cycle.\nOn Slide 5, you'll see we laid out the scenario where during a down cycle we may modestly underperform in order to be coiled to secure volume and incremental margin when the freight cycle recovers. While we didn't expect 2023 to be a continuation of a soft rate market, coupled with numerous disruptions, we are optimistic that recovery is on the horizon and our investments will yield returns. We will deliver near-term margin improvement as we implement our strategic vision: a balance between safe service, productivity and smart growth.\nWe are on the path to achieve that balance. In the aftermath of the derailment and network disruptions, we have improved safety and service in a responsible manner and are in securing new business with a stabilized network and a high degree of compliance to the plan. We will continue to iterate the plan, reducing complexity and enhancing executability and balance. All of this will unlock productivity and fluidity, which, in line with our strategy, will allow us to attract more volume at accretive incremental margins and deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry competitive margins.\nWith strong franchise advantages that will serve us well as we move through this economic cycle, we are poised for a bright future as we balance safe service, productivity and growth.\nI'll turn it over to Mark and the rest of the team, who will add some context around the timing and magnitude of our planned improvements in performance and profitability.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7 with an update on our costs related to the Eastern Ohio derailment.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we reached a significant milestone with the bulk of the [ soil ] remediation being completed. It's an encouraging achievement. However, as you'll note, we incurred $137 million charge in the quarter, which related to an extension of the time line for ongoing testing as well as additional work that will be completed in nearby streams. There was another $89 million incurred in legal costs and other fees. But of note, we received $76 million of insurance recoveries, bringing the total recoveries in 2023 to just over $100 million. From a cash perspective, the net outflow in 2023 was $652 million after the insurance recoveries.\nWhile we're pleased with our remediation accomplishments, we currently expect ongoing monitoring efforts and cleanup efforts will continue through 2024. There will be additional costs in the future related to legal settlements and fees, although the amounts and timing cannot currently be estimated.\nMoving to Slide 8, where we illustrate the impact of these fourth quarter results on our results. Our GAAP results are in the first row. While on Row 2 we isolate the accounting to our Q4 financials related to the incident, at the bottom of the chart you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted results to prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion.\nRevenues were down nearly 5%, while adjusted operating expense was 3% higher. The adjusted operating ratio for Q4 2023 was 68.8%, which represented a year-over-year deterioration, but notably was a 30 basis point sequential improvement from our third quarter performance. The sequential improvement is encouraging, but we fell short of our expectations as service-related costs did not come down as we anticipated.\nWhile our recovery efforts related to the IT outages in late Q3 restored service quickly for our customers and allowed us to handle more business, it cost more money in the form of crew-related expenses that persisted well into the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 19% year-over-year. Net income and EPS were down 19% and 17%, respectively.\nTurning now to Slide 9. Adjusted operating expense for the quarter was up $59 million. The increase, excluding fuel decline, was up $123 million. The largest drivers of the increase were employment growth as well as inflation across all categories. In comp and ben, looking to '24, we plan to keep overall head count levels flat versus the year-end '23 exit rate, with some additional mechanical craft hiring to be offset by upcoming reductions in the nonagreement category that Alan discussed.\nPurchased services was up due to higher costs associated with technology spend as well as increased mechanical services, including repairs around our auto fleet as we prepare for growth opportunities in 2024. The increase in rents was driven by short-term locomotive resources and increased car supply for our auto fleet.\nWe expect quarterly rents in 2024 to remain slightly above these fourth quarter levels due to more adverse TTX equity costs and volume metric related increases, partially offset by benefits coming from improved velocity. The increase in materials relates to locomotive and freight car repairs. Claims were lower year-over-year. Recall that in Q4 2022, we had a large adverse adjustment. The other component is unfavorable, driven mainly by fewer real estate gains.\nMoving now to Slide 10. Last quarter, we introduced this slide to help investors think about our service costs and resiliency investments, which are 2 components of our current cost structure. On the left side, we see costs that should not be part of our cost structure and have grown out of service that has not met planned levels, mainly related to recrews and overtime. These costs did not step down as expected in Q4 due to the crew-related costs we incurred to accelerate service recovery for our customers after the IT outages. So while service has been at strong levels exiting the year, Q1 costs will remain somewhat elevated in part from the cold weather we are seeing here in January. Overall service costs should meaningfully unwind in Q2.\nOn the right hand, we show costs tied to our investments in resiliency, mainly related to additional T&E crews that we have added in locations where we were understaffed as we position Norfolk Southern to realize outsized growth in revenue and margin in a growing volume environment. Our total T&E headcount is now at an appropriate level that will allow us to absorb volume growth in '24 and beyond.\nThere will be some additional hiring in mechanical crafts that will be offset by reductions in non-agreement positions. The additional craft hires mean that resiliency costs will settle in roughly in the $55 million per quarter range in 2024. Adding those resources will drive benefits over time of being an even safer and higher-velocity operation.\nMoving to Slide 11 and results below operating income. Other income of $38 million was up $4 million in the quarter, driven by higher interest income on the extra cash we are carrying ahead of the CSR closing. The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.2%, due to a rate adjustment on our deferred state income taxes and tax-free gains on favorable company-owned life insurance. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the usual 23% to 24% range.\nTurning to Slide 12 and recapping our full year results. We started the year planning for modest top line growth that would afford a level of expense growth to help drive our strategic track toward resiliency. The disruptive events of the year and an adverse macro environment upended this. Revenue declined 5%, which was meaningfully affected by about 6 points of pressure from lower fuel surcharge revenue and a sharp year-over-year decline in storage fees. At the same time, OpEx rose 5%, fueled by inflation and investments in our business.\nAs a result, operating income fell 18%, with the operating ratio rising to 67.4%. Favorable below the line items and benefits from share repurchases held the EPS decline to 15%.\nIn 2023, free cash flow was $1.4 billion lower than the prior year. representing the impact of the $650 million derailment-related outlays, as well as the lower operating income, coupled with higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions in '23 were $1.8 billion, with 2/3 being driven by our rock-solid dividend and the remainder from share repurchase activity.\nI'll mention that we did issue debt in November and built up our cash balance to $1.6 billion at year-end as we prepare to fund the strategic CSR purchase that is scheduled to close on March 15. As a result, we will see higher interest expense in 2024, and we will temporarily suspend share repurchases while we absorb the asset and bring our credit metrics back into our target range.\nIt's important to remember that CSR is a highly strategic, critical artery in our network, for which we had a rare window to secure and guarantee control of the asset forever. This also enables us to control longer-term costs that could have begun to escalate sharply with the upcoming lease renewal.\nI'll now hand over to Paul, who can provide an update on our operations.\n\nPaul B. Duncan\n\nSVP Transportation & Network Operations, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark, and good morning. Turning to Slide 15 to begin our operations discussion with safety.\nWe made progress in enhancing safety in 2023. We finished the year with our second best injury rate in 8 years, but we are striving for better. We enhanced our conductor training program and continue to leverage our partnership with [ Atkins Nuclear ], a foremost expert in safety across all industries. We also closed 2023 with a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate and the fewest mainline accidents since 1999. Thank you to all of our craft colleagues and leaders for enhancing safety at Norfolk Southern this last year.\nWhile these are very noteworthy accomplishments, we must become even safer. When the major incident in Eastern Ohio happened in early 2023, we were already in the process of reviewing and adjusting our train makeup rules, and it was a high priority of mine. We ended up accelerating network by a lot. What we produced was an even better product than we already had, which helped us make such progress in mainline accidents, and we are striving to become even safer. This is the platform for which we can now lever up our train plan to deliver productivity and growth.\nThough the change in our operating rules was implemented on an accelerated time line and caused network disruption we know it was the right move for the long term, and we kept our promises to restore fluidity and service levels in the second half of 2023. The future of our operation is very bright, and I am proud of the work we did in 2023 on this front to keep our promises.\nMoving to Slide 16 for further discussion on service levels. We took a modest step backwards to begin the quarter related to the system outages that we experienced but quickly regain footing and continued our glide path of improvement in November and December. It is important to note that we deliberately chose to deploy additional resources so that we could balance restoring fluidity while delivering peak volume.\nWe were successful on that front. We delivered a very strong service for our intermodal customers during peak season and pushed overall volumes to their highest levels in over 2.5 years, as you will hear more about from Ed. But as you heard from Mark, it did result in higher-than-planned service recovery costs in the quarter. We remain sharply focused on reducing those and have actively been unwinding more T&E crew expense in recent weeks in areas such as temporary deployments, overtime, recrews and other crew-related expenses. This has included reducing our intensity of Go Team members deployed on the network.\nNow that we have made this next step function improvement in intermodal service, we expect to remain there as we transition to leveraging our resources to drive greater productivity and growth.\nTurning to Slide 17 for a discussion on productivity. We've improved 4% sequentially within workforce productivity and expect an improving glide path to continue. We are driving this in 4 ways: one, by improving fluidity; two, by maintaining strict discipline and accountabilities to plan compliance in our operations; three, through discrete productivity initiatives that we'll discuss in a moment; and finally, through converting trainees to productive employees.\nAs promised last quarter, we ended the year with 600 conductor trainees. We are now confident with the overall size of our T&E workforce to efficiently serve the growth that is on the horizon.\nOn the locomotive front, referencing our service commentary, miles per day remained lower as we kept additional power and service to jump start the network with peak volume. This is an area that will benefit significantly from further improvements in velocity as faster train speeds allow us to drive our locomotives in the terminals on time and send them back out on their scheduled connections.\nAnd lastly, fuel efficiency finished flat despite the additional locomotives online, thanks to our initiatives. And this is an area we are intensely focused on improving in 2024.\nMoving to Slide 18. The next phase of our operational improvement will be marked by enhancing the velocity and resilience within our merchandise network. Recall that our [ Top SPG ]operating plan, which we launched in 2022, brought further PSR principles to our intermodal network, driving enhancements to container velocity and resilience with intermodal. That successful evolution enabled intermodal service to remain strong throughout 2023, particularly in Q4 where we delivered the best intermodal service in over 3 years while delivering on peak season.\nNow we are building on that success with further enhancements in our merchandise network. First, we are improving our execution and discipline to run with a higher level of plan compliance. We're tying together the improvements we've made around our operational strategy leadership accountabilities and resource allocation by sweating our assets further, and strict execution to the plan.\nNext, we are leveraging precision train building processes embedded into our terminals to optimize connections and depart trains on time. We're already seeing the benefits that arise from success in driving scheduled network velocity.\nOur success will be demonstrated by making sustained improvement in terminal dwell, where, as Alan mentioned in his opening remarks, we expect to drive a low double-digit percentage improvement in 2024 versus 2023. Investors can also track our progress in the AAR train speed, particularly the subset of manifest train speed, which has an outsized impact on our cost structure, as well as merchandise trip lane compliance and car velocity, the outcomes of improving speed, dwell and disciplined execution of plan. Of course, there is always week-to-week noise in these measures, so we would look for improvements in trends on a rolling 12-week basis.\nOn Slide 19, I'd like to provide more detail on how sustaining these velocity improvements will drive down our cost structure. First, we will see reductions in various buckets of T&E related expense, and that will also help to lower our headcount intensity. Next, as we spin up the flywheel, we'll get cars moving faster, a critical element to scheduled rarity and overall productivity.\nHaving our yards in mainlines more fluid will indicate that cars are flowing unimpeded through the network. This will drive a capacity and productivity dividend within our fleets, in our yards and on our main lines. That, in turn, will allow us to bring on growth at low incremental cost, lifting the overall workforce and locomotive productivity and achieving service resilience that will allow us to take further share from truck.\nDriving these benefits into our operation by improving the velocity and resilience of the merchandise network will be a key aspect of delivering progress in 2024. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nVP of Industrial Products, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 21, let's cover our commercial results for the fourth quarter.\nOverall volume improved 3%, led by growth in intermodal and our automotive markets. Now despite volume growth, total revenue and revenue per unit declined for the quarter due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and intermodal storage and fees, along with negative shipment mix within the portfolio continuing from last quarter, as well as headwinds from a weak truck price environment due to the persistent overabundance of capacity.\nLooking at merchandise, volume was flat compared to the prior period, and revenue was challenged by lower revenue from fuel surcharge compared to that prior period. RPU less fuel increased 1% as price gains more than offset the impacts from negative mix. This increase set a new quarterly record for Norfolk Southern and marks the 34th of the last 35 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in merchandise RPU less fuel.\nWe're committed to driving value through price, and this commitment is demonstrated through quarterly record set in our automotive market for revenue, revenue less fuel, revenue per unit, and revenue per unit less fuel.\nLet's move to intermodal. Volume in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year, with gains in both our domestic and international lines of business. Revenue for intermodal was down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significantly lower revenue from storage and fees in the prior period. Also lower fuel prices and an excess supply of available trucks as well as negative mix within our international business impacted revenue per unit negatively. Excluding the impacts of fuel and elevated storage and fees, which are related to supply chain congestion, intermodal RPU declined 1% in the quarter.\nWe're confident our domestic franchise is a coiled spring, positioned to yield strong incremental value as the truck market recovers.\nTurning to coal. Overall volume increased slightly, with strong demand for export more than offsetting declines in our utility coal franchise. The market for utility confronted persistently high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Coal revenue was down 4% year-over-year, with lower commodity prices and lower revenue from fuel surcharge negatively impacting RPU.\nNow let's turn to Slide 22 and review results for the full year. Total volume came in at 6.7 million units, a 1% decrease from 2022. Volume declines were most significant in intermodal and our energy-related chemical commodities. On the positive side, lower ocean freight rates, advanced demand for international intermodal and rising vehicle production activity drove growth in our automotive franchise, both of which contributed meaningfully to offsetting larger declines.\nRevenue for the year was $12.2 billion, down 5% or $590 million from 2022, driven by lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage fees as well as lower volume. I do think it's important to point out, however, that if we exclude the $650 million revenue hit from fuel and storage fees, which is essentially a post-pandemic normalization of those items, underlying revenue was actually positive, even with volume down 1%, which speaks to our commitment to core pricing smart growth.\nRPU excluding fuel, intermodal storage and fees increased 2% as we realized above budget price results in merchandise and in coal. In fact, we set annual records for merchandise revenue, revenue less fuel and RPU less fuel.\nObjectively, the freight environment in 2023 was soft with weak demand for goods, lower levels of manufacturing activity and generally less freight coming in from overseas. These conditions amplified the excess capacity in transportation pressuring margins and growth opportunities.\nOur focus throughout the year was creating value with a resilient network to drive growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw that growth materialize with improved volume, and that volume will bolster our revenue performance in the coming year as we execute our pricing strategy to grow core revenue per unit.\nLet's look ahead to 2024 on Slide 23. Our market outlook is for modest volume growth. In merchandise markets, overall volume growth is expected to be driven by gains in steel shipments. Automotive will grow on continued strength in vehicle production, including new EV business. Improved fluidity and increased network velocity will lift our effective capacity in both of these markets.\nShifting to intermodal, we are optimistic that increasing levels of international trade will boost demand for both our domestic and international services. There's still uncertainty around how quickly capacity in the truck market rightsizes. Additionally, the strength of the consumer could pressure growth if the economy softens.\nLastly, our coal outlook is for relatively flat volume levels compared to last year. Demand for export coal is forecasted to be high, but some of this demand will be met via a shift of historically domestic coal to export markets. Utility demand will be driven by stockpile levels, which are forecast to remain elevated in 2024, aside from extreme weather events.\nLooking at price we expect strong pricing conditions in our merchandise markets, aided by our improved service product. However, as mentioned, a persistently weak truck market will mute the opportunity for intermodal price with contract truck rates expected to trend roughly sideways from their current levels throughout 2024. We also faced some headwinds on coal pricing this year related to difficult comparisons for seaborne coal prices, with additional pressure from high stockpiles and weak natural gas prices.\nAll said, we still expect to generate pricing above rail inflation in 2024. When we take all this together, we are reasonably confident that overall market fundamentals will create opportunities for us to bring on new freight and further the volume trend we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023, while delivering incremental top line revenue growth through core pricing gains as we price into the value of our enhanced service product.\nFinally, let's turn to Slide 24. I'd like to give you some examples of how our customer-centric approach is yielding smart and sustainable growth. Last February, our team met with FedEx Ground with the intent to enhance Norfolk Southern service for their transportation network. We listened to their business forecast and made strategic adjustments that we knew would set us up to better serve this valued customer. We charted a better way forward for both of our organizations. As a result, we were able to significantly increase our volume for FedEx Ground during peak season. And we look forward to continuing that growth into the future.\nWe also landed a new plastic recycling plant in Ohio with our new customer, Pure Cycle, which is expected to launch this quarter. This is a great example of the circular loop that is possible within the plastic supply chain and how Norfolk Southern can deliver that resin in a carbon-friendly manner.\nFinally, 2023 was another successful year for the Norfolk Southern Industrial Development team. We partnered with 62 customers to facilitate the completion of strategic industrial development projects in 2023. Collectively, these projects represent $3.1 billion in customer investment and the creation of more than 4,150 new jobs along Norfolk Southern lines.\nAs we look into 2024, we're encouraged by the continued robust pipeline of customers that are looking to locate facilities along our lines. These successes in 2023 are indicative of the success that we expect in '24 and demonstrates our strategy to deliver a better way forward for our customers, our communities and for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Alan.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nWe overcame a number of challenges in 2023 and we are moving forward with confidence. Our resolve to deliver on all aspects of our strategy has never been stronger. We restored service and improved safety in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and long-term shareholder value. We ended 2023 with the best intermodal service we've seen in years and with an encouraging 5% increase in intermodal volume. Now we enter 2024 with a fluid network, which will drive productivity gains and further growth this year.\nTurning to our outlook. We anticipate roughly 3 points of revenue growth in 2024. This growth, combined with our productivity initiatives, will yield strong accretive incremental margins with operating income growing in excess of revenues.\nNet income and EPS growth will be suppressed in 2024 versus 2023, owing to higher interest expense from the highly strategic acquisition of CSR, along with the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. As for the progression through the year, typical seasonality suggests that second quarter and third quarter should be our strongest in terms of margin performance. Obviously, the first quarter will have some industry-wide impact, from widespread cold weather in January, and our first quarter still has year-over-year headwinds from storage fees, fuel revenue and export coal price.\nIn line with the Investor Day guidance, over the midterm horizon, we anticipate delivering strong incremental margins, presuming a normal freight cycle and mix and 3 to 4 points of revenue growth. A combination of volume absorption, productivity initiatives and a commitment to cost control will be key drivers. We aren't going to give you a specific margin target, but it should result in between 100 to 150 basis points of margin improvement annually, on the pathway to narrow the margin gap with peers and deliver industry competitive margins. You'll start to see progress along those lines in 2024 once we lap some of the revenue compare challenges in the first half.\nWe see a path to outsized gains on the up cycle, leveraging volume growth within existing resources, ample productivity runway, and strong core pricing that can outpace inflation pressures. As we narrow our margin gap over time, the secular growth prospects of our powerful franchise will deliver shareholder value through earnings momentum and free cash flow generation.\nAnd with that, let's open the call for questions."

Welcome to the Norfolk Southern Corporation's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols, you may now begin.\n\nLuke Nichols\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.\nOur presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures.\nTurning to Slide 3. It's now my distinct honor to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our discussion of third quarter earnings. Here with me are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer.\nI want to begin by thanking my Norfolk Southern colleagues for working safely, serving our customers and driving our strategic plan forward. When we charted a new course in the industry, we understood unlocking the full potential of our powerful franchise would require an enhanced focus on resilience and operational excellence across every aspect of our business. Our transformation into a more customer-centric operations-driven service organization reveals opportunities to strengthen our franchise. We saw some of that in the third quarter with 2 technology outages. The first on August 28, was caused by a defect in the vendor software. The second on September 29, involved a firmware maintenance issue. These incidents were unrelated and were not cybersecurity issues.\nWe are taking measures to prevent a reoccurrence and importantly, we are not stopping there. We have launched a top-to-bottom review of our technology infrastructure with the assistance of leading third-party experts. Operations driven means pursuing operational excellence in every aspect of our business and that includes IT. Demonstrating our progress in building resiliency, our strengthened operations leadership, enhanced operating plan and greater crew capacity, enabled us to manage the technology incidents with limited disruption to our customers and grow volume through the service recovery.\nThroughout the third quarter, we continue to do exactly what we said we'd do when we announced our strategy. We are making smart investments in safe, reliable and resilient service. Although the macroeconomic environment of abnormally low volumes is an unwelcome headwind, it has not changed our approach or diminished our confidence that our strategy is a better way forward. The market will recover, and we will be poised and leveraged to capture growth with strong incremental margins. Mark will provide detail on other cost drivers in the quarter, including fuel prices and higher labor costs as a result of last year's historic wage increase for our craft colleagues.\nThese costs combined with investments in our strategy and the backdrop of historically low volumes in the quarter contributed to significant pressure on our operating ratio, which deteriorated year-over-year and sequentially. We are clearly not satisfied with these results. We will recover from these short-term impacts to our operating ratio. As we articulated when we launched our strategy, continuous productivity improvement is a core element of our balanced approach. We are committed to achieving and maintaining industry competitive margins over the long term.\nOur focus on productivity is unrelenting. Under the strong leadership of Paul and his team in Operations, we have an increasingly stable network with a high degree of plan compliance allowing us to iterate the plan for service and productivity. And as Paul will describe, we are reducing our pipeline of conductor trainees through year-end to more normal levels, among other steps, balanced against the challenges of the quarter. There were several encouraging developments that demonstrate progress on our strategy and point to growth and profit improvement in the quarters ahead.\nNotably, Service in the third quarter improved both year-over-year and sequentially, allowing us to onboard more business. Volume improved as well and appears to have turned a corner with each of the last 4 weeks, running above 136,000 carless. That's a level we haven't seen consistently since the second quarter of 2022. In part, this was a function of customers awarding us new business. Our customers see the commitment we are making to deliver more consistent, reliable service, and our marketing team is creating innovative solutions to amplify the value of that service even in a weak freight environment. Ed will talk more about this later.\nIn addition to service and volume gains, we delivered improvements in safety as well. Our mainline train accident rate is down more than 40% year-over-year as we strengthen our safety culture and performance. In East Palestine and the surrounding communities, we continue to deliver on our commitments. Mark will provide an update on costs associated with our ongoing efforts to make things right. I visit regularly as we make significant progress cleaning the site and investing in the community's future.\nI'll now turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 5 with an update on our accruals related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. We are pleased to report that we will be completing soil removal from the derailment site shortly, but expect that there will be ongoing testing efforts to ensure continued safety of the air, soil and water through April of 2024. And as such, we accrued $118 million in Q3 to account for this time line extension. Additionally, we recorded another $70 million for legal and other costs incurred in the quarter. Of note, we did file our initial claim for reimbursement with our insurers during the third quarter, and we'll continue to file claims as costs accumulate. We did receive notification of our first reimbursement under our policy of $25 million and accordingly recognized this as an offset to the cost incurred in the third quarter. The cash was actually received last week.\nWhile we are encouraged by the speed of this initial reimbursement, there are dozens of parties sharing exposure at 10 layers in the insurance tower. So we expect this cost recovery process to be protracted. Also, of the $966 million recorded as expense thus far, just more than half has been paid through September 30th. Of the remaining $450 million, I'd expect roughly half to be spent in the fourth quarter and the rest to be spent in 2024.\nI will remind you that this situation remains fluid, and we will continue working through these issues for many quarters to come. We expect that there will be additional costs that have not yet been incurred related to future settlements, fines and penalties as well as legal fees, and we cannot predict the amount at this time.\nMoving to Slide 6, where we illustrate the impact of these third quarter costs on our results. Our GAAP results are in the first row, while on row 2 we isolate the accounting to our Q3 financials related to the incident and our response. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted financial results to the prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion.\nRevenues were down 11%. Adjusted operating expense was down modestly. The adjusted operating ratio for Q3 was 69.1%, which notably includes 270 basis points of headwind from net fuel price impacts. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 28%. Net income and EPS were down 37% and 35%, respectively. But recall last year, we enjoyed a benefit from a state income tax change of $136 million distorting the year-over-year comparison.\nLet's turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our operating revenues. And it's a quick look at the drivers of the revenue change from last year in advance of Ed getting into the market details. The biggest driver in the year-over-year revenue decline is the meaningful reduction in fuel surcharge revenue. Volumes were down 2%, which equates to a $74 million revenue decline, and we are highlighting here the reduction in intermodal storage revenue of $71 million as we are now back to more normal levels and will continue to have tough compares through Q1 of 2024. Ed will talk later about the traction we have on pricing as well as mix dynamics in the quarter that collectively inform the positive $27 million of rate mix and other.\nOn Slide 8, let's drill into the operating expenses. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were down $19 million or 1% on a year-over-year basis. Fuel expense was down $94 million or 25%, driven mainly by lower fuel prices. Comp and Ben was down $20 million or 3% year-over-year as higher pay rates and employee levels were offset by a favorable comparison with Q3 last year from the $85 million charge we took related to the retroactive wage accruals.\nDepreciation expense was up in line with our earlier guidance. Purchased services was up due to higher costs associated with engineering activities on our network as well as technology spend. The increase in materials and other was up $42 million and driven primarily by an adverse comp on a favorable legal settlement last year as well as higher consumption of materials for locomotive repairs. Property sales were also lower this quarter.\nMoving to Slide 9. While we expect costs related to the past service issues to begin unwinding in the third quarter, additional service challenges in the quarter resulted in a delay with only moderate easing. We expect the unwind to accelerate here in the fourth quarter. Now offsetting these fourth quarter savings will be an increase in incremental costs related to building resiliency in a couple of key areas that will pay dividends in the years ahead.\nFirstly, there are investments in the continuation of our hiring in locomotives in order to support both future growth and faster recoveries. Second, are the investments in our craft workforce, including the quality of life enhancements like paid sick leave. These investments overall should allow for the accommodation of higher volumes that will help cover these costs, along with more productivity.\nOn Slide 10, let's talk to a couple of P&L items below operating income. Other income was up $42 million in the quarter, driven by favorable returns from our company-owned life insurance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7%, in line with what we normally guide.\nAnd turning to free cash flow and shareholder distributions on Slide 11, through the first 9 months, free cash flow was $1.1 billion lower than prior year, with half due to derailment-related expenditures and the remainder from a combination of lower core operating results and higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions over the same 9 months were $1.4 billion, thanks to our solid dividend and continued share repurchase activity.\nI will remind that the citizen vote in Cincinnati to approve the proposed $1.6 billion purchase of the CSR asset will take place in November. So we are reserving capital capacity for that potential transaction, which would close in mid-March of 2024.\nI'll now hand off to Paul to provide an update on our Operations.\n\nPaul B. Duncan\n\nSVP Transportation & Network Operations, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. At Norfolk Southern, everything starts with safety. So let's turn to Slide 13 for an update.\nIn the quarter, we have made significant strides. Our injury rate is up slightly versus last year, but has improved 30% from where we were just 3 years ago. Our accident rate is trending down from where we have been in the past 2 years, and we also continue to maintain a significant reduction in our mainline accident rate through the many efforts and initiatives we have put forth, including the enhancements to our train makeup rules implemented earlier this year. While those enhancements required a significant period of operational adjustment earlier this year, they are now paying off in terms of our mainline accident rate improvement.\nWe also remain very focused on reducing exposures and improving outcomes in our yard and terminal operations. We have made further investments in our people, including enhancements to our training and PPE programs as well as leadership development. On all of these fronts, the results are encouraging, but we are not satisfied and will continue to drive towards our goal of being the industry leader in safety.\nTurning to Slide 14 for an update on Service. This is another area where we have made sustained progress this last quarter. Train speeds have resumed the improving trajectory they were on before our challenging second quarter. We have also pushed to reduce dwell and improved schedule rigor in our terminals, which will now improve to its best level in 2 years. We're sustaining this progress in October while bringing weekly car loadings up to their highest level since Q2 2022 and while developing new service offerings that Ed will outline.\nAs part of our scheduled railroad model though, we will drive further progress. We have to continue to minimize car dwell, maximize velocity across the railroad, sustain safe, reliable and resilient service and drive productivity. On the next 2 slides, we will cover how we plan to accomplish this.\nTurning to Slide 15. Our locomotive velocity was flat year-over-year. Now that we are seeing improvements in train velocity and terminal dwell, this is an opportunity we are focused on driving further velocity and productivity in. As our terminal discipline initiatives take further hold and its network velocity takes the next step above 21 miles per hour, we expect to see this metric improve along with fuel efficiency as we bring additional tonnage onto the network. We now have a qualified T&E workforce that is sized appropriately in aggregate, although we are still investing to get them all in the right locations. We're on track to have our conductor training pipeline below 600 by year-end as indicated last quarter. As our initiatives take hold and as GTMs increase, this measure of productivity will improve from here.\nMoving to Slide 16 to discuss how we are driving service improvement aligned with our scheduled railroad model and how it will translate into additional gains in resilience, productivity and ultimately, growth. First is disciplined terminal execution. This starts with strict adherence to the operating plan to ensure trains are arriving on plan to balance terminal flows in both our merchandise yards and intermodal facilities. We're minimizing dwell by switching cars within 6 hours of arrival. At our Intermodal facilities, it's ensuring we're driving precision execution to the trip plan of containers and leveraging our high-frequency Intermodal model. It involves maximizing connection performance, getting the right cars on the right train and departing our trains on time.\nThe second bullet point. We are driving a culture of strict compliance to the operating plan, both at the train car and intermodal unit level and expect that this will drive further reductions in dwell and even greater consistency in our terminals. Next, we're investing in our people and modernizing our workforce to become more resilient and productive. For example, 250 conductors are receiving locomotives engineered training this year. This gives us resilience and flexibility to fill assignments whether the need is an engineer or a conductor while protecting future growth with an investment today. We are moving forward with the first phase of extra board consolidations, cross-training 260 employees at 7 key terminals across the network.\nLet me explain what this is. As railroads and labor agreements evolved and merged over the decades, territorial boundaries remain to have prevented certain employees from working assignments that were within their geography. At many of these locations, we've worked collaboratively with labor to remove those boundaries, but have yet to get folks qualified to work all potential assignments. With our new focus on resilience, we're investing in our craft employees and getting them qualified to hold more assignments providing them with greater work opportunities and offering Norfolk Southern enhanced operational flexibility and efficiency.\nTo complement these labor modernization efforts, we are implementing predictable work scheduling. A groundbreaking work life balance initiative negotiated with our craft colleagues, which will also streamline our back-office crew management functions and drive further productivity.\nLastly, we are kicking off a system-wide initiative that will drive productivity and enhance our first-mile last-mile service. This is a substantial initiative aligned with delivering reliable service, productivity and most importantly, driving additional growth to the network.\nTo close, running a safe, reliable and resilient scheduled railroad using these principles is going to improve service consistency, generate greater productivity and create capacity for growth.\nI'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nVP of Industrial Products, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Now before we get into the numbers, I want to call out the collaboration between our teams and Marketing and Operations as we improve service and innovate solutions to deliver value for our shareholders and for our customers. I'll talk about it more as we move along here, but I think it's important to recognize the steady progress that we're seeing deep in these organizations that's starting to pay off.\nLet's start on Slide 18 and review our results for the third quarter. Norfolk Southern volumes and revenue was down 2% and 11%, respectively, year-over-year in the third quarter. Revenue declines outpaced volume due to lower fuel surcharge and intermodal storage revenue compared to the prior period. Within merchandise, weakness in several energy markets was the leading driver of a 3% decline in total volume. Crude oil shipments were challenged by unfavorable fuel price differentials that discourage crude by rail to East Coast refineries that we serve. Also, low natural gas prices negatively impacted shipments of sand and NGLs. Helping to offset those declines in energy markets with strength in automotive, where volume increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter.\nGrowth was driven by continued strength and demand for finished vehicles as well as high shippable ground counts. Merchandise revenue was down 7% due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and lower volume. However, revenue per unit, excluding fuel, set a new record as it improved 3%, showing sustained price and mix improvement. This quarter marks 33 out of the last 34 consecutive quarters where we've been able to achieve year-over-year growth in merchandise revenue per unit excluding fuel.\nMoving on to Intermodal. Volume was down slightly compared with last year as growth in international Intermodal largely offset declines in domestic. On the domestic side, persistently abundant truck capacity and weak freight demand challenge volume. While on the international side, volume improved as customers continued to return freight to IPI service. Intermodal revenue was down 22% as revenue per unit, excluding fuel, declined 15%. Lower Intermodal storage fees represented more than 2/3 of this decline followed by adverse mix effects from strong international volumes and the impact of persistent competitive pressure in a loose trucking environment. We're also seeing negative mix effects within the international business.\nFirst, shippers are returning to lower yielding short-haul lanes that shifted to the highway during the pandemic; and second, growth in lower-yielding empty shipments is also outpacing loaded shipments. Intermodal storage has returned to a normal level, and we expect to lap this headwind in the second quarter of next year.\nLastly, within coal, volume dropped 9% year-over-year with weak conditions in our utility markets, which more than offset strength in our export markets. Utility coal volume was down roughly 26% from prior year levels. driven by high stockpiles and low natural gas prices and prolonged customer and producer outages. Export volume increased year-over-year driven by strong Asian demand. Coal revenue declined 8%, primarily due to lower volume. Revenue per unit excluding fuel set a new record and revenue per unit also increased as positive mix and stronger-than-expected seaborne coal pricing and modest liquidated damages more than offset a decline in fuel surcharge revenue.\nTurning to Slide 19. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see slow volume recovery amid uncertain economic conditions. September presented us with some encouraging data that the contraction in manufacturing is slowing and onshoring to the U.S. is on the rise. However, we remain cautious in our optimism as uncertainty surrounding future Fed actions, strike outcomes and geopolitical tension is very pronounced.\nAlthough the macro environment is unclear, we are steadfast in our business development initiatives, and I'll talk about those in a few minutes. Our merchandise markets have upside potential in the automotive and metals markets. We expect growth in automotive as we continue to work through the backlog of shippable vehicles, improve our cycle times and grow our fleet size. We also still see unmet demand in our metals market, which we should realize as improving service should drive year-over-year growth. Offsetting anticipated growth in the fourth quarter will be sustained soft conditions in energy markets as the headwinds that pressured crude, NGL and sand volumes in the third quarter are expected to continue through the remainder of the year.\nAutomotive production is a key driver for many of our merchandise markets beyond automotive. So the duration and scope of the ongoing new AW strike is a downside risk to our overall merchandise volumes. Our marketing and operations teams are collaborating to deliver incremental business wins across the portfolio of carload markets that we serve by identifying and solving business challenges for our customers at an accelerating pace. This innovation and collaboration will be a driver of future growth for NS.\nIntermodal volume is expected to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter from sustained service recovery and improving market conditions. We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing in our domestic market. Our customers are seeing improvements in bid compliance and demand, which has us trending positively in October. While we continue to see a relatively muted peak season which will temper overall volumes. International markets will benefit from strong East Coast import demand and favorable ocean rates driving demand for IPI. We expect the negative mix effects from the shift back to short-haul lanes to persist in the fourth quarter, and we continue to experiment and develop new services for our Intermodal customers, and I'll talk about that in just a minute.\nCoal volumes should be stable in the fourth quarter with upside potential in export markets as new production comes online. In addition, recent trends in seaborne coal prices suggest higher prices throughout the remainder of the year due to supply constraints out of Australia as well as continued strong demand out of China and India. Domestic coal shipments should improve sequentially in the fourth quarter on improved service and fewer outages, but headwinds from low natural gas prices will continue to be a limiting factor.\nAnd while uncertainty in the economy continues to persist, we're confident in our ability to collaborate with our customers to drive incremental volume and to continue providing value in a manner that drives growth in the future.\nNow before I turn it back to Alan, I would like to expand briefly on how we're providing value in ways that drive growth in an unfavorable market.\nSlide 20 features key examples of new service offerings we developed this quarter aimed at making Norfolk Southern the preferred option for freight transportation and driving modal conversion. It's important to recognize that collaboration and teamwork invested by both Marketing and Operations to bring these projects to life.\nIn October, we partnered with CN to expand intermodal service and connect customers in Atlanta and Kansas City with markets on the CN in Canada. We also partnered with Florida East Coast Railway to expand both domestic and international intermodal services in Florida. These new services are designed to give our customers flexibility expand the reach of the NS Intermodal Network into key growth markets and give more ways for our customers to reduce their supply chain greenhouse gas emissions.\nEarly in September, we also announced an investment in DrayNow, a company focused on modernizing technology solutions for Intermodal. DrayNow is revolutionizing Intermodal's first and final mile journey through an app that provides customers with real-time shipment tracking and document capture of drayage shipments. Norwick Southern is the operator of the most extensive Intermodal network in the Eastern U.S. And together with DrayNow, and our best-in-class customers, we will drive more transparency into a fragmented supply chain and increase the ability to best serve our intermodal customers.\nAnd lastly, our persistent industrial development efforts paid off as both new and expanded industries turned on additional volume in the third quarter, including a new cement transload and ethanol terminal and a containerboard warehouse as well as expanded rail operations at an established grain elevator. We like to make our customers for locating on our network and allowing NS to serve their market needs.\nTogether, these diverse projects will generate over 7,800 new carloads annually at full production. We're aggressively pursuing project-oriented growth to enhance the NS network in a fragile freight environment. We're not sitting back and waiting for Carlos to come to us. But rather we are proactively making enhancements to our service portfolio to become a preferred service provider for our customers and drive sustainable and smart growth in the future.\nAnd concluding on Slide 21, let's look at our 2023 outlook. [indiscernible] Q3 revenue, which included significantly the lower fuel surcharge, we're now expecting 2023 revenue to be down closer to 4% year-over-year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring his home.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nClosing on Slide 22. Although this year has presented a number of challenges, we are emerging a stronger company due to our response and our decisive action to affect necessary improvements. I'm more confident than ever that our innovative strategy is a better way forward. We are already seeing the benefits from leadership changes, plan refinements and resource investments as we drive towards our strategy. We are achieving wins with our customer base, and we are incorporating operational discipline that drives consistency and enables productivity enhancements in the quarters ahead. I am extremely optimistic about our future.\nWe will now open the call to questions. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nLuke Nichols\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results.\nPlease refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures.\nTurning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our discussion of second quarter earnings. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. I would like to begin by thanking all of my colleagues at Norfolk Southern for their tremendous work this quarter. As you will hear this morning, we are delivering on our commitment to recover service quickly. We are delivering on our commitment to make a safe railroad even safer.\nWe are delivering on our commitment to address quality of life issues for our hardworking craft railroaders, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to make things right for the people of East Palestine and the surrounding communities. We have a vision for a better way forward for Norfolk Southern. Last December, we outlined a groundbreaking strategy that balances service, productivity and growth. It is designed to create long-term value for our customers, employees, shareholders and the communities we serve.\nOur commitment to that strategy was tested on February 3 with the derailment in East Palestine. Adversity reveals character and tests resolve. I'm proud of the way our team rose to the challenge. Our response in East Palestine has been fully aligned with our better way forward, making decisions in the best long-term interest of the community and surrounding areas has achieved significant progress. Our financial results were challenged this quarter as we noted in May that they would be. They reflect the decisive actions we have taken to advance our strategy and keep our promises in East Palestine. With every step forward, we are doing exactly what we said we would do when we announced our strategy last December.\nWe are investing in the long-term success of our company. With our strategy as our road map, we made significant progress in the second quarter, building the foundation for long-term value creation. This morning, I'll share a few notable examples of our progress. I'll start with service. In the first quarter, we expressed confidence that our service challenges were a temporary disruption due to deliberate management actions in response to the derailment and that our recovery plan would show results quickly.\nWe delivered. As Paul will describe shortly, service is now at levels comparable to our best performance in 2019. When we announced our strategy last year, I indicated that we will continue to make disciplined investments in our business through economic cycles. As Mark will describe, we are doing exactly what we said we would do. We continue to expand the ranks of our frontline craft railroaders, and we are investing in locomotives, intermodal infrastructure, new sidings, technology and other assets that will drive service, productivity and growth.\nWe are looking beyond this cycle to be ready to serve our customers and support their growth during the recovery and into the future. Another important way we moved our strategy forward in the second quarter was through our continuing progress engaging more effectively with our frontline railroaders. This is one of my top priorities as CEO, and it is a reason I spent so much time in the field. I've learned from every conversation with my [ craft ] colleagues. After the conclusion of our national labor negotiations last year, I promised to work with union leadership at the local level to address quality of life issues.\nWe kept that commitment, and I'm especially proud Norfolk Southern was the first Class 1 railroad to provide paid sick leave for all of our craft employees. We are building on that momentum. It was an extraordinary moment to co-author an open letter with the leaders of 12 railroad unions committing to collaborate on safety. And then a few days later, to share a stage with many of those same leaders in an all-employee town hall meeting to talk about safety and our strategy.\nOur people are excited to be part of a vision that focuses on growth. Our actions this quarter to advance our strategy extend well beyond operations. They run throughout our company. In marketing, we reorganized the team to align with our strategy, positioning us to maintain the deep customer relationships that characterize Norfolk Southern while simultaneously pursuing growth in high-value markets that make sense for our network. As part of that change, we made the innovative move this quarter to create the industry's first Vice President of First Mile Last Mile, building an entrepreneurial spirit and growth mindset into our organizational structure, continuous productivity improvement through cost management and smart revenue growth is a core element of our strategy.\nIn the second quarter, we created a new performance excellence team within operations, charged with building additional rigor and discipline into our processes. This work is foundational to our strategy. Standardizing our processes supports a high degree of [ planned ] compliance, which in turn gives us greater flexibility to innovate and test, targeted improvements that enhance consistent and reliable service and provide productivity opportunities, thus unlocking growth potential.\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress this quarter, strengthening our safety culture, implementing best practices and accelerating technology improvements. We look beyond the rail industry for a partner that would challenge and inspire us. We chose Atkins Nuclear Solutions, which brings experience from the Nuclear Navy, the gold standard of operational excellence and industrial safety. Then we reached out to the leaders of the national unions representing our frontline craft railroaders, and ask them to work with us to enhance rail safety.\nOur work is producing results. As Paul will describe in more detail, our safety metrics demonstrate significant improvement. As a result of these initiatives and more, Norfolk Southern today is a railroad poised for long-term value creation. We are implementing our innovative strategic plan and [indiscernible] to serve our customers and capture growth when demand inevitably returns.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Mark for a detailed look at our second quarter results.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning to everyone. Before we get into the operating results for the quarter, Slide 6 illustrates the financial impact from the Eastern Ohio derailment. There was another $416 million of costs recorded in Q2, primarily driven by environmental cleanup activities.\nOur estimates reflect the significant progress we've made remediating the site and the continued efforts we expect to undertake related to further restoration efforts. While our estimates reflect our expectation that activity at the site will meaningfully moderate in the fourth quarter, any changes in the nature, extent and duration of the remaining cleanup activities and government oversight activities may impact our current estimate. Additionally, developments with respect to the healthcare fund, which we are creating for affected residents as well as the potential fines, penalties or settlements and ongoing legal expenses will all likely impact our costs in future quarters.\nOf the $803 million recorded so far this year, only $287 million of the cash has been paid through June 30. We currently expect about half of our accrued balance to be paid over the remainder of the year with the rest in 2024 or later. Our 2023 results do not reflect potential recoveries from third parties or under our insurance coverage. Importantly, you will see in the quarter that we have started the process of pursuing recovery from third parties, a process we will continue to explore where appropriate in connection with our other lawsuits.\nAs for our insurance coverage, we expect to begin filing insurance claims here in the third quarter. This will be the first of many claims that will be made over the coming quarters. To remind everyone, we can only make claims upon payments being made not based on accruals. As you can imagine, insurance reimbursements and third-party recoveries will take time to materialize.\nTurning to Slide 7. Here, we illustrate the accounting impacts of the incident and response on our key metrics for Q2. At the bottom, you see the adjusted results excluding those impacts. Revenues were down 8% to last year, while adjusted operating expense was flattish. It's important to understand that the incident meaningfully harmed revenues in the quarter because of the resulting service disruption, but that impact is not adjusted from our GAAP figures and mitigating those service impacts cost us money to fix and those costs are also not accounted for in the $416 million operating expense adjustment.\nConsequently, the adjusted operating ratio was 66.7%. Had we been able to move a couple of hundred million more of revenue with our Q2 cost structure, our margins would have been much stronger. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 22%, net Income was down 18%, and EPS was down 14%.\nMoving to Slide 8. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Compensation and benefits were up $79 million or 13% in the quarter due to wage inflation and ongoing hiring to primarily shore up the remaining challenged locations on our network and in support of our strategic plan to build long-term network resiliency.\nMaterials and other expenses in the quarter were up $33 million or 19% driven primarily by a continuation of the locomotive related work we discussed during the first quarter call, bringing part of the [ stored ] fleet back into service to successfully accelerate the network, which you will hear more about from Paul.\nAdditionally, in other, the quarter was impacted by lower gains on the sale of property. Purchased services and rents were up $25 million or 5% this quarter as the challenge network created more headwinds to the category in addition to our continued investments in technology. Depreciation was up $17 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance.\nMitigating these increases were fuel expenses which were down $145 million or 36% in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let's look at the adjusted P&L results below the line. Partially mitigating the $279 million reduction in adjusted operating income was a $71 million increase in other income, driven by favorable investment returns and compares from company-owned life insurance. Net income and EPS were down 18% and 14%, respectively, in the quarter.\nMoving to free cash flow and shareholder returns on Slide 10. Through the first 6 months, free cash flow was lower by $276 million due to combined pressure from the derailment-related expenditures as well as investments in roadway and equipment. Shareholder distributions during the first half were $918 million, thanks to our solid dividend and share repurchase activity. I'll now turn it over to Paul for a discussion on our operations.\n\nPaul B. Duncan\n\nSVP Transportation & Network Operations, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our safety update on Slide 12. Everything starts with safety. We continue to make progress this year enhancing safety. Our injury frequency ratio is trending down 12% year-to-date versus last year. Our accident rates for the first half of the year is also down from prior years and our mainline train accident rate is trending improved 40% year-to-date versus last year.\nI want to take a moment to thank our leaders and our craft colleagues for collectively enhancing safety and driving these outcomes for our team, the communities we serve and our customers. We'll transition to our progress in safely delivering a reliable and resilient service product on Slide 13. You will recall during our last earnings call that we expected service to improve in summer and we have delivered on that promise. We've successfully restored our double-track mainline through East Palestine in a safe and environmentally appropriate way and we wasted no time resetting network performance levels our customers expect in this quarter between the Midwest and the Northeast.\nWe have significantly improved train velocity, dwell and service across our network to 2-year best resulting from these improvements. With service improved, our focus now is driving further reliability, productivity and resiliency in our network aligned with our strategic vision outlined in December.\nTouching on Slide 14. Now, what we told you would be an important measure of our service recovery reduction in cars online. Following the first quarter service interruptions, we had an inventory buildup. We set in place a plan to work down to build up as quickly as possible while also restoring our mainline and overall network conditions. We successfully executed on that plan and railcars are now cycling throughout our network faster than they have since before 2022, achieving greater railcar fleet productivity.\nTurning to Slide 15 for an update on our hiring progress. Our efforts to rightsize our [indiscernible] have continued the first half of this year. We are now at a point at which the training pipeline has crested and will begin to taper down over the back half of the year. We are committed to maintaining an appropriately-sized workforce to drive reliability and long-term resilience as part of our strategy.\nOur productivity metrics are shown on Slide 16. Our short-term service challenges described earlier contributed to productivity impacts as we work to restore service and velocity. Mark mentioned earlier that we return to serve as a portion of our road locomotive fleet to expedite our service recovery. With service and locomotive velocity much improved as we enter summer, we have now rightsized our road fleet and are now achieving velocity near 200 miles per day with our locomotives.\nAs part of our strategy to become not only reliable, but more resilient we have allocated a portion of our road locomotive fleet to surge capacity to be hot and ready to run at key locations of our network when needed. We continue to have a solid outlook for our locomotive fleet. Our DC to AC program is ongoing, which will provide us with a capacity dividend not only in terms of AC traction but also improvements in fuel efficiency.\nTransitioning to the workforce. T&E productivity was challenged due to the effort we put in place to accelerate the network, coupled with the contraction in volumes. Moving forward, we expect to improve T&E productivity through a variety of initiatives improving velocity, absorbing volume on existing trains and normalizing our CT pipeline.\nLastly, on fuel, we took a step back for the first time in 7 quarters. This was largely due to lower velocity and fewer GTMs on the network as we are restoring service. We are very confident that our initiatives that have been paying regular dividends will continue driving us towards further fuel efficiency as we continue to see the benefits of an improving network.\nMoving forward on Slide 17. Our focus will be on safely and productively delivering reliable and resilient service. Every conversation will start with safety as we continue to enhance it through the initiatives that we discussed. With service improved, our goal now is to continue to build further reliability and resiliency in the network but to do so productively. Velocity and service improvements will provide us further opportunities to leverage and spin our assets while pushing to drive further process standardization into our scheduled network to drive productivity.\nThis is the primary focus of our new performance excellence team, which was created this year. We will also continue to leverage the capital investments we have made to increase productivity, including recent [ siding projects ] between Chicago and Cincinnati that will allow us to increase train length and capacity in this quarter. Thank you, and I will now hand it off to Ed Elkins. .\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nVP of Industrial Products, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 19, I'll review our commercial results for the quarter. Now as we expected, the second quarter came with challenges related to ongoing soft freight demand, lower commodity prices and still recovering service levels. In total, we generated just under $3 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 8% from the second quarter of last year and that's driven by a 6% drop in volume and lower revenue from fuel and accessorials.\nARPU was also down year-over-year. However, revenue per unit less fuel improved 1% reflecting gains in price and favorable mix, and that's driven by tempered demand for intermodal and utility coal. I'd like to note here that underneath this favorable overall mix narrative, there was significant negative mix within markets that tempered overall revenue per unit performance, which I'll note below. Now merchandise results were varied as favorable conditions in the markets for automotive and agriculture products were offset by headwinds in chemicals markets. And that's a good example of the challenging RPU mix within markets that I just mentioned.\nAutomotive volumes were driven by robust finished vehicle production and agriculture shipments were strong due to new lane offerings and a weak local crop in the Southeast. Offsetting this growth was weakness in several of our chemical commodities as well as challenges to meet customer demand in key markets such as metals, aggregates and finished vehicles.\nTaken together, total merchandise volume and revenue for the second quarter came in 1% below prior year levels. Revenue per unit was flat year-over-year, but RPU less fuel grew 2%, which makes 32 out of the last 33 quarters that we've achieved growth in this metric. And I think that is a clear signal that our diverse portfolio and strong pricing discipline are delivering results.\nTurning to Intermodal. Continued market headwinds were felt the strongest in our domestic lines of business where volumes declined 14% year-over-year as weak freight demand, high inventories and excess truck capacity weighed on performance. Conversely, in a continuation of the first quarter trend, international volumes increased 1% year-over-year and 5.8% sequentially over last quarter.\nAs we guided to before, our customers have continued to shift highway freight back into [ IPI services ] and storage charges have declined as supply chain fluidity and container dwell have returned to pre-pandemic normalcy. As you would expect with this performance, Intermodal is another segment where ARPU mix with end markets was challenging for us. Both RPU and RPU less fuel were down significantly due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage charges.\nLastly, coal volume was flat year-over-year, but coal revenue fell 4% as RPU declined. Utility volumes were down 17% year-over-year due to historically low natural gas prices and elevated stockpiles. These declines were offset by gains in export shipments as a result of increased production and robust overseas demand. Although export volumes increased, the mix between [ export steam ] and export metallurgical coal shifted unfavorably and comparatively lower seaborne coal prices yielded lower revenue per unit.\nAgain, a key segment where ARPU mix within markets was a headwind. With that, let's turn to Slide 20 and review our outlook for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we're confident that our service product positions us to realize growth when market conditions improve. And as the year progresses, we are focused on pursuing the opportunities in markets that have the highest potential for growth for Norfolk Southern. We expect to increase our share in these markets as an improving service product and a sharply focused organization allows us to realize more of the ongoing demand for our services.\nBeginning with merchandise markets, conditions vary by individual market, and we see strong levels of nonresidential construction as reshoring and infrastructure projects increase which will drive strength in metals and construction volume. Pent-up demand for U.S. light vehicles will continue to support metals and automotive volumes. However, we expect continued weakness in our chemicals markets in the second half.\nTurning to Intermodal. We expect international volumes to continue its growth trend with an expected rebound in import volumes and the continued share growth of IPI. Storage charges will continue to be a revenue and RPU headwind compared to last year. On the domestic side, overall growth will be dependent on the U.S. consumer, retail inventory levels and the truck market.\nWe worked really hard with our best-in-class channel partners to sustain our service levels throughout the quarter during the crucial climax of bid season, and we're hearing from our key partners that our strategy is helping them increase their share of bid wins. We look forward to leveraging our capacity to realize this growth as market conditions improve.\nAnd finally, within our coal markets, we expect overall volume growth as continued strength in export markets more than offset weakness in utility coal. Coal production levels at NS-served mines will drive growth in export shipments, although we do expect lower seaborne coal prices to negatively impact RPU. The utility outlook is largely dependent on the weather, on existing stockpiles and natural gas prices. The net result is we expect total coal RPU to sequentially decline by a low double-digit percentage.\nDespite uncertainty across the economy, our focus on service, productivity and growth remains at the core of our strategy, and we're confident in our ability to grow our franchise and deliver value for our customers. On that note, I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 21, which highlights the strength of Norfolk Southern's network and our ability to drive growth both now and in the future.\nThe ecosystem for electric vehicles has been steadily developing in recent years as demonstrated by last quarter's announcement of the new Scout Motors plant on Norfolk Southern. We are focused on all facets of this emerging EV supply chain, including the EV battery and battery components.\nOver the last 18 months, more than $70 billion in new investment has been announced for building out EV battery manufacturing plants across North America. Our commercial team has worked to help locate nearly 1/3 of that investment on our network, including most recently in the second quarter, a new $3 billion General Motors and Samsung battery manufacturing plant in Indiana, on a Norfolk Southern main line. Norfolk Southern's network is well positioned for future industrial development.\nWe reached 60% of the U.S. population and cover 50% of our manufacturing base. We look forward to amplifying that strength through continued industrial development wins. Year-to-date, our industrial development team has reported $2.6 billion in industry investment that's been completed along Norfolk Southern lines, bringing 3,200 new jobs to the local communities that we serve. We continue to invest in site readiness for our highest potential industrial sites, and we're confident our diverse portfolio of shovel-ready sites combined with the strength of our network, we'll continue to land new opportunities across our network.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nChief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nThanks, Ed. Let's turn to Slide 22. As we have reached midpoint of 2023, I want to provide you with an update to our outlook. Although we entered the year expecting to achieve revenues comparable to 2022, the first half revenue shortfalls require us to modify our full year outlook. We now anticipate revenue to be down at least 3% in 2023 implying some modest volume improvements in the back half. We're also expecting modestly higher capital expenditures for the year as we accelerate investments in safety, service, productivity and growth. .\nFinally, I want to close our prepared remarks by reconfirming the commitment of the entire Norfolk Southern team to delivering long-term shareholder value through top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry competitive margins with balanced capital deployment. I'm confident that our strategy will help us achieve our full potential, and I'm encouraged by our progress and investments. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?"

Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results.\nPlease refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures.\nTurning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan Shaw\n\nEVP and Chief Marketing Officer, Norfolk Southern Corp\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. I will begin with an update on East Palestine and our ongoing focus on safe operations. From the beginning, we have been guided by one principle. We are going to do whatever it takes to make it right for East Palestine and the surrounding areas. We're cleaning the site safely, thoroughly and with urgency. We're assisting families, supporting local businesses and non-profits and investing in long-term projects for the area's future prosperity.\nI went to East Palestine in the immediate aftermath of the derailment and have returned almost every week to meet with members of the community and monitor our work.\nI've been in churches, schools, meeting halls, businesses and living rooms, asking how Norfolk Southern can use our resources to help the community recover and thrive. I'm proud of our people and our progress. I'm also proud of the crew and the locomotive that night.\nAccording to the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report, they were operating the train properly and took the right actions after receiving the alarm, the wayside detectors worked, and there were no track defects. As the NTSB continues its work, we have already begun to take actions designed to further enhance safety such as installing additional safety sensors, accelerating the deployment of advanced early detection technologies and increasing safety training for first responders.\nThe firefighters and other emergency responders who ran to the scene that night in East Palestine have our deepest gratitude and respect. They are heroes. We also appreciate the leadership of local state and federal officials and agencies in response to these events, we share their goals of helping people affected by the derailment and finding evidence-based approaches to rail safety. We are a safe railroad.\nIn 2022, Norfolk Southern had fewer derailments than any other year in the last 2 decades, and our rate of employee injuries was the lowest in a decade. We strive to do better. While events of the last few months have focused national attention on rail safety, the remits at Norfolk Southern in the first quarter declined from the same period last year, continuing a trend of improvement. We are going to learn from this accident to become an even safer company.\nI have been personally engaged in Washington to support specific federal legislative provisions to enhance safety. As the initial learnings from East Palestine have made clear, meaningful enhancements will require the combined efforts of the entire industry, railcar owners, leasing companies, equipment manufacturers and the railroad companies.\nNorfolk Southern intends to be a leader in that effort, and we embrace that role.\nTurning to Slide 4. At our Investor Day last December, we charted a new course for sustainable long-term value creation. We were the first railroad to launch a strategy that starts with safe, reliable and resilient service for our customers balanced with smart sustainable growth and productivity improvements.\nWith everything we do we will focus on long-term priorities and value rather than just the short term. I am reaffirming my commitment to that vision and building the team to drive that strategy. This new direction is even more important today, and we have been working to execute our industry-leading strategy.\nOur customer-centric operations-driven approach supports both service and safety and will enable us to grow with our customers sustainably for the long term. Our powerful network, desirable geographic footprint, best-in-class channel partners and strong relationships with our valued customers, uniquely position Norfolk Southern to deliver on our strategy. When we spoke in January service was the best in 2 years, customers were noticing and December volumes were at 52-week highs defined typical seasonality. Consistent with the long-term vision, after the East Palestine and Springfield derailments, we made 2 decisions. We knew would have a near-term impact on service, capacity and revenue.\nFirst, we are pulling up the tracks at the derailment site in East Palestine and removing the impact of soil in response to feedback from the community and the EPA. Since March 3, we have had only 1 track at a time in service with trains running at restricted speed through this section of our busiest quarter. This mainline segment links Chicago to Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, and there's a strength of our franchise.\nWe anticipate completing the remediation and having both tracks of service by early June.\nSecond, out of an abundance of caution, in early March, we accelerated the analysis of train makeup rules as part of our broader efforts to improve safety, service and productivity, which we began implementing soon thereafter. As a result of these purposeful actions on our part, train capacity was limited initially. Paul will address this in greater detail.\nWe are restoring capacity as we dial in this new set of processes. We do not anticipate any meaningful long-term impacts of service, capacity or cost structure. These were the right things to do. They are also the best decisions to enhance our ability to deliver on our long-term strategy of delivering resilient service. It will take some time to build resiliency and we're making progress.\nWe continue to invest to ensure we have the right team and resources where they are needed to provide our customers with safe best-in-class service. As we shared when we announced our new strategy last December, we aren't focused on managing short-term OR with actions that will undermine our longer-term goals. We strive for more.\nOur longer-term commitment to competitive margins will be balanced with other important financial measures such as growth in revenue, EPS and ROIC.\nPutting that plan into action, we are making strategic investments in the near term that position us to deliver long-term value. One of those investments is to maintain the people and resources we need through economic downturns. This will allow us to respond more quickly and capture revenue growth when markets recover. Even more significant, resilient service enables our customers to confidently build rail into their supply chains and supports highway to rail conversions. We will use temporary downturns to invest in training, creating career opportunities for the craft railroaders who are the heart and soul of Norfolk Southern.\nI enjoy the time I spend in crew rooms and have made it my personal goal to listen to my craft colleagues about what they need. I won't stop working until our service and safety culture is the acknowledged model for the industry.\nOur strategy is a better way forward for the industry. It's a better way to deliver value to shareholders, and it's the right thing to do for our employees, our customers and the communities we serve.\nBefore I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment and recognize our customers who have shown a tremendous amount of support throughout the challenges of the first quarter. I received countless calls, letters and e-mails from customers recognizing Norfolk Southern's positive response and dedication to making it right. It's made me proud to be part of the Norfolk Southern team and truly demonstrates the deep partnerships we have forged with our customers.\nI'll now turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark George\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. On Page 6, you will see our key financial results for the quarter. The top row represents the GAAP measures. On the second row are the current cost estimates and impacts related to the Eastern Ohio incident and response. On the third row, you see the adjusted results.\nThe $387 million of expense that we recorded for the incident includes costs associated with the cleanup of the site, community support and restoration payments, legal and advisory expenses and a preliminary estimate of claims and settlements. It is important to note that no insurance or other recoveries are assumed in these estimates and that credits associated with these recoveries will be determined and recorded in future periods.\nSimilarly, as we learn more, one can expect future estimates of cost will result in revisions to the accruals in subsequent quarters. The 2 rows at the bottom reflect the variances versus Q1 of 2022. GAAP earnings were down year-over-year due to the Eastern Ohio cost that were recorded.\nThe adjusted variances at the bottom reflects 7% revenue growth that Ed will detail shortly, along with adjusted net income growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Adjusted operating expense were up 11% in the quarter, and Slide 7 details the drivers, which I will walk through now.\nAdjusted operating expenses were up $204 million or 11%, with the majority of the increase being driven by inflation and incremental service-related costs. Inflationary pressures are visible in pretty much all P&L categories, most notably in comp and ben from last year's wage settlements. In comp and ben, we also saw an increase in headcount as we continue to build our T&E resources to help us become more reliable and resilient in support of our long-term strategy for growth.\nPurchase service growth is also impacted by inflation, but is also driven in part by technology investments, including projects aimed at improving productivity, operational executability and enhanced safety. The service disruptions triggered by the Eastern Ohio derailment, the associated shutdown of our main line in a critical corridor as well as the acceleration of our enhanced train makeup rules is having an incremental impact on costs, resulting in slower network speeds that inflates equipment rents while also driving a meaningful increase in material costs, in part because we strategically work to bring locomotives into service from our stored fleet to help accelerate our network.\nMoving to depreciation, please recall that we gave guidance on depreciation headwind this year from a recently completed roadway depreciation study, and that contributed $8 million of headwind in the quarter, and that will continue as a headwind in subsequent quarters. We also drove fuel efficiency by another 1% improvement in the quarter versus last year.\nMoving to the P&L results below operating income on Slide 8 and I'll talk to the adjusted variances here in the right-hand columns. Operating income grew 1%. Other income was $56 million, aided by favorable returns on company-owned life insurance and that helped adjusted pretax income grow 7%. Net income grew 8% and EPS grew 13% in the quarter.\nTurning to free cash flow and shareholder distributions on Slide 9. Cash from operations was $179 million higher, in part from changes in working capital, while free cash flow was $140 million higher than last year, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders with a strong dividend, supplemented by share repurchases.\nLet me turn now to Paul for his review on operations.\n\nPaul Duncan\n\nThank you, Mark. I'll begin on Slide 11. On my first earnings call as Chief Operating Officer this January, I shared my intention to begin every update with safety. This reflects the priority we put on the topic. Everything we do starts with safety. At the time, my leadership team and I were in the middle of kickoff meetings with operations leaders across our network. Alan joined us for some of those meetings. Our marketing leadership team participated in others.\nWe started every meeting with safety discussing that it is an enterprise priority. We are investing in our leadership this year with all of our ballast line supervisors in starting every conversation with safety. As leaders, we set the tone and tone influences culture.\nWe are also investing in the development of community responders, including a new regional training facility in Bellevue, Ohio. We are a safe railroad and constantly challenge ourselves to do even better.\nWe will continue to work with our employees and community partners on safety-related initiatives that further enhance our culture in these areas. I'll note specific steps we are taking to enhance safety after reviewing the NTSB's preliminary report on the East Palestine derailment, including adding 200 more hot bearing detectors onto our network expanding our network of acoustic bearing detectors and accelerating the deployment of digital train inspection portals, our most advanced safety technology, which we described in greater detail during our Investor Day.\nOn Slide 12, you will see our safety metrics. As Alan noted, in 2022, Norfolk Southern had the lowest rate of employee injuries in a decade with a 1.01 frequency ratio. We began 2023 with a 0.89 injury frequency ratio and continue to work so all of our colleagues go home to their families in the same condition they arrive. We are also making strides to reduce our FRA accident rate. We are showing one additional graph this quarter, reflecting the frequency of accidents that occur on mainline tracks.\nWhile we strive to reduce all accidents, mainline accidents tend to have greater impact to the communities that we serve. These have generally been flat with year-over-year improvement through Q1 compared to Q1 2022. Our investment in infrastructure is paying off, and we're confident our focus on equipment inspection technology will continue to drive our mainline accident rate lower.\nTurning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our overall service. In the first quarter, we accelerated the analysis of train makeup rules as part of our broader efforts to improve safety, service and productivity. We began implementing enhancements soon thereafter, resulting in a significant short-term impact on velocity and the performance of our railroad. However, these changes were the right thing to do and have increased the reliability of our network and also allowed us to become even more productive. For example, we are now operating 50% more merchandise trains with distributed power than this same time last year. This was only possible thanks to our continuing commitment to locomotive modernization, another example of how we are investing in long-term value.\nAs Alan explained, we also made the decision to pull up the 2 mainline tracks at the derailment site and remove all impacted soil. From March 3, until the remediation is complete, currently expected in early June, we are only operating one track at reduced speed through that section of our busy Premier Corridor. We have everything we need to recover from this temporary setback to our momentum. Remember that prior to the derailment, our service was the best it had been in 2 years. As we dial in our train makeup enhancements, we are already seeing improvements to our network in recent weeks.\nWe will continue to work through the backlog and do not expect any meaningful long-term impacts. We are eager to get back to the execution of our service-oriented strategy.\nTransitioning to Slide 14. As we invest in the people and resources we need to execute our strategy and become more resilient, we still have about 1/3 of our high-end locations below our minimum staffing target based on anticipated demand. We continue to hire at a strong pace and have a robust pipeline of trainees in place. We are employing incentives to attract candidates in targeted locations, and we are taking a series of steps to provide immediate support where it is needed. For example, we are leveraging our go teams and temporary transfers in critical areas as we continue to restore the network.\nMoving to Slide 15 for our productivity update. Starting with locomotives, we maintained progress in the quarter on keeping locomotive velocity well above last year's levels. The overall Train & Engine workforce productivity metric remains below last year due to the elevated pipeline of conductor trainees as well as maintaining capacity in support of service and future growth.\nAs we have discussed, an essential aspect of our balanced strategy for service, productivity and growth is to provide resilient service through economic downturns and times of volume uncertainty. This represents a deliberate strategic investment to maintain capacity in support of service and future growth.\nLastly, our modernized locomotive fleet and fuel efficiency initiatives produced another quarter of record fuel productivity. This is another area where we will continue to invest to drive benefits for our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.\nI'll now turn it over to Ed Elkins.\n\nEd Elkins\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm starting on Slide 17, where our results for the quarter speak to the benefits of our diverse portfolio in that we were able to de-leverage strong market conditions in our merchandise and coal markets to offset weaker conditions in our intermodal markets. This enabled year-over-year growth in revenue and revenue per unit in the first quarter.\nAs you can see, overall volume was flat, but total revenue increased 7% to $3.1 billion due to higher fuel surcharges and positive mix, which more than offset lower volume in storage revenue in intermodal. Volume and revenue were strongest in January when our service product was the best it has been in 2 years, and the truck market was showing signs of rebalancing. Volume and revenue decelerated throughout the quarter as service disruptions impacted our ability to meet customer demand in key markets and the truck market continued to deteriorate.\nOur performance in January demonstrates that a customer-centric operations-driven approach can yield significant value for our customers and our shareholders. Within merchandise, volume growth of 5% was led by strength in sand, automotive, grain and aggregates markets. These gains were partially offset by weakness in demand for plastics and for pulp board. Volume improvement was the largest driver of double-digit revenue growth in merchandise this quarter, followed by higher fuel prices and price gains.\nIntermodal markets were notably weaker this quarter, particularly within our domestic lines of business where a weak freight environment and a weakening truck sector combined to drive a 4% volume decline year-over-year. International intermodal was a bright spot this quarter with volumes improving 9% year-over-year on higher demand for IPI services, even as overall imports fell, which helped to mitigate some of the domestic declines.\nIntermodal revenue benefited from higher fuel surcharges and price this quarter However, not enough to overcome the negative impacts of lower storage revenue and lower domestic volume, which drove a 5% decline in revenue versus the prior period.\nNow I'd note that the combination of improving international IPI volumes and declining intermodal storage revenue is a strong indication that supply chain congestion is rapidly unwinding in the U.S.\nCoal shipments in the first quarter were up 5% year-over-year, led by export, which is currently experiencing continued high levels of demand as well as greater coal supply in our service territory to meet that demand. Volume growth was muted somewhat by year-over-year declines in utility coal due to depressed natural gas prices and mild winter weather.\nCoal revenue was up 13% in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes, fuel surcharge and price gains.\nNow moving to Slide 18. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2023, we expect near-term headwinds to pressure volume and revenue throughout the second quarter. However, we are optimistic that our service product will be much improved in the back half of the year, positioning us to return to growth when market conditions permit.\nAdditionally, we are walking on to the field today with the best marketing team in the business. And this team is working hard to identify new avenues to growth in the form of new markets to serve and new products to deliver. Even in a decelerating economy, we know that we can offer exceptional value to customers seeking to reduce their overall spend on transportation and reduce their carbon footprint. As we look at the rest of the year, Merchandise growth will be led by automotive shipments, supported by the forecasted 5% growth in U.S. light vehicle production for the remaining quarters of 2023. Also contributing to growth in automotive shipments is a backlog of shippable ground counts that we will work through as our service improves.\nWe also expect strong volume improvement in our metals market where improved equipment cycle times will enable us to serve unmet demand. Partially offsetting expected growth will be weakness in our chemicals markets where certain segments, like plastics, are experiencing weaker demand.\nFacility downtime and increased pipeline capacity will also drive year-over-year declines in shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Within our intermodal markets, volume in 2023 will be largely dependent on economic conditions, particularly the health of the American consumer. Currently, we see headwinds from excess truck capacity replenished inventories and a challenging consumer economy, and these headwinds are likely to persist throughout the second quarter, negatively impacting volume, particularly in our domestic lines of business.\nLooking at the back half of '23, clearly, the economic conditions remain uncertain. We see continued weakness in the housing market, which negatively impacts demand for furniture, home appliances, electronics, all those things that want to move in a container. That market has not rebalanced as we anticipated earlier this year, with spot and contract truck rates continuing to fall throughout the first quarter.\nSo the timing of the rebalancing will have a large impact on our volume outlook. Additionally, our domestic partners outlook for the second half of '23 has dimmed somewhat. International intermodal shipments will be driven by demand for IPI, which is a function of import volumes, which is declining and supply chain fluidity, which is improving.\nFluidity has returned to supply chains faster than we expected, which will be a tailwind to volumes, but will negatively impact intermodal storage revenue for the remainder of this year. Taken together, we are optimistic for our intermodal business to overcome these near-term challenges and to finish the year with momentum to realize the long-term potential of this market.\nWe have the best intermodal partners in the industry. And our team is working hard to ensure that we are positioned for success with them as the market turns.\nLastly, volume in our coal business for the remainder of '23 will be up versus '22 with growth in export coal shipments more than offsetting expected declines in utility coal. Strength in export coal markets will be driven by new coal production coming online at NS-served mines and sustained international demand for U.S. sourced coal. However, the expected increase in volume will be more than offset by anticipated lower revenue per unit due to lower seaborne coal prices and reduced fuel surcharge revenue.\nThe utility outlook is highly dependent upon weather and natural gas pricing, which is currently expected to average less than $3 per million BTU in '23, a more than 50% decrease from last year.\nIn addition, stockpiles are currently at increased levels, which further pressures demand for utility coal shipments. Overall, we have a cautious outlook for the remainder of '23. Improving service levels will be a tailwind, but persistent market headwinds and a stubbornly loose truck market will temper our ability to grow in the near term.\nOverall, growth in 2023 will be dependent on the macro environment. We continue to put our efforts on things that we can control to deliver on our customer-centric operations-driven strategy. We are making the investments required to deliver compelling logistics value for the long-term through a simple, reliable and efficient customer experience.\nLastly, on Slide 19, I'd like to highlight a recent industrial development success that demonstrates the long-term value of locating along Norfolk Southern lines. Scout Motors, an independent U.S. company backed by Volkswagen Group is locating a new manufacturing plant in Blythewood, South Carolina and a site served by Norfolk Southern. In Phase 1, this new plant will produce more than 200,000 new electric vehicles and create over 4,000 permanent jobs. The $2 billion investment by Scout will revive an iconic brand that last produced vehicles in 1980, and we couldn't be happier that Scout selected a site served by Norfolk Southern. We look forward to serving their business by the end of 2026.\nBefore I close, I'd like to say thank you to our customers who have supported us through the challenges of this first quarter. We appreciate every opportunity that they give us to participate in their supply chains, and we look forward to successfully growing these partnerships. We are confident in our ability to realize long-term growth and we look forward to delivering results for our customers and for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home.\n\nAlan Shaw\n\nEVP and Chief Marketing Officer, Norfolk Southern Corp\n\nThanks, Ed. This week marks the end of my first year as CEO. As I reflect on the year more broadly and especially the last few months, I appreciate that adversity reveals character. That's true for people, and it's true for organizations. I'm inspired by my colleagues at Norfolk Southern, who are rising to the challenge of doing the right thing.\nWe are anchored by our values and driven by our responsibility to safely deliver the goods and materials that move the U.S. economy.\nMoving forward, Norfolk Southern will be known for safe operations and for delivering service, productivity and growth through our pioneering new strategy. Our response in East Palestine will be a source of pride for years to come, and we will be a stronger company, setting the pace for our industry. Whether it's our commitment to the citizens of East Palestine, our employees, our customers are to all the communities in which we operate every day. When we do the next right thing, we deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Nichols, you may begin.\n\nLuke Nichols\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer. I'm also pleased to welcome Paul Duncan, who moved into the role of Chief Operating Officer on January 1. At our Investor Day last month, we shared our strategy to create long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach of reliable and resilient service, continuous productivity improvement and smart and sustainable growth. At the heart of that strategy is a service product that allows us to compete in that $860 billion truck and logistics market and gives our customers the confidence to build Norfolk Southern into their supply chain.\nI was at the Midwest Association of Rail shippers winter meeting last week, talking with customers about our new strategy. And the reactions were extremely positive. Now our job is to prove it consistently. With performance, we made great strides to close the year and are encouraged by our progress. We will continue to refine and evolve to provide a service product to market values. Service is at the best it's been in more than 2 years, and customers are noticing.\nVolumes in December were at 52-week highs, outperforming typical seasonality as Ed and Paul's teams work collaboratively with our customers to attract business to Norfolk Southern, overcoming headwinds associated with a slower network in the first 3 quarters that constricted our capacity.\nOur team persevered, adapted and achieved strong results in a challenging year. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, we were able to achieve double-digit growth in both revenue and EPS. We established new records for full year revenue, operating income, and other metrics that the team will detail later this morning.\nAlso this quarter, we finalized national contracts with the unions representing our craft colleagues. These agreements recognize the hard work and dedication of our frontline railroaders with historic wage increases in an unparalleled health and welfare benefits package.\nWith national bargaining now complete, we started discussions at the local level to address important quality of life issues. I would like to thank the entire Norfolk Southern team for their incredible effort during the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2022.\nI'm proud of the improvement our team has delivered and the momentum we have created. Our relentless focus on service continues in 2023. You'll hear more from Paul momentarily about how our across-the-board improvement is now allowing us to target specific opportunities for service and productivity enhancements.\nWe recognize that the macroeconomic environment in which we operate is uncertain, and you'll hear more about the impact of that from Ed and Mark.\nLonger term, we are building on the momentum we carry into 2023. And of course, we've charted in our new strategy.\nAs you heard at our Investor Day, we believe Norfolk Southern is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value through top-tier revenue and earnings growth, industry competitive margins and balanced capital deployment. We will get there by being a customer-centric operations-driven service organization, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you.\nNow, I'll turn it over to Paul for more detail on the improved service we are providing to our customers. Paul?\n\nPaul B. Duncan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning. I am excited to be leading the operating team as we implement the vision set forth this last quarter. My focus since assuming the role of Chief Operating Officer has been in 2 areas: collaborating with marketing and our customers to convert improved service into increased volume on the network; and getting out to talk with our field leaders about our new strategy to be a customer-centric operations-driven organization.\nThe team has tremendous pride in Norfolk Southern and the feedback we are hearing is overwhelmingly positive. When we talk about growth, our people hear stability and opportunity. One 40-year Norfolk Southern veteran in Birmingham told me last week, he has never been more optimistic about the direction and culture of the company.\nI'll begin with a safety discussion on Slide 5. Our injury frequency rate improved 22%. Every conversation will begin with safety in 2023 and beyond. Operating safely is the right thing for our employees, customers, shareholders and the communities that we serve. This is an area where we have made great strides, but even one serious incident is too many.\nThank you to those closest to the [ballast] line for the gains we achieved in safety in 2022 and for the efforts we will all make safely delivering in 2023.\nMoving to Slide 6. Since we spoke last at our Investor Day, our service is the best it has been in more than 2 years. Our leadership, the implementation of our simpler, more executable operating plan TOP|SPG and our continued resource adds have contributed to significant improvements in service for all of our customers.\nFor premium Intermodal, we safely delivered a perfect peak season for our largest parcel customer. Domestic intermodal performance has improved. Average container transit times have been reduced by 12 hours between Chicago and the Northeast, our largest corridor, with consistency also now meeting expectations. Merchandise performance is consistent, and this is another segment where our improved velocity is creating capacity.\nBoth trains are cycling at historic best transit turn times, maximizing our asset utilization across commodities. You'll note that train speed has continued to climb from our low point last year with terminal dwell also creating capacity for growth. Our service product has turned the corner, and we are focused on building further reliability and resiliency into our network that our customers expect moving forward.\nMoving to our productivity update on Slide 7. We are committed to our balanced approach to service, productivity and growth. Let's start with locomotives. We have made solid progress on getting more productive use out of our fleet. You can see that here in terms of increasing our locomotive miles per day.\nAt Investor Day, I referenced the flywheel effect that speeding up the network will produce. This is the start of that flywheel, which produced a 6% improvement last quarter and has improved 12% so far in January. Getting our locomotives moving more efficiently ensures we are creating capacity for growth. Next, we have grown our workforce, and that has been a critical element to our service improvement. Our GTMs were flat versus last year while our training pipeline has remained above steady state levels, pressuring workforce productivity. This is a good news story looking forward as we are building the capacity we need to be reliable and resilient with the gains in service that we have made. We will build upon this foundation to drive greater workforce productivity as we bring volume back on the railroad.\nLastly, we have set another quarterly record for fuel efficiency. Our increasing fluidity certainly has played a role alongside our portfolio of fuel efficiency initiatives including our fleet modernizations and idling compliance initiatives. Improving productivity is key to our balanced plan, and we are going to continue driving sustainable efficiency gains to provide value for our shareholders and our customers.\nOn Slide 8, I will recap the industry-leading progress that we have made on hiring in 2022 and talk about what we see ahead. We entered the year in the very early stages of priming the conductor training pipeline and ramped up in record time, which was no easy task given the tightness in the labor market. We increased training wages, drove efficiencies into our onboarding process, jump started a grassroots campaign leveraging referral incentives and more. These efforts have paid off with much of our network reaching the minimum staffing levels determined by our data-driven approach. We are now focused on shoring up the remaining crew bases that are short, and we are determined to do so in 2023.\nAs we make progress, we are deploying go teams more effectively and are executing the resiliency vision laid out at Investor Day by cross-qualifying crews and expanding training efforts.\nMoving to Slide 9. I will cover a few items that we are working on as we enter the New Year. First, let's talk about the culture of continuous improvement we are building. We have greatly improved service and to bring our vision of long-term service resilience to reality. We know we have to keep getting better.\nLet me provide a few examples. With Intermodal, we are using the initial rollout and learnings from our high-frequency operating plan discussed at Investor Day, along with our perfect peak season to improve capacity and reliability across our Intermodal franchise.\nOn the Merchandise side, we are applying continuous improvement principles, identifying and implementing those next levers that will drive even greater resiliency and resource productivity to move cars faster and more consistently. We are building tools as part of our digital transformation to provide more actionable and timely information to a more empowered workforce.\nThese are just a few examples of how we are driving continuous improvement into our DNA.\nNext, we are slated to modernize another 115 locomotives this year, converting them from DC to AC traction technology and giving them a full rejuvenation. These 115 rebuilds will reduce locomotive hauling capability equivalent to 150 DC locomotives, providing additional capacity for growth with fewer assets. Our DC to AC conversions will continue to provide even greater fuel efficiency and added pulling power to increase train productivity further.\nOur DC to AC conversion strategy will provide further opportunities to grow train size and increase train productivity, which we discussed at Investor Day. We have made marked progress on this long-term initiative. And just this month, we increased train size 53% in 1 of our 2 highest volume export [coal lanes] which will provide greater capacity and resiliency in our customer supply chain.\nNext up, let's talk about our capital investments. Our best-in-class engineering team safely delivered a productive year with more than 520 track miles of rail replaced, the most NS has done in 3 decades. We installed 10% more ties in 2022 than in 2021 with the same level of production teams and our servicing teams worked 27% more track than in 2021.\nWe are committed to safely building and maintaining a reliable and resilient infrastructure for our customers productively. We're primed to execute on our capital plan in support of safety, resiliency, growth and productivity. This will include a longer siding between Cincinnati and Fort Wayne, which will incorporate additional resilience into our train network. This is just one of the efforts we will highlight as the year progresses. Lastly, we were intensely focused on converting the capacity gains that we have made with TOP|SPG and our disciplined execution of the plan into additional volume moving over the railroad in 2023. Our Intermodal, Merchandise and bulk service are all now consistently performing at high levels of service across our network.\nI will now hand it to Ed to expand on the market outlook and talk about how we can put this capacity to work. Thank you.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nExecutive VP & CMO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Paul. It's great to have you with us, and good morning to everyone. Let's review our results for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 11. Overall, revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, with higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price improvements more than offsetting a 1% decline in volume. The pricing environment remains strong and we capitalize by delivering our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year RPU less fuel growth in intermodal and our 30th out of 31 quarters in merchandise.\nSpeaking of Merchandise, volumes recovered to prior year levels as service improved in the fourth quarter, enhancing our ability to drive value for our customers. Our largest gains were in the sand and proppants market to support the recent surge in demand for natural gas production followed by corn and soybeans also driven by exceptionally high demand. We saw declines in our steel and automotive markets where equipment availability was particularly challenged.\nAs Paul highlighted earlier, we are making meaningful progress on improving car velocity in our merchandise fleets, and we started to see the results of that increased velocity towards the end of the quarter. Merchandise revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, reached a record level from price gains and positive mix.\nShifting to Intermodal. Total revenue improved 10% year-over-year as higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains more than offset a 4% decline in volume. The volume decline was concentrated within our domestic lines of business where headwinds from a loosening truck market and higher inventories heading into the holiday season negatively impacted demand. Conversely, our international lines of business grew in the fourth quarter. Our international intermodal volume rose 5% year-over-year as several of our customers shifted back to Inland Point Intermodal services amid lower ocean rates and easing supply chain congestion.\nTotal intermodal revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, were up year-over-year on higher fuel revenue and price gains.\nIf we turn to coal, our results for the quarter reflect both our success in capturing upside revenue potential from the market dynamics as well as our ability to create capacity for growth through improved service.\nCoal revenue for the quarter increased 28%, driven by price gains, volume growth, higher revenue from fuel surcharge and liquidated damages from prior volume shortfalls. Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, reached record levels, reflecting the value of our market-based pricing approach in these volatile energy markets. We were able to leverage increased equipment availability from improved cycle times to capture more utility coal business, which led to a 9% volume gain in utility coal in the fourth quarter.\nOur export coal markets also grew due to higher demand driven by geopolitical conflict. Overall, coal volumes increased 8% in the quarter, and this volume growth was partially offset by year-over-year declines in coke shipments resulting from facility closures.\nLet's move to Slide 12 for the full year of 2022. Total revenue for the year reached $12.7 billion, a 14% increase from 2021 driven by higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains, partially offset by volume declines. We delivered record level total revenue and revenue less fuel, revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel, despite a 3% decline in total volume. Volume headwinds were strongest in our intermodal franchise, where a weakening truck market and supply chain congestion led to declines in annual volume.\nWe saw growth in our coal business as a strong export market and a strong global market for energy increased volumes for coal on NS. Our performance as the year progressed into 2022 provides evidence that our recovering service product is providing momentum to the commercial side of our business. We're working together internally to enhance our offerings in the marketplace and to ensure that we are delivering the value our customers need to be successful.\nLastly, if you will join me on Slide 13, our outlook for 2023 is cautiously optimistic amid uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and some signals of a slowdown in activity. Our improving service levels will drive opportunities for modal conversion from truck and increase our capacity to address unmet demand. At the same time, economic conditions could be a headwind to volume at least in the near term, while lower fuel prices and accessorial revenues will temper our revenue per unit.\nWithin Merchandise, we anticipate that macroeconomic conditions will pressure a variety of the markets that we participate in. We're mindful of recent weakness in industrial production, particularly with respect to manufacturing, and that drives many of our markets. Current forecast for manufacturing in the U.S. shows contraction in 2023 as businesses rightsize inventories to demand.\nAdditionally, the weak housing market will be a headwind to many of our industrial businesses and we expect this weakness to persist in 2023 as the housing market adjusts to higher interest rates. Volumes will also be supported by increased equipment availability and overall network fluidity.\nLooking at Intermodal, volume growth will be dependent on the macroeconomic environment, although our improving service levels will create capacity for growth. Total revenue will be pressured by lower fuel surcharges and reduced storage revenue as supply chains continue to normalize throughout the year. Household balance sheets are supported by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and credit remains available for many despite becoming more expensive.\nAnd so long as the U.S. consumer remains resilient, we would expect supportive demand for Intermodal. Weakness in the truck market at the start of the year, along with housing will be a headwind but we anticipate the truck market to rebalance supply and demand later this year.\nOur international business will continue to benefit from lower ocean rates and improving supply chain fluidity at Inland Points, prompting a return of our customers to Inland Point Intermodal.\nTurning to coal. The current outlook for the utility and export coal markets supports a flat to modest year-over-year volume improvement. While overall utility demand is likely to remain flat, our capacity to handle more of that demand will increase with efficiency and productivity improvements on our network. For export, Norfolk Southern will benefit from additional coal supply coming online despite softening seaborne prices. We expect the global supply of met coal to continue to be restricted by geopolitical factors which should support demand for U.S.-sourced coal. We will experience tough coal pricing comps in the first half of the year, which will pressure export met RPUs on a year-over-year basis.\nOverall, we are energized by our recent momentum heading into '23, and we are focused on leveraging that momentum to drive value for our customers and grow our business. Uncertainty and downside risks are certainly still present, but we're going to continue to focus on the things that we can control to successfully execute our strategic plan and deliver results for our customers and for our shareholders.\nAnd lastly, I'd like once again to recognize our customers for their partnership throughout 2022 and thank them for their business. We appreciate all of their support as we move forward in 2023 with sustained momentum towards delivering the service product that they need to succeed.\nI will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 15. As you heard from Ed, we had another quarter of strong revenue performance, up 13%. Operating expenses in the quarter were up $333 million or 19% year-on-year, driven primarily by elevated fuel prices and some significant adverse accrual adjustments that I will describe shortly which had an outsized impact on the operating ratio.\nOperating income at $1.18 billion set a fourth quarter record. EPS was $3.42, up double digits year-over-year.\nMoving to Slide 16. Let's reconcile the drivers of the changes in operating income, operating ratio and earnings per share. Talking specifically to operating income, the $52 million improvement was aided by the first row in the bottom section, a favorable wage accrual true-up related to our commitment to getting retroactive wages distributed to our employees before the end of the year. It was not only the right thing to do, but the acceleration created the added benefit of saving payroll taxes for employees as well as for the company.\nThat adjustment provided a $16 million expense savings, which equates to 50 basis point tailwind to the OR and a [nickel boost to EPS.] But in the second row of the reconciliation at the bottom, you will see that there was a $57 million expense headwind from numerous unexpected adverse items in the claims category that I'll put in 3 buckets.\nAccrual adjustments related to personal injury reserves based on actuarial studies, adjustments to environmental reserves based on activity and costs associated with derailments that occurred during the quarter. Combined, these adverse items versus a smaller positive adjustment last Q4 result in $57 million of year-over-year headwind in the fourth quarter, which equates to 180 basis points OR drag and $0.19 of EPS.\nAbsent those 2 reconciling items I just detailed, core operating income growth was actually $93 million and that translates to EPS growth of $0.44. The OR contraction at 180 basis points reflects lower incrementals driven by the net inflation impact as well as service-related costs.\nSo let's drill into the operating expenses for the quarter now on Slide 17. Fuel was again a primary expense driver this quarter, up $141 million or 62% due to elevated fuel prices. Materials & Other was up $78 million, which included the $71 million increase in claims that was heavily impacted by the items we just discussed. Compensation and benefits were up $55 million or 9%, driven by elevated wages from the new labor contracts as well as higher employment levels.\nPurchased services were up $48 million or 10% in the quarter, driven primarily from continued inflationary pressures, costs related to our service environment as well as technology-related costs as we progress our digital transformation. Some of the inflation impacts are associated with intermodal operations that more than offset savings from lower intermodal volumes.\nDepreciation was up $11 million year-over-year, consistent with prior quarters. But let me point out that we are nearing completion of our periodic roadway depreciation study and the findings will result in a quarterly step-up in our 2023 depreciation expense. You can expect in 2023 that the quarterly year-over-year growth will be around double what you see here, meaning that the full year impact will be a step-up in the $40 million to $50 million range.\nShifting to Slide 18. Let's look at the results below the line. After spending much of the year as a net expense, other income flipped back to a more normal profile and amounted to $34 million, an increase of $13 million over last year. Net income in the quarter was up $30 million or 4%. EPS growth at 10% exceeded the net income growth due to strong share repurchase activity.\nTurning now to Slide 19 and looking at the full year results. EPS was $13.88, an increase of $1.77 or 15% relative to 2021, driven by record revenues of $12.7 billion, which was up 14% compared to 2021. As you look at the full year OpEx and operating ratio headwinds versus prior year, recall the adverse impact of the wage settlement.\nMoving to Slide 20. Property additions at $1.9 billion ended the year exactly as we had been guiding. We had another strong year for shareholder distributions with over $4 billion returned again in 2022, with over 12.6 million shares repurchased. Dividend distributions were up 14%, and you will have read about our Board just approving a 9% or $0.11 increase to our quarterly dividend here in the first quarter. All this demonstrates our commitment to return capital to shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn it back over to Alan.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark. Let's turn to Slide 21. Our outlook for 2023 reflects the uncertainty of a challenging macro landscape in which the path of the demand environment and inflation are unclear. At this time, we see full year revenue level with 2022 performance. We expect to be able to absorb volume pressure with share recapture. Thanks to our improving service product. RPU will be down to flat as we deal with pressure from softening coal pricing, lower fuel surcharge revenue and the eventual unwinding of accessorial revenues as supply chains unlock.\nRPU will benefit from another strong year in core pricing gains. There are a lot of variables that are hard to predict in this uncertain environment. But in a flat revenue environment, it will be difficult to grow operating income in 2023. With the cost benefits from an improving service product being more than neutralized by inflation as well as the RPU headwinds I just described. As you heard from Mark at Investor Day, we're expecting CapEx to be roughly $2.1 billion for 2023. This is consistent with and supportive of the balanced and disciplined spending plan that Mark detailed in December. Despite the uncertainty, we entered 2023 with great confidence and momentum. When we look ahead, we see more than cyclical economic challenges in front of us.\nWe see long-term macro trends that create opportunities for a franchise built for growth like Norfolk Southern. We have the right strategy, balancing service, productivity and growth. We have a strong and still improving service product. We have the right team of talented, dedicated railroads, and we are just getting started. We will now open the call to questions, operator?"

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. You may now begin.\n\nLuke Nichols\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone.\nPlease note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.\nOur presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call.\nTurning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe Norfolk Southern team delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, achieving quarterly records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. We also demonstrated our focus on productivity and efficiency with significant OR improvement, as Mark will describe in a moment. Thank you to all the men and women of Norfolk Southern for their remarkable work this quarter and throughout the year, proudly serving our customers and improving the quality of our product.\nWe are qualifying conductors at a robust pace, executing and refining our TOP|SPG operating plan and further strengthening our leadership team and operations. The impact is evident across our network. We see improved operating metrics, such as higher train speeds and shorter dwells. We see improved customer-facing service metrics. We hear improve feedback from customers who are talking to us about adding business. Volume is the lagging indicator, and we are confident our broad and continuing service improvement will drive growth opportunities in the months ahead. Today, the NS team is providing better service, creating network capacity for growth and demonstrating the customer-centric operations-driven approach. That is the foundation of our success.\nDuring the quarter, we reached tentative agreements with the unions that represent our craft colleagues. This was a critical first step. The tentative agreements recognize the significant contributions of our people and keep them among the highest paid craft workers in any industry. In my continuing field visits with frontline railroaders and local supervisors, I've been able to express my appreciation for the vital work they do for Norfolk Southern, our customers and the U.S. economy. Working on the railroad has always been a great opportunity to build a fulfilling career, and we want to keep it that way.\nIn the final days of the cooling off period is the possibility of service disruption [loan]. We took a transparent no-surprises approach to communicating with our customers, which help them make informed decisions about how to keep their goods and materials moving. This is an excellent illustration of what it means to be customer-centric. Even though it created a modest headwind on volume, as Ed will describe, we received positive feedback from many of our customers. We'll take that same no surprises approach every time, because it's how we will deepen customer trust and enhance long-term value creation and growth.\nNow, I'll turn the discussion to Cindy for additional detail on our strong operating progress during the quarter. Cindy?\n\nCynthia M. Sanborn\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood morning. Turning to Slide 5, our resolve to improve service levels is paying off. During the quarter, we executed a smooth rollout of the latest evolution of our PSR-based operating plan, TOP|SPG, and ended the quarter with network velocity more than 20% improved from where it was entering the quarter. As a result, the service recovery glide path we charted earlier this year for the STB is trending well ahead of schedule. We have more improvements to make with progress being fueled by staffing initiatives, TOP|SPG and disciplined field execution. We are gaining momentum and will continue to drive to enhance our customer service and create capacity.\nSlide 6 highlights where we are with staffing levels of our transportation workforce. Our pipeline of trainees remains robust, and we have reached the waypoint target of approximately 7,300 qualified T&E staff a month ahead of schedule. This was accomplished through our innovative approach to recruiting and reinforces the advantage we have to recruit a high-quality craft workforce that takes pride in moving the economy forward. As you heard from Alan, we are pleased to have reached tentative agreements in the quarter to keep that workforce among the highest paid in the nation.\nSlide 7 continues the discussion on service improvements we are making. Last quarter, we shared with you the decision to adjust a couple of our existing major terminals from flat switching to humping. Those shifts went smoothly and are paying dividends today.\nWe are leveraging a similar number of crew starts as we had entering this year inside our yards and terminals and are now moving cars more fluidly through those facilities. As a result, the railcar fleet is moving faster through our terminals. We're operating at high levels of productivity and creating capacity within our switching resources to drive further growth and productivity. As I said last quarter, we will remain flexible to most optimally manage assets, control costs, serve our customers and do so safely.\nMoving to Slide 8. GTMs were flat year-over-year, coupled with crew starts that were up 1%, produced flat train length and weight. We are very focused on the implementation of TOP|SPG in the quarter and are now poised for growth on our train network.\nActive Locomotives were up for the fourth consecutive quarter in support of service recovery. And I am pleased to say that as we regain fluidity over the last couple of months, Active Locomotives are trending down on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. The skill of our mechanical workforce, coupled with our DC to AC modernization strategy, allowed us to deploy search fleet capacities to support service recovery at historic levels of reliability. As I've discussed, we're continuing the modernization program in support of reliability and capacity in the future.\nLastly, this marked our fourth consecutive quarter of fuel efficiency gains, again, due in part to our fleet investments along with shutdown compliance initiatives, augmented with enhanced communications technology and many more efforts.\nSlide 9 hits on a pillar of our digital strategy, Empower the Workforce, which crosses our entire operations group. Through Empower the Workforce, we provide mobile, self-service capabilities to our field forces and enable them to better manage their work with modern mobile applications. They are no longer tied to fixed base reporting and can input and retrieve information when they need it in modern, user-friendly mobile applications. We have a mobility group of technology specialists that are responsible for providing consistent, consumer-grade mobile applications to our transportation, engineering and mechanical forces. Whether it's an application for reporting railcar pickups and set-offs, obtaining track authority or recording bridge inspections, we are providing information where and when our employees need it in order to better manage their workday.\nTo wrap up, Slide 10 is a snapshot of our progress on operating safely. We've been aggressively hiring and have a strong focus on equipping our workforce with the training and tools to perform safely and efficiently. I want to thank our entire workforce for their focus on the job at hand throughout the very dynamic third quarter. I am pleased with our progress, but we'll never be satisfied until we reach zero accidents and injuries.\nThank you, and I will now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nExecutive VP & CMO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone.\nAll right. Turning to Slide 12, let's review our results for the third quarter where we achieved record quarterly results in several categories. Total revenue improved 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion as fuel surcharge and favorable price conditions more than offset a 2% decline in volume. Most notably, revenue per unit, excluding fuel, increased significantly and established a new record in both our merchandise sector and for Norfolk Southern overall. These results reflect a strong price environment and the deliberate efforts of our commercial teams to pursue these opportunities.\nBefore I comment on our individual business groups, I would like to address the impact of our collaborative mitigation efforts in response to a potential labor disruption this quarter. Coming out of August, we were encouraged by the upward trajectory of our volumes. As we move through September and concerns of a labor disruption grew stronger, we acted to guard against the potentially negative impacts on our customers and the communities that we serve in keeping with our no-surprises approach to customer engagement. We spoke with our customers early on about our plans to limit the risk of stranded, hazardous materials and security-sensitive freight like Intermodal by restricting service for these products.\nWe estimate that this approach accounted for roughly 40% to 50% of the volume decline in the quarter or $20 million to $25 million in lost revenue, mostly in our Intermodal markets. Our goal as a customer-centric organization is to gain credibility as a transparent and trusted service provider so that our customers integrate NS further into their supply chain needs. We can only achieve that goal with proactive communication and planning that minimizes disruption. Our customers told us that they appreciated our industry-leading communication, and we're confident that our approach will deliver long-term value for Norfolk Southern, for our shareholders and for our customers. We are pleased that a labor disruption was avoided, and we remain committed to providing quality service that our customers can rely on for their supply chain needs.\nNow continuing to our business group's performance in the third quarter. Merchandise volume was down 2% year-over-year, driven by declines in our steel and ethanol markets that were partially offset by higher demand for sand and aggregates. With respect to steel, service challenges related to equipment availability negatively impacted our ability to meet demand. Ethanol shipments were also down as consumption of gasoline declined in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.\nOn the positive side, shipments of sand increased more than 43% year-over-year on higher demand related to the strong market for natural gas production. Aggregates were also up due to higher levels of construction activity. Merchandise revenue improved 13% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $1.9 billion on higher revenue from fuel surcharges and from price gains.\nMoving on to Intermodal, revenue improved 16% for the quarter despite a 5% decline in volume. Revenue per unit reached a record level this quarter, driven by higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price. Intermodal shipments continue to be pressured by supply chain congestion and equipment shortages. This temporary shift was felt most strongly in our domestic business, where volume was down 4% year-over-year. International Intermodal volume declines were driven primarily by car supply and private chassis shortages, both reducing customer demand for inland point Intermodal and limiting our ability to satisfy that demand.\nLastly, coal market conditions were again favorable for us this quarter, enabling us to deliver 43% growth in revenue for the franchise from volume growth, price improvement and fuel surcharge revenue. Volume growth was led by shipments of utility coal that were up on higher demand spurred by high natural gas prices. Export coal volume was also up due to some carryover from the second quarter and generally improved coal supply. Coal volume growth was partially offset by year-over-year declines in coke shipments due to facility closures.\nOverall, our performance for the quarter reflects continued progress on our strategic plan to drive value for our customers and shareholders while simultaneously working to address pressures related to volume.\nMoving to our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 13. Our service is trending in the right direction, and we expect that to be a tailwind to volumes in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we're optimistic that consumer spending and manufacturing activity will support volumes for the remainder of the year. Those expectations are somewhat muted in light of looming recession risks and tightening financial conditions that are pressuring economic activity, especially in interest rate-sensitive markets like housing.\nVolume in our merchandise segment will benefit from growing activity in automotive markets, with U.S. light vehicle production currently expected to increase in the fourth quarter of '22 compared to 2021. Also contributing to growth will be new opportunities to move corn and other grains. Much of the Southeast corn crop is down significantly versus last year. This is likely to increase demand for Midwest-originated corn by rail. Since emerging from the pandemic low, manufacturing activity has been increasing at a steady rate. But we're beginning to see that growth level off with forecasts calling for growth to moderate to 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\nAs the Fed tightens interest rates, mortgage rates have increased to levels that are cooling the housing market. This reduced demand affects several of our merchandise as well as Intermodal markets. Overall, we expect merchandise volumes to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter with some upside potential as service continues to recover.\nWithin Intermodal, our expectation is for volume to be down slightly year-over-year with opportunities from easing terminal congestion and equipment supply being offset by expectations for weaker demand and a softening truck market.\nOn the domestic side, national Intermodal volume trends are showing signs of slowing, suggesting weaker peak season demand. However, consumer spending, which has historically been a big driver of this market, is currently forecasted to hold steady through the end of the year, providing underlying support for our domestic Intermodal volumes. We continue to see volume opportunity for domestic Intermodal as our service recovers, and we expect customers to shift loads from the highway to rail as we intently focus on improving domestic Intermodal service.\nInternational Intermodal will continue to struggle with congestion and equipment supply, and we expect Intermodal storage charges to remain elevated so long as those issues continue. When supply chain congestion does ease, we expect to deliver additional international volume for customers as Inland Point Intermodal, or IPI, becomes more attractive.\nAnd finally, our expectations for coal are that volumes will continue to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by strength in the markets for both utility and export coal. EIA's latest forecast is for natural gas prices to remain elevated through the end of the year. This will increase demand for coal as a competitive alternative. Seaborne coal prices are expected to remain at relatively high levels through the end of the year, indicating continued demand for U.S. coals abroad. We also anticipate increased coal supply in the fourth quarter, primarily for export, which will create opportunities for coal volume growth.\nTo summarize, we have a number of uncertain market signals in front of us right now, but our focus remains on impacting the things that we can control to deliver quality service to our customers and increase value for our shareholders. Overall, we have a fantastic portfolio of customers. And as always, I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their business and for their ongoing partnership.\nI will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning.\nStarting on Slide 15, Ed walked you through the drivers of our 17% growth in revenues. You'll see operating expense of $355 million or 21%, and that includes a $117 million true-up to our compensation accruals based on the terms of the tentative labor agreements. This resulted in the operating ratio increasing year-over-year to 62% for the quarter. Operating income grew $136 million or 12% despite that headwind. EPS was up 34% or $1.04, thanks to strong earnings growth coupled with share shrink, but also from an adjustment to income tax expense related to Pennsylvania's rate reduction that was enacted in the quarter. You will recall we did signal this in our second quarter earnings release.\nLet's take a moment on Slide 16 to drill specifically into the labor cost adjustments that we reported. As I mentioned, we increased our wage accruals by $117 million in Q3, with $88 million of that amount related to past periods and $29 million related specifically to Q3 2022. The columns represent the period in which the adjustments relate. These amounts, including the impact of the bonus payments, represents more than 2x what we had been assuming. We anticipate another $23 million of incremental expense in Q4, bringing the total amount for the year to $140 million, which represents as much as 110 basis points of headwind to the full year OR from what we had been expecting. It is also worth noting that there is an additional $50 million of incremental label cost that will be capitalized into property additions this year.\nNow let's take a moment on Slide 17 to reconcile the drivers of OR and EPS since there are some movers in the quarter. The impact of the $88 million out-of-period wage accruals in Q3 was meaningful, representing a 270 basis point headwind to the OR and $0.28 on EPS. We did have a favorable legal settlement in the quarter that provided a $0.05 of help to EPS and 40 basis points of help on the OR. The favorable state tax rate change caused a $136 million reduction to our deferred tax liability, which equates to $0.58 of EPS lift. That leaves a core improvement in EPS of $0.69 and improvement in the operating ratio of 50 basis points, which, I'll point out, includes the absorption of 90 basis points of headwind from the $29 million in-period incremental labor cost adjustments that I spoke to on the prior slide.\nMoving now to Slide 18 and the changes in operating expenses of $355 million, which represents a 21% increase year-over-year. Fuel was the primary driver, up $175 million or 84% due almost entirely to price. But as Cindy noted, we did enjoy benefits associated with a 3% fuel efficiency improvement. Compensation and benefits, it is up 21% due to the elevated labor costs associated with the tentative agreements.\nMoving on, you'll see purchase services and rents collectively up $52 million. Inflation and slower network speed continue to drive up these 2 cost categories. Materials, claims and other expenses were down 4% or $7 million year-over-year, helped in part from the $15 million favorable legal settlement in the other category.\nTurning now to Slide 19 for the P&L below operating income. Other income was an expense of $2 million in the quarter, $16 million unfavorable compared to last year driven by losses on the company-owned life insurance investments due to negative equity and fixed income market returns in the quarter. While pretax income was up 11% in the quarter, net income was up 27% due to the 12.4% effective tax rate in the quarter, thanks to the benefit recorded from the state tax rate change. EPS was up 34%, greater than net income growth supported by our capital allocation strategy that includes share repurchases.\nShifting to Slide 20. Cash from operations through 9 months is up $111 million while property additions were higher by $257 million. As we discussed last quarter, I expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range, with materials inflation and now incremental wage inflation creating meaningful headwinds. Free cash flow conversion stands at 86%. Shareholder distributions have been strong this year with a 15% increase to our dividends plus continuing solid share repurchase activity.\nAnd with that, I'll hand back over to Alan.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. Noting the considerable changes that occurred in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the balance of 2022.\nAs you'll see on Slide 21, based on the strong Q3 revenue performance, we now see full year revenue growth of 13% plus year-over-year. Ongoing strength in RPU driven by fuel surcharges and strong price gains are helping us overcome lagging volumes which, as Ed laid out, we expect to be flattish overall in Q4.\nTurning to the operating ratio. We are tracking to our previous guidance, excluding the impact from the tentative labor agreements. Mark laid out $140 million of incremental impact for the year, which is roughly 110 basis points of OR headwind. As such, we now expect the all-in OR for the full year to be roughly 62% based on our current assessment of the market.\nSince I became CEO in May, you have heard me speak to the strengths of our team and culture, our powerful network and the macroeconomic trends supporting highway-to-rail conversion. I have shared some thoughts on our customer-centric operations-driven approach and spoken to the bright future ahead for Norfolk Southern. I continue to be encouraged by my engagements with all of our team members and their commitment to serving our customers. As we approach our December 6 Investor Day, we are eager to share a more detailed view of our long-term strategy for value creation.\nWe will now open the call to questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols, you may now begin.\n\nLuke Nichols\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports, filed with the SEC, for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.\nOur presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to comparable GAAP measures. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call.\nTurning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the second quarter, we stabilized service levels, expanded our pipeline of conductor trainees and launched the next evolution of our operating plan, TOP|SPG with our signature no surprises approach. Service is not yet where we want it to be, but I am encouraged by our progress and inspired by the commitment and shared vision of our talented team. I am privileged to spend a lot of time in the field with our hard-working craft employees and operations supervisors. I see firsthand and sincerely appreciate their daily dedication to serving our customers.\nWe are eager to reach an agreement that keeps our people among the highest paid craft workers of any industry and recognizes their essential service to our customers, our company and the U.S. economy.\nMoving to Slide 4. Thanks to the combined efforts of our team. We delivered solid financial performance in the second quarter with record revenue and earnings per share. Revenue increased 16% as a 20% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 3% volume decline.\nExpenses grew by 21% year-over-year due primarily to higher fuel prices. Operating ratio was up 260 basis points versus last year's quarterly record. Comparisons were adversely impacted by the absence of a large property sale we called out last year as well as fuel price headwinds. Despite these headwinds, EPS improved by 5% and to $3.45 per share, a second quarter record.\nThe steps we are taking today to restore service and implement our new TOP|SPG operating plan are making Norfolk Southern a more customer-centric operations-driven organization that will deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our TOP|SPG operating plan is part of the equation for improving service. We named this iteration, SPG because it creates a platform for consistent service, continuous productivity improvement and smart growth for our customers, Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. There is no doubt we have an enviable value proposition to compete in today's logistics marketplace and where markets are headed.\nAt the conclusion of our prepared remarks, I'll share a few insights on how we will unlock that value.\nI'll now turn the discussion to Cindy for an update on operations and a detailed look at how our company is aligned around restoring service and creating a safe, efficient and reliable product that meets our customers' needs and supports their growth. Cindy?\n\nCynthia M. Sanborn\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. In the second quarter, our team continued to face a challenging operational environment as we work to stabilize service levels, drive productivity gains and increase our T&E workforce. Crew starts were down 3% in the quarter and volumes also down 3% and flat gross ton miles.\nSimilar to what I discussed last quarter, we continue to make gains in crew productivity. However, we would have preferred to run additional crew starts that were limited by staffing challenges. As we promote more of the conductor trainees currently in our pipeline, we will see additional highly productive crew starts that will support more volume and further increases to the record train size we have produced this year.\nDespite the ongoing decision to keep a portion of our surge locomotive fleet active to promote service recovery, we produced another all-time record for fuel efficiency, driven by our multipronged strategy to reduce consumption. This strategy includes the DC to AC conversion program, data-driven solutions to idle reduction and small but powerful investments in friction modification technology, just to name a few components. We expect to drive even better results as we execute on that strategy and enhance the fluidity of our network.\nMoving on to Slide 7. Train speed and terminal dwell remained challenged in the quarter, but we are really encouraged by the improvements we're seeing here in July. We are pulling every lever to restore service levels and delivering for our customers as our top priority. We have a long way to go, and our workforce is dedicated to getting the job done. I'm going to speak over the next few slides about the plan for accomplishing this.\nTurning to Slide 8, which is an update on our T&E staffing progress. We're maintaining a very strong pipeline of conductor trainees. And even more encouraging, as you can see that in July, we're really making progress on getting those employees qualified more than offsetting ongoing attrition. And the impact on our network is being felt.\nWe are continuing to start classes weekly and expect this momentum to continue. I will note that the labor market is still very challenging, particularly in certain locations. We're taking advantage of every option to get folks where we need them, including go teams, transfers, sign-on and attendance bonuses, retirement deferral and referral incentives and more.\nWe're also examining how we can adjust our operation to best align resources with demand. An example of this is that our 2 of our major terminals, Macon and Bellevue, recall that both of these former hump yards were converted to flat switching in 2020. Switching demand has increased in both locations since that time, and we have begun the process of resuming conventional hump operations at both facilities to provide the capacity we need to most expeditiously and efficiently serve our customers with negligible upstart our ongoing costs.\nHaving the ability to return to humping operations as demand dictates is an example of resiliency we now have in our network and a lever we can pull to improve service. We are excited about the talented individuals joining us to help move the economy, and we are confident we will continue to make progress on our staffing priorities.\nOn Slide 9, I am very happy with the progress we've made on our safety initiatives and translating that to fewer injuries and train accidents. Especially with large numbers of new employees starting out in the field, this reinforces that all of our employees, tenured and new alike are laser-focused on running a safe operation, providing a critical foundation for the future.\nNow moving to Slide 10. I'll talk about the progress we've made with rolling out the latest evolution of our operating plan, TOP|SPG. As a reminder, TOP is in an acronym building on the legacy of Thoroughbred Operating Plans. And as Alan noted earlier, SPG signifies the equal prominence of the 3 pillars: service, productivity and growth.\nLate in the second quarter, we launched the plan, which was focused on creating more balance and executability within our network. We looked at how our business rate flows and train composition have changed over the last few years and then couple that with a deep dive on how each of our terminals and routes can best handle the business. We took a fresh approach to balancing the number of crews and locomotives flowing across our core routes.\nI've spoken before about the benefits of distributed power locomotives on longer trains, and as we're creating longer trains, when we rebuilt the plan for when and where we apply distributed power. We looked at prior and prospective train consolidations and weighed what it would take to continue launching and landing longer trains both from a time and resource perspective and made holistic decisions about what is best for service, productivity and growth.\nAs we go forward, we will increase the service frequency in several of our core intermodal markets while simplifying the role of each terminal, particularly where we have more than 1 terminal in each market. This will allow us to drive even more value from our intermodal franchise and will promote executability and growth. Our bulk strategy has a long-term focus.\nIn recent years, we've made solid progress on train consolidations and to a lesser degree, blending with other traffic types. Now we're putting added emphasis on identifying how we can take the remaining unit train network and add an incremental 10, 20 or 30 cars to each train.\nMoving to Slide 11 to discuss a couple of metrics that indicate the early progress we're seeing. First, our arrival train performance has seen substantial improvements here in July. With TOP|SPG we adjusted 90% of our train schedules to meet the service and executability standards I described on the previous slide, and this improvement is very encouraging. As I showed on the network update, our velocity has been improving in July, and this train performance trend reinforces that velocity is translating into trains hitting their slots at an increasing rate.\nOne of the several reasons for this is the strong increase in the number of distributed powertrains we run each day. Team built a solid plan and is now executing it, and this is a component that will directly impact each aspect of SPG as DP trains run smoother, creating service resiliency. They are also more fuel-efficient and shorter trains driving productivity, and they give us a capacity dividend driving growth.\nWe have a long way to go to fully restoring service. These are just a few examples of where we are and further improvements will continue to be driven by 3 primary functions: staffing initiatives paying off; the success of top SPG; and a solid execution by our field workforce.\nThank you, and I will now turn it over to Ed.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nExecutive VP & CMO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 13. Our results for the quarter reflect strong revenue growth amidst still recovering volume from network challenges. We achieved record revenue for the quarter of $3.3 billion. That's up 16% year-over-year on higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price improvement.\nRevenue per unit was also a record and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, saw a double-digit increase from the same period last year. This revenue growth more than offset a 3% decline in overall volume, resulting from service disruptions. Within merchandise, overall volume was down slightly as declines in steel and construction-related shipments from strained network fluidity were partially offset by gains in sand, driven by increased drilling activity in response to rising demand for natural gas, also helping to offset those declines with notable growth in our grain shipments due to rising export demand. Merchandise revenue and revenue per unit were records for the quarter on higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains.\nNow turning to intermodal. Revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel were all up double digits in the second quarter with higher fuel surcharge price gains and higher revenue from storage fees more than offsetting the impact of those volume declines. International intermodal shipments were markedly down year-over-year, driven largely by a shift in our customer base away from inland point intermodal or IPI, in response to ongoing supply chain challenges. Declines in international intermodal were partially offset by modest improvement in domestic shipments year-over-year due to sustained consumer demand.\nRevenue growth was strongest in our coal business unit this quarter with total revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel, all increasing well north of 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. This growth was propelled by price gains, particularly in our export coal markets. Coal volume in the second quarter was negatively impacted by limited supply and facility closures.\nOverall, our performance for the quarter reflects an improving revenue portfolio that will serve as a platform for long-term sustainable revenue growth into the future.\nMoving to our outlook on Slide 14. We're cautiously optimistic that the demand environment will remain strong through the end of 2022, providing opportunities for us to expand our volume and revenue base as fluidity is restored to the network. Despite recession risks amid record inflation and aggressive monetary policy, most economists are still forecasting GDP growth above 1% for both the third and the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn addition, we are beginning to see gas prices moderate nationally and unemployment remains very low, both of which bode well for consumption, which drives many of our markets. Specific to our merchandise segment, we expect volume strength in the second half to be led by our automotive markets where U.S. light vehicle production is currently forecasted to be up 18% over the production levels experienced in the last 6 months of 2021.\nLooking at commodity prices, we see mixed signals for many of our markets, but overall prices remain elevated from those pre-pandemic levels. Manufacturing activity has been a tailwind throughout 2022. However, the outlook is less certain for the remainder of the year.\nLastly, we anticipate overall year-over-year improvements in most of our merchandise markets as our service levels recover. Within intermodal, we expect sequential volume improvement in both our domestic and international lines of business in the second half of 2022 as demand remains strong and service improvements will allow for greater throughput on our network. Backlog demand for container movements will provide opportunities for growth in our domestic franchise.\nIn addition, new opportunities for domestic volume growth exists in the truck and logistics market, and we're laser-focused on driving highway to rail conversions to expand our market share. With respect to our international lines of business, increasing import activity is providing growth opportunities, although lower IPI is a limiting factor. We're also keeping a close eye on truck pricing as rates have fallen, albeit from historically very high levels.\nFinally, our outlook for coal is positive for the second half of the year with growth in our utility and export markets driven by energy demand. Recent declines in export met coal prices suggest we're not likely to realize the same upside potential in RPU that we achieved in the second quarter. Market conditions support year-over-year volume growth in these markets with upside potential driven by coal supply and network fluidity.\nWhile we recognize that uncertainty persists in the macroeconomic environment, we continue to see opportunities for volume growth in the markets that we serve. As part of our execution of our TOP|SPG operating plan, we are committed to capturing these opportunities, expanding our business by delivering the quality service that our customers need to thrive.\nI'll now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Ed. As Alan noted, our EPS grew $0.17 or 5% in the quarter, while the operating ratio contracted 260 basis points. On Slide 16, we reconcile some of the drivers for both of those changes. Recall the $55 million discrete property sale in Q2 of 2021 that impacted our OR by 200 basis points. Also in Q2 last year, there was a state tax law change that impacted EPS by $0.09 and had a 220 basis point favorable impact on last year's Q2 effective tax rate.\nThis year, we have some outsized impacts and claims related to accrual adjustments, but also an accrual related to a legal case. All totaling $16 million, and that creates a 50 basis point headwind on our operating ratio and a $0.05 drag on EPS. That leaves a modest 10 basis point increase in core OR that was heavily impacted by 140 basis points of headwind from fuel.\nShifting to the overall reported highlights on Slide 17. As Ed discussed, revenues grew 16% despite the 3% volume decline, thanks to strong RPU again this quarter. Operating expenses were up 21%, driven in large part by fuel, operating income was up 9%, but net income was flat due to tax rate compares and nonoperating headwinds from company-owned life insurance investments. Despite the flat net income, EPS was up 5% from the lower share count.\nDrilling into the operating expense components on Slide 18, nearly 2/3 of the increase in operating expense is from higher fuel costs. Increase of material and other of $75 million is affected by the $55 million property gain we called out last year and the $16 million of items that I spoke about earlier. Purchased services and rents are impacted by both inflation and our current service situation. The slower network speed is a critical driver impacting the higher equipment rents, while purchased services captures higher rates for our third-party lift contractors as well as our IT contractors.\nCompensation and benefits is a tailwind with lower incentive accruals, offsetting the cost of trainees as well as general wage inflation. As you can imagine, the current labor negotiations are likely to play out here in the second half and may result in incremental headwinds to comp and benefits that we are unable to estimate at this time.\nShifting to the P&L below operating income on Slide 19. Other income is actually an expense in the quarter of $14 million, driven by losses on our company-owned life insurance investments.\nI know this line item is difficult to estimate and model. So let me provide some clarity to help you, at least directionally. This account is a collection of nonoperating income and expense items that typically nets to about $15 million of income per quarter. On top of this, we have returns on our company-owned life insurance investments. A portion of this asset, roughly $525 million is invested in a traditional blend of equities and fixed income, and we mark to market each quarter.\nThese are noncash gains or losses. And it's important to note that neither the gains nor losses from these investments are subject to income tax. As such, the effective tax rate in this quarter was a bit higher than usual at 24.7%. While net income was exactly flat, earnings per share increased 5% due to the accumulation of our share repurchases in the past year.\nGoing back to income tax for a moment, I would also like to highlight that Pennsylvania enacted legislation in July to reduce their state tax rate. And the accounting for that change will have a roughly $135 million onetime noncash favorable adjustment to income tax expense in the third quarter.\nNow turning to free cash flow on Slide 20. We've generated nearly $1.2 billion in free cash flow through 6 months with property additions trending higher than last year, with strong progress being made on both our rail replacement program, and our DC to AC locomotive conversion program, where, as Cindy touched upon, we gain operational benefits as well as improved fuel efficiency. Incremental inflation is also having an impact on property additions. So I would expect CapEx to be at the high end of our $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range. Shareholder distributions are up and you'll observe here the 19% higher dividend payments through 6 months on top of continued strong share repurchase activity.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to Alan.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. I'll conclude with an update on our outlook for the year and brief thoughts on our strategy for long-term value creation. You'll see on Slide 21, our confidence in the revenue outlook has improved the 12% plus year-over-year growth. Underpinning the improved revenue outlook, a strong first half performance, continued strength in fuel surcharge revenues and better sequential volumes associated with service improvement in the back half of 2022.\nOur first half operating ratio was the result of a delayed service recovery and elevated fuel prices. These headwinds will translate into a deterioration in full year operating ratio. Although we expect the back half OR to improve from the first half as our service recovery ramps, allowing us to absorb more volume and reduce costs associated with our service challenges. As Mark mentioned, we do not know if there will be any incremental costs recorded in 2022 associated with a resolution in our labor negotiations.\nTurning to Slide 22. Although our focus today is on restoring service in the short term, our vision extends much further. As I complete my first 100 days as CEO, I'd like to share some insights on our future. The work we are doing now to improve service is only the beginning.\nWe're going to build long-term resiliency into our network, creating sustainable value for our customers. Norfolk Southern has a franchise that is built for growth, being customer-centric and operations-driven, propels Norfolk Southern to a service organization that will compete and win on operational excellence, leveraging the strengths of our powerful network to achieve above-market growth. Our value proposition starts with the investments we've made over decades to build a robust network that faces the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy.\nOur markets extend globally through our strong working relationships with ports all along the East Coast, The Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. We have cultivated more than 250 short line partnerships, the most of any Class 1 railroad, extending the reach of our network even further and creating even more options for our customers. We have long-standing relationships with a desirable portfolio of valued customers, reflecting a diversity as broad as the U.S. economy.\nOur automotive, metals, agriculture and consumer products markets are enduring strengths, and our unparalleled intermodal franchise will be an increasing driver of long-term growth. Our best-in-class channel partners and industry-leading industrial development team position us well to capitalize on the growth of e-commerce and the acceleration of onshore as we move Norfolk Southern forward. Leveraging the sustainability advantage of our service product will give us another compelling selling point as more shippers prioritize Scope 3 emissions reduction in the years ahead.\nWe'll keep driving forward with industry-leading technologies, enhancing our productivity and efficiency and creating a best-in-class consumer-oriented experience that makes it easier for customers to do business with Norfolk Southern. Consistent, convenient, cost-effective service will enable shippers to build their supply chains around the inherent advantages of our network. We will deliver the simplicity of truck with the efficiency of rail.\nThis is how we will achieve our vision of a customer-centric, operations-driven organization and compete successfully in the $800 billion plus truck and logistics market.\nWhen I talk to my colleagues throughout Norfolk Southern, from our headquarters to our rail yards, I am energized. Our people are passionate about serving our customers and proud of the essential role we play in moving the American economy. Our team is the reason we will be successful.\nWe are building a winning culture with innovation as a core competency where people confidently bring forward their best ideas, continuously develop their skills and feel valued for their contributions. We look forward to sharing more about our strategy for long-term shareholder value creation in the months ahead.\nWe will now open the call to questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nMeghan Achimasi\n\nSenior Director of IR, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone.

A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President, Alan Shaw.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to start by recognizing the contributions of Norfolk Southern's employees, who have worked safely and tirelessly to serve our customers in a challenging supply chain environment.\nI sincerely appreciate the commitment of our employees to Norfolk Southern and our customers. Norfolk Southern delivered solid financial performance in the first quarter with record first quarter revenue, earnings per share and net income, while our operating and marketing teams worked around the clock with our customers to address current network challenges and a dynamic supply chain.\nWe know we need to improve service and are committed to increasing network fluidity and restoring service to levels our customers deserve. Cindy will share updates on our accelerated hiring and progress of our new operating plan, TOP|SPG.\nViewing the results for the quarter, you'll note that revenue increased 10% as a 16% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 5% volume decline. Expenses grew over $200 million or 13% year-over-year, due primarily to a sharp increase in fuel price.\nHigher fuel costs, along with slower network velocity and reduced volume contributed to an increase in our operating ratio, which was up 130 basis points versus last year's first quarter record.\nWe remain confident in our ability to improve service while simultaneously delivering productivity and growth. Our outlook is bright. I'll now turn the discussion to Cindy for an update on operations. Cindy?\n\nCynthia M. Sanborn\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk to you all today about the outlook for our operations. During the past quarter, resource levels have challenged the fluidity of our operation, yet we have continued our momentum on increasing train size.\nWe are in the very early days of seeing the fruits of our hiring initiatives and are working every avenue to improve service levels as quickly as possible. I'll provide an update on our Thoroughbred operating plan initiative, as well as what we're doing with technology to make the railroad safer and more productive.\nFirst, turning to Slide 6, is a recap of our operational activity metrics in the quarter, GTMs were down slightly, outperforming the unit volume decline as mix shifted modestly towards our heavier merchandise and coal segments. Our crew starts were down 5% in the quarter, which is a good news, bad news story.\nResource levels prohibited us from operating some starts that we would have preferred to operate, and our recovery mechanism was challenged as a result.\nHowever, on the positive side of the ledger, we continue to drive very beneficial road train consolidations across our segments, most pronounced in our boat franchise as we move similar coal tonnage with 6% fewer train starts and saw train weight up across the board for intermodal, merchandise and bulk.\nIn an effort to improve resiliency, we kept a portion of the surge locomotive fleet active, yet we still achieved another quarter of fuel efficiency improvement.\nTurning to network performance on Slide 7, train speed and terminal dwell closely resembled the levels they were at in the fourth quarter. Qualified T&E levels continued to decline throughout the quarter, culminating in what we expect to be the trough in March.\nAs we start to see relief in certain areas, we are prioritizing crew starts that can have the most impact on customer service levels, and we are redeploying our Go Teams when possible.\nI want to reiterate that improving service levels is our top priority. And turning to Slide 8, I will provide more detail on where we are with our hiring efforts. As we progress through 2021, we quickly identified the need to increase hiring within our transportation workforce.\nWe were met with a very challenging labor market that made our ramp-up time longer than expected, but we responded with a robust plan to streamline our preemployment process, deploy a variety of financial incentives and mobilize additional onboarding resources.\nThese efforts have paid off in a big way in 2022, and we now have over 800 conductor trainees on the property. As a result, we now expect our qualified T&E headcount to begin growing sequentially throughout the remainder of the year.\nWe are laser-focused on utilizing these additional employees to improve service levels and provide a solid platform from which to launch TOP|SPG, which I will discuss on Slide 9.\nAs we did last quarter, I want to reiterate the approach of focusing on service, productivity and growth as equal pillars in our latest evolution of the TOP plan, which we envision launching in late second quarter.\nLet's talk about service quality and resiliency first. Several key elements of PSR are having a simple and executable operation as well as having a balance.\nYou heard us talk about some of these PSR fundamentals when TOP21 was rolled out, and we now need to revisit a few of them with a renewed focus, while ensuring they are embedded in all of our segments, including intermodal.\nOne of the greatest strengths of our network is the quality and positioning of our intermodal franchise. And as we've performed the zero-based review of how we link together our major markets, we found opportunities to simplify how we connect those terminals while providing more capacity than what we have today.\nThis will include ensuring we have assets flowing across our network in a balanced fashion, so that less intervention is required for resources to be in the right place at the right time. Let me be clear, TOP|SPG is another lever we're pulling to improve our service and represents an evolution of our current operating plan.\nThis pathway towards enhanced service will allow us to better plan forward and execute longer trains. Additionally, going back to the idea of encompassing all business segments, while we've made great progress on enhancing book train sizes within coal, there is more runway ahead.\nOther facets of the bulk network such as grain, will see benefits as we develop the capability to run longer trains through those parts of the network, such as the Midwest.\nThis productivity dividend is very complementary to the service pillar as it will give us more flexibility to handle commodity volatility. These improvements in train productivity have obvious benefits of reducing labor intensity but will also propel further fuel efficiency improvements.\nFinally, these efforts will ensure that we grow capacity within our terminals and along our main lines, including the initiatives I've discussed with you before, to bolster our infrastructure with targeted siding extensions that are actively coming online.\nWe are going to provide the capacity our customers want to grow with us, organically while still creating the flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to new opportunities.\nMoving to our safety update on Slide 10. We have seen improvement in both FRA train accidents per ton miles moved as well as the FRA injury index year-over-year.\nHowever, we will not be satisfied as long as there is a single injury or accident. Which is why we continue our efforts to get better in this area every day. First, on the engagement front. In 2021, we conducted our first annual safety survey, which was across the entire workforce.\nThis has provided us with insight on what and where we need to focus our engagement efforts. We've expanded our field training program to leverage outlets such as online training, classroom training and our signature safety train events, so that we empower our workforce to actively engage in our goal of continuous improvement, when it comes to safety.\nLastly, we're making great progress building momentum with technology investments that are focused on safe and efficient operations, and I'll give a great example on Slide 11 with an update where we are with one of our key technology pillars: automation.\nMore specifically, we are using machine vision technology to detect component failures before they occur. We're in the process of deploying fully-automated inspection corridors, which will cover more than 90% of the cars moving across our network, using a variety of systems to detect signs and symptoms of pending failures before they occur.\nEqually as important as deploying the hardware, is developing the next-generation AI algorithms that detect these failures with edge computing and procedures for intervening quickly.\nThis is where we've made really exciting progress, and we are already actively preventing incidents. We are finding that the technology is enabling us to achieve better outcomes than the human eyes alone can achieve.\nOne reason for this is the power of seeing how these components are behaving on a train in motion versus while stationary during a manual inspection. We're generating high success rates with very few false positives and detecting components that need to be replaced but had no outward indication to the human eye.\nThe close and effective working relationship between our data scientists and field team is creating a feedback loop that is accelerating our progress. This is one of the most revolutionary technologies we are working on, and I'm extremely excited for what we are achieving with our relentless pursuit of safety first and productivity. I will now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nClaude E. Elkins\n\nExecutive VP & CMO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. If you would, let's turn to Slide 13. Our results for the first quarter [lagged] challenges that we experienced on the volume side with supply chain constraints and network fluidity. These were offset by record success in revenue per unit.\nOverall, our volume decreased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by declines in our intermodal, automotive and steel franchises. But despite these volume declines, total revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $2.9 billion due to higher revenue from fuel surcharges and strong price gains.\nWithin merchandise, volume declines were led by automotive and steel for chip supply and equipment cycle time challenges significantly inhibited our ability to drive growth. Partially offsetting these decreases were gains in agri fuels, feed and aggregates due to increased gasoline consumption, higher demand for Agriculture products and rising levels of construction spending.\nHigher fuel revenue and price improvement more than offset the headwinds from volume and mix that generate 4% revenue growth year-over-year, along with record-level revenue per unit. Revenue per unit less fuel was also a record for the quarter.\nTotal intermodal shipments declined 6% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by the international market, where tight drayage capacity, high street dwell for chassis and warehouse throughput drove customers to seek alternatives to Inland Point Intermodal, or IPI.\nDomestic shipments grew modestly year-over-year on sustained consumer demand that outpaced supply. However, as network velocity improves, and as TOP|SPG is implemented, we're confident that we will provide the capacity our customers need to grow.\nHigher revenue from fuel surcharges was the leading driver of intermodal revenue growth this quarter, followed by storage revenue, price improvement and positive mix, all leading the record quarterly revenue metrics for the franchise.\nIntermodal revenue per unit less fuel grew for the 21st consecutive quarter. Now moving to coal. Total volume was down slightly year-over-year in the first quarter as gains in utility shipments were offset by declines in export coal. Utility growth was driven by higher levels of demand for electric power and the need to replenish depleted inventories.\nOur export franchise experienced a number of acute service disruptions that limited shipments for a period of time, resulting in a year-over-year decline.\nBut despite these volume headwinds, coal revenue grew 25%, primarily due to price gains, underscoring the near-term market demand opportunities we effectively secured. Revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel reached record levels this quarter.\nNow let's turn to Slide 14 for our market outlook for the remainder of 2022. In general, we anticipate continued, consumer-driven strength in demand and improvements in our service product. Both of these will enable us to deliver year-over-year volume and revenue growth in 2022.\nHowever, we are closely monitoring a base of uncertainty in the macro economy, including inflation at levels we haven't seen in over 40 years, rising interest rates and evolving post-pandemic labor market and ongoing global geopolitical conflict.\nMerchandise volume growth will be led by Agriculture, Forest and Consumer products, where we're seeing elevated demand for products such as soybeans and corn, as global food supply chains face ongoing uncertainty.\nThe USDA recently increased their expectations for export soybeans from the U.S. amid declining foreign availability and highlighted rising demand for corn, both of which create opportunities for rail transportation.\nAlso contributing to volume gains, will be automotive, for U.S. light vehicle production is expected to improve 19% year-over-year in the month of April through December on improving chip supply.\nTotal construction spending in the U.S. has been steadily increasing since mid-2020 and currently sits at the highest level on record, signaling opportunities for our construction-related markets.\nWithin intermodal, our expectation is for a healthy and resilient consumer in 2022, based on a strong balance sheet, suggest an increased spending power from excess savings despite record-high inflationary pressures.\nGrowth in the consumer-led economy will drive demand for our domestic intermodal service, which we expect will benefit from service improvements in the second half of the year and drive growth to offset the volume declines that we experienced at the start of the year.\nSustained tightness in the [truck] market and rising diesel fuel prices are both contributing to an economic environment that encourages highway to rail conversion and provides a superior value proposition for our customers because of our fuel efficiency advantage, especially when compared to the highway.\nFor our international franchise, we're working diligently to create the capacity our channel partners need to take advantage of the opportunities on Norfolk Southern. Our efforts are expected to boost volume recovery and drive year-over-year growth in intermodal this year.\nAnd lastly, turning to coal. Record-high seaborne prices continue in an already-strong market that is amplified by geopolitical tensions. This will provide opportunities in the near term. Pricing is expected to remain a tailwind in the export markets.\nUtility shrink continues with higher natural gas prices, though it will continue to be counteracted by higher coal prices. Inventories are still lower than target, heading into the summer season. In our domestic met market, consumer demand remains high for domestic receivers.\nCoal supply availability and production remain tight in every market, which will be the determining factor in upside potential. Overall, we're confident in the growth potential for Norfolk Southern for the remainder of the year. And we expect to deliver revenue and volume growth over last year.\nI would like to thank our customers for their partnership and reiterate that we remain intently focused on improving service and driving value for our customers and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Thank you.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Ed. I'm on Slide 16. We delivered double-digit revenue and EPS growth in the first quarter. Both were record levels for NS. Starting with revenues, the 10% growth was despite the 5% volume decline, thanks to the strong RPU growth that Ed just detailed.\nOperating expenses were up 13%, driven in large part by a sharp increase in fuel prices, but also higher costs related to our network challenges. Despite revenue dollar growth exceeding OpEx dollar growth, we experienced a 130 basis point increase in our operating ratio.\nRecall that at the first quarter conferences, we previewed pressure on our OR compared to our original expectation of flattish sequentially due to lighter volumes that we were experiencing to start the year and also the rapid rise in fuel expense.\nThe way it landed, fuel prices alone represented 100 basis points of OR headwind relative to our expectations, as well as year-over-year. We also booked an accrual adjustment within claims expense that created another 40 basis points of headwind.\nThe volume shortfall also adversely impacted OR as we previewed, along with incremental service-related costs. These were only partially offset by the strong RPU improvements.\nOR side, the operating income and earnings per share were both Q1 records, growing 7% and 10%, respectively. Drilling into the breakdown of operating expenses in the quarter on Slide 17, you'll see that 60% of the $206 million increase in the quarter was from higher fuel prices on a year-over-year basis.\nPurchased services was up $31 million or 10%, driven in large part from inflation and service-related costs that more than offset benefits, that would typically come from lower volumes.\nEquipment rents increased $13 million or 17%, driven by slower network velocity and less equity earnings from TTX. The $20 million increase in materials and others is driven by a $13 million accrual adjustment in claims related to the 2017 through 2020 years, based on an actuarial study.\nComp and benefits were up 1%, with compensation inflation offsetting savings from lower employee levels in several categories. Qualified T&E employees were down, mostly offset by conductor trainees. The unwanted attrition of qualified T&E employees drove higher overtime cost to move the freight.\nShifting to Slide 18. In a discussion of the P&L below operating income, other income was a $5 million expense in the quarter, driven largely by losses on the company-owned life insurance investments.\nPretax income was up 5%, while net income was up 4%. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, in line with the 23% to 24% range that we guide. EPS was up 10% on the 4% net income growth, thanks to nearly 2.2 million shares repurchased in the quarter. We're moving nearly 1% of the outstanding shares.\nClosing with cash flow and shareholder distributions on Slide 19, free cash flow was $605 million, down 19% from last year due to property additions in Q1 this year that are $124 million higher.\nRecall Q1 2021 property additions were quite low to start the year, due in part to weather. Free cash flow conversion in the first quarter was a healthy 86%.\nDespite a lower free cash flow year-over-year, shareholder distributions were nearly 7% higher, with a 19% higher dividend payment and modestly-higher share repurchases. We'll now turn it back to Alan for a wrap up.\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. Turning to Slide 20. We show multiple approaches on how we're building upon our record of sustainability leadership. With the launch of our next-generation carbon calculator in mid-March, we've made it easier for customers to do business with us, incorporating carbon into their freight decision framework with quantifiable benefits of utilizing the most efficient and least carbon-intensive mode of ground transportation.\nAlso in March, we announced the continuation of our locomotive modernization program in partnership with Wabtec, which will improve our operational performance and reliability and help us achieve our science-based target emission reductions, up 42% by 2034.\nThe pace of our sustainability initiatives has increased and is recognized in the industry as evidenced by several prestigious awards received in the quarter, including named as a Supplier Engagement Leader by Carbon Disclosure Project for 2021, recognized with the 2022 Green Bond of the Year award from Environmental Finance and earning the Responsible Care Energy Efficiency Award for Locomotive Fuel Efficiency from the American Chemistry Council.\nWe are incredibly proud of our progress in this area, and we will continue to build upon our sustainability initiatives, which are good for business and the right thing to do for all of our stakeholders.\nLet me close by confirming our commitment to deliver our targets this year. Our confidence at this stage is based on our assessment of economic indicators, which at this time remain supportive of manufacturing and consumer activity, as well as our service recovery efforts associated with accelerated hiring and the successful implementation of TOP|SPG.\nThese factors will support healthy volume growth in the back half of the year. In fact, potential upside exists to our revenue outlook, and energy prices remain elevated throughout the year. As you've heard from our entire team, we are disappointed with our current service levels.\nWe are laser-focused on restoring the quality of our product to a level that allows our customers to succeed and grow. We are confident that our decisive actions to restore service, including hiring and the launch of TOP|SPG, will create long-term sustained value for our customers and shareholders, leveraging our unique franchise strengths.\nBefore we open the call to questions, I want to take the opportunity to thank our retiring CEO, Jim Squires for his tremendous leadership to our company over the past 30 years. During Jim's tenure as CEO, NS improved our operating ratio by more than 1,200 basis points, more than doubled our market cap and returned over $17 billion to our shareholders.\nHe led our company through the challenges of our freight recession and global pandemic. Jim launched an industry-leading digital transformation strategy, elevated sustainability to a strategic business priority and personally championed diversity and inclusion. And Jim united our team and the new headquarters in Midtown Atlanta last year.\nOn behalf of all NS employees, retirees and stakeholders, thank you, Jim. And we wish you and your family all the best in your well-earned retirement. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?"

Welcome to Norfolk Southern Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\nThank you, Ms. Achimasi, you may begin.\n\nMeghan Achimasi\n\nSenior Director of IR, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone.\nPlease note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures.\nAlong those lines, recall 2 adjustments during 2020, including a noncash charge in the first quarter of 2020 related to the sale of 703 locomotives for $385 million, and a $99 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2020 related to an equity method investment. We will speak to full year comparisons, excluding those charges from 2020.\nA full transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman and CEO, Jim Squires.\n\nJames A. Squires\n\nChairman & CEO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to be joined by Alan Shaw, President; Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me start by acknowledging and thanking the entire NS team for the tremendous effort that's gone into the fulfillment of our financial targets established in our 3-year strategic plan. 2021 serves as the pinnacle of the plan and is marked by the achievement of our 60% full year operating ratio and record productivity levels across our operation.\nThrough a multiyear effort, we delivered on our commitments, overcoming significant headwinds associated with first freight recession and then a global pandemic over the course of our plan. In the past 3 years, we've produced industry-leading total shareholder return. We've grown EPS by 27%, reduced our operating ratio by 530 basis points and returned nearly $10 billion back to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We met and exceeded our goals, albeit with a very different formula than originally anticipated given the volume headwinds and demonstrating our ability to adapt and innovate and our dedication to deliver upon our commitments.\nI'm so proud to be a part of this team and humbled to service its leader. We're poised to build upon our momentum and write a new record book. The company is in rock solid position, and we have the right team to guide our next chapter of success.\nWith that, I welcome Ed to his new role as Chief Marketing Officer and congratulate Alan on his appointment as President. It's my pleasure now to turn the discussion over to Alan for a detailed look at the fourth quarter and full year results. Alan?\n\nAlan H. Shaw\n\nPresident, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim.\nAs Jim noted, 2021 represents a combination of our multiyear plan, and I'm pleased to share with you the progress we made in the fourth quarter. As you see from our results on Slide 5. Revenue growth of 11% outpaced our expense increase of 8%, producing an 18% improvement in earnings per share and a fourth quarter record operating ratio of 60.4%. For the full year, revenues improved 14%, which more than offset the 6% increase in operating expenses. We delivered the hallmark 60% operating ratio for the full year, an improvement of 430 basis points over the adjusted full year 2020 results and our 6th consecutive year of improvement.\nWe are excited to share more details of our results, and you'll hear from both Cindy and Ed about work to iterate on the next phase of our Thoroughbred operating plan that will serve as the framework for our continued progress on service, productivity and growth.\nI'll first turn to Cindy for a review of our operations. Cindy?\n\nCynthia M. Sanborn\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning.\nDuring the fourth quarter, headwinds from the tight labor market created acute operational challenges across several parts of our network. While working to overcome the workforce planning hurdles, we remain focused on leveraging productivity initiatives to move freight for our customers. These efforts did bear fruit, but our service quality was significantly below where we needed it to be. I'm going to discuss with you today the strategic approach we are taking to change this.\nTurning to Slide 7. Pronounced changes in business mix were evidenced by the unit volume decline of 4% while GTMs were up 1%. Productivity gains were key to handling volumes in the quarter as the transportation workforce contracted by 8%. The reduction in crew starts of 4%, growth in train weight of 10% and growth in train length of 8% were critical elements of this productivity formula as well. Where active locomotive count increased by 5% as the network slowed, we kept focus on efficiently deploying those locomotives on the larger trains, which helped drive the 3% improvement in fuel efficiency.\nAs I mentioned a few moments ago, you can see the degradation of network fluidity on Slide 8. We regained a modest amount of ground over the holidays and as we're entering the first quarter, our improvements have been sporadic as COVID-related absences have more than doubled from where they were in December.\nLet me be clear, our top priority is to drive the service improvements our customers expect and need and we will get there. We are working very hard to leverage and increased hiring pipeline as well as productivity initiatives to drive our performance.\nNext, I'll provide more details on the hiring process on Slide 9. We've made significant progress in ramping up resources to improve the pace of hiring while pursuing productivity. And as shown on the slide, we are pulling 5 key levers to do so, including: number one, incorporating additional recruiting and training resources to increase hiring. Employees from across the company have volunteered to provide support in our principal training facility and it's all hands on deck; number two, streamlining the hiring and onboarding process. We've trimmed weeks from the process of first identifying a candidate to have them on board; three, increasing trainee pay and offering incentives such as signing, retention and referral bonuses; four, lengthening and combining trains. We've made solid progress in this regard; and finally, five, we're using a variety of techniques to optimize our existing crews, including realigning crew districts and making crew bases more fungible. Our people are getting creative and rising to the challenge, and resource additions are bearing fruit as we've onboarded over 3x more conductor trainees in January than any month in 2021. These trainees will promote throughout the second quarter, which is when we expect to start improving train and engine service staffing levels. We do expect to see some relief in critical crew bases during Q1 as trainees that started in 2021 became promoted, though we are still experiencing high levels of attrition in those same areas.\nOn average, we expect the number of certified train and engine employees in 2022 to approximate that of 2021 and are expecting GTMs per employee to increase. So when looking at the year as a whole, our plan is to leverage productivity gains to absorb volume growth while getting the workforce rebalanced to drive improvements in service quality.\nLet's unpack the productivity discussion a little more on Slide 10. We've improved average train weight and length 21% and 20%, respectively, since mid-2019 when TOP21 was launched. This has been a key to our success and will continue to be so going forward. Larger trains reduce labor intensity, improve locomotive productivity, improve fuel efficiency and provide our customers with a platform for growth. We have efforts in the pipeline to continue this trend: first, on the infrastructure front, in 2021, we launched work on 9 siding extensions, one of which was quickly completed and in service by the fourth quarter. Most of the others will be completed throughout 2022; second, are very capital efficient and high-performing DC to AC locomotive modernization program is ongoing. As a reminder, this is a dual-purpose program to rebuild engines at the end of their life while converting them to the latest and greatest technology. In 2021, we improved our fleet composition to nearly 60% AC power and 65% of our road fleet is capable of distributed power. Both of these aid with running larger trains; lastly, our operating plan and growth initiatives must be well aligned to add capacity to existing trains, which brings me to Slide 11.\nIn 2022, we have already kicked off the next generation of our PSR-based operating plan, which we are calling TOP SPG. While you may be familiar with an SS legacy of Thoroughbred Operating Plans, or TOP, the next-generation SPG represents a new era of service, productivity and growth, three equally important facets of our new operating plan. We are embarking on this next era because we have significant improvements that need to be made in each of these areas, service, productivity and growth to reach our full potential. We are taking a ground-up approach to the development of the plan in order to explore what is possible when we remove historical constraints and take a fresh look at our business. We are leveraging lessons learned from the first 3 years of PSR operations under TOP21 and using a rich data set to execute in a customer-centric collaborative process. We look forward to keeping you updated as this initiative unfolds throughout the year.\nThank you, and I'll now turn it over to Ed.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone.\nNow beginning on Slide 13. I will highlight our results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue improved 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion as strong demand and favorable price conditions more than offset the 4% volume decline in the fourth quarter. Volume was impacted by the continuation of the extraordinary global supply chain disruptions and slower network velocity. Pricing and strength across all markets contributed to the 15% increase in revenue per unit, and we reached record revenue per unit less fuel across all of our markets.\nThis demonstrates our ongoing commitment to execute our yield up strategy and drive value for both our customers and our shareholders. Within merchandise, volume growth in the fourth quarter was led by our chemicals franchise as rising economic activity drove demand for chemical products, particularly for crude oil and natural gas liquids. Gains in our metals business also contributed to growth with volume in these markets up 6% year-over-year on sustained high demand from the strengthening manufacturing sector, partially offsetting merchandise growth was a decline in automotive shipments, which were down 9% year-over-year due to slower velocity coupled with strong comps in the fourth quarter of 2020 when the industry was boosted by pent-up demand.\nMerchandise revenue per unit increased 6% year-over-year, driving total revenue growth of 8% to $1.7 billion for the quarter. Revenue per unit less fuel for this market reached a record level in the fourth quarter. We've demonstrated year-over-year growth in this metric for 26 of the last 27 quarters, which further demonstrates our ability to drive sustainable revenue growth.\nOur intermodal franchise continued to face pressure from supply chain volatility, resulting in a volume decline of 7% year-over-year. Strong consumer demand and elevated imports stress these supply chains and exceeded drage capacity and equipment availability. This negatively affected both our domestic and our international markets. But despite these headwinds, we achieved record intermodal revenue in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year, and that was driven by increased fuel revenue, storage revenue and price gains. Revenue per unit less fuel grew for the 20th consecutive quarter.\nNow turning to coal. Revenue increased 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, which was driven by price gains and higher demand in a tightly supplied market. Coal revenue per unit reached near record levels and increased 16% year-over-year. Our export markets continue to benefit from high seaborne coal prices, which increased the competitiveness of U.S. coals in the global market. Shipments of domestic met and coke were particularly strong this quarter on higher demand to support steel production.\nIf you'll turn to Slide 14. Full year 2021 revenue grew 14% to $11.1 billion on 5% volume growth. All of our markets posted gains, reflecting strong demand for our product coming out of the pandemic, tempered by supply chain pressures experienced throughout the year. Revenue growth was strongest in our merchandise franchise, where all lines of business, but particularly metals and construction, benefited from higher demand and favorable price conditions associated with the economic recovery. Intermodal growth was driven by elevated consumer activity and tight truck capacity.\nTotal revenue increased on higher seaborne coal prices and growth in steel production activity. We reached record levels of both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Both metrics were up year-over-year due to price gains, storage charges and higher fuel revenue in the case of total revenue per unit. And as markets have evolved, we've leveraged favorable conditions to drive improvement for our bottom line.\nNow let's look ahead to our outlook for 2022 on Slide 15. We're optimistic that our business will continue to grow despite the ongoing uncertainty in the economy. We're increasingly confident that supply chain conditions, including rail network velocity will improve as the year progresses. Overall, the demand environment for our service is strong. We're committed to working with our customers and channel partners to develop sustainable solutions to maximize our opportunities ahead. We remain focused on our ability to deliver value for our customers and leverage market conditions throughout 2022.\nAs Cindy explained, both our hiring plan and the development and implementation of TOP SPG will deliver increased fluidity, efficiency and network capacity as the year progresses and our volume pattern will follow that same sequential improvement trend. This will allow our customers to provide additional value to their customers for their product and build a strong platform for future growth. Market conditions for our merchandise franchise are expected to be favorable with several customers announcing expansions in the new year that will create opportunities.\nIn addition, industrial production is projected to grow 4% in 2022, which will drive demand for most of our markets, particularly for our steel markets. Residential construction spending is forecasted to grow more than 6% this year, following the sharp increase in 2021, supporting continued gains in several of our industrial markets. U.S. light vehicle production is expected to reach 10.3 million units this year, which is approaching pre-pandemic levels of 2019. This recovery will have a positive impact on both our automotive and our metals volumes in 2022.\nDemand for our intermodal market is expected to remain favorable despite continued headwinds associated with supply chain congestion impacting our ability to capture new opportunities. These headwinds are expected to ease in the second half of the year, creating a more favorable environment for growth. And furthermore, a robust consumer economy, elongated inventory replenishment cycles and a tight truck market support our growth plan. Durable goods consumption is expected to improve 3% and that's on top of the near-record 19% growth in 2021. This also bodes well for our intermodal franchise.\nOur outlook for coal is more guarded as some of the drivers of 2021 growth shows signs of easing in 2022 despite some potential opportunities in the near term. Seaborne prices remain high. However, they have begun to decline, leading subdued optimism going into the new year. Expected increases in global production will likely contribute to downward pressure on these seaborne coal prices and lower the demand for export coal. In the utility markets, while there's been strength associated with higher natural gas prices, that upside will be determined by coal supply as production levels remain high.\nNow before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to highlight our new NSites portal on Slide 16. The pandemic has pushed manufacturers to redesign their supply chains in favor of certainty of supply and locating inventory closer to customers. Our best-in-class industrial development team is at the forefront of these efforts, and they launched an innovative solution to drive value for our customers and support development in the communities that we serve. NSites is a comprehensive search tool for rail, search industrial sites and transload facilities on our network. It allows users to create customized search parameters to quickly identify industrial sites that meet their unique needs. And more importantly, this portal makes it easier to do business with NS and helps our customers make informed long-term investment decisions that will promote economic activity and create jobs. We're excited to provide this product to our customers and help them expand their business on Norfolk Southern. Overall, we are grateful for our strong customer partnerships, and we look forward to growing our business in 2022 with a continued emphasis on improving our service and driving value for our customers and for our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Thank you.\n\nMark R. George\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Norfolk Southern Corporation\n\nThank you. Starting with Slide 18. As Ed noted, revenue was up 11% despite a 4% volume decline. This more than offset an 8% increase in operating expense, which led to 140 basis points of operating ratio improvement to a fourth quarter record of 60.4%.\nImprovements in RPU, coupled with strong productivity led to a record Q4 operating income with growth of 15% or $145 million. And we set another record for free cash flow, up 30% or $642 million for the full year.\nMoving to a drill down of operating expenses on Slide 19. While operating expense grew $134 million or 8%, it is up less than 3% or $44 million, apart from fuel cost increases. The $90 million headwind for fuel is driven almost entirely by price. You'll see purchase services and rents of $46 million with the majority of the year-over-year increase driven by the same drivers we talked about on the Q3 call, higher expenses associated with Conrail, higher technology spend associated with our technology strategy, higher drainage expense associated with more hourly drivers used to alleviate terminal congestion primarily in Chicago, and we continue to see inflationary pressure on lift expenses going forward as it relates to contractor labor availability.\nMoving on to compensation and benefits. It is up 2%, but you'll note the $33 million in savings from 6% lower headcount and that more than offset increases in pay rates and overtime. Meanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $24 million. Materials claims and other expenses were all down year-over-year.\nTurning now to Slide 20. Taking a look at the rest of the P&L below op income, you will see that other income of $21 million is unfavorable year-over-year by $22 million, due in part to lower net returns from company-owned life insurance, but also fewer gains on the dispositions of nonoperating properties. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was in our expected range at 23% and similar to last year. Net income increased 13%, while earnings per share grew by 18% supported by 3.3 million shares we repurchased in the quarter.\nTurning to full year highlights on Slide 21. As a reminder, these highlights are compared to adjusted results for 2020, which excludes both the noncash charge for locomotive rationalization in 1Q and the impairment charge in 3Q. Increased demand across all markets and strong results through yield up resulted in 14% year-over-year revenue improvement. Expenses increased at less than half that rate, up 6% compared to 2020 as we continued our operational transformation while responding to market changes. We produced record operating income of over $4.4 billion, up 28% or $961 million versus the adjusted 2020 results. And as Jim noted in his opening remarks, we brought our operating ratio down to 60.1%, a record milestone for our company. That is 430 basis points of year-over-year improvement in line with the guidance we provided.\nRounding out the results, net income increased 27%, while diluted EPS increased 31%, augmented by our strong share repurchase program, enabled a record free cash flow that we will wrap with on Slide 22. Free cash flow is a record $2.8 billion for 2021, up 30% year-over-year and we reported a strong 93% free cash flow conversion for the year. Property additions were about $100 million lower than our $1.6 billion guidance due to timing issues related to the continued supply chain disruptions. This shortfall in 2021 will carry over into 2022. The sharply higher profitability in the company in '21 allowed for an over $2 billion increase in shareholder distributions for the year. We had 2 dividend increases in 2021 and more than doubled our share repurchase spend. And I'll point out, we just increased our dividend again by $0.15 or 14% in 2022.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan.\nThank you, Mark.\nTurning to Slide 24. I will wrap up with our 2022 expectations. As you heard from Ed, based on our assessment of economic indicators, we expect markets related to manufacturing and consumer activity to drive growth. We expect total revenue to deliver upper single-digit growth with merchandise and intermodal both increasing solidly, and coal, resuming its long-term secular decline. We will develop and leverage our new TOP SPG operating plan to accelerate our service recovery and drive additional efficiency into the organization in support of Norfolk Southern and our customers' growth.\nYou'll hear a lot more about TOP SPG and our upcoming second quarter Investor Day. From an operating ratio perspective, we expect the first half of this year to look similar to the back half of 2021, with robust demand and service improvement, driving stronger performance in the second half of this year. With this positive momentum in revenue, productivity and efficiency and based on our current expense projections, we expect to achieve greater than 50 basis points of OR improvement in 2022 and we won't stop there.\nIn addition, we expect a dividend payout ratio range of 35% to 40% and capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. We anticipate using remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares. As you've heard from Cindy, Ed and Mark, we are optimistic about service, productivity and growth in the year ahead, and we'll advance productivity initiatives to attract business to Norfolk Southern more profitably than ever. We are committed to further efficiency improvements to create long-term sustained value for our customers and shareholders.\nThank you for your attention. We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?"

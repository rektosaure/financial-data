I will now turn the call over to Jeff Ettinger.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Today, we'll briefly review our Fiscal 2025 results, then shift our focus to the strategic priorities and outlook for Fiscal 2026.\nI'll begin with a few reflections on the year and our path forward. Paul will provide additional detail on key drivers from 2025, and then John will share our vision for 2026 and the actions we're taking to deliver consistent growth. I'll conclude with our Fiscal 2026 outlook before we move on to Q&A. Fiscal 2025 was a challenging year. Candidly, we fell significantly short of our earnings goal. In navigating a dynamic consumer environment, elevated input costs, and some unexpected setbacks, our bottom-line performance was disappointing. On the other hand, net sales exceeded $12 billion, representing 2% organic growth over the prior year and supported by gains across all three segments. We delivered four consecutive quarters of year-over-year organic net sales growth. This demonstrates the strength of our Protein Forward portfolio. In the retail segment, our leading brands continued to hold No. 1 or No.\n2 share positions in over 40 categories. Brands such as Jennie-O, Applegate, Wholly Guacamole, and SPAM contributed strong growth for the year. Importantly, the Planters brand grew net sales year-over-year, despite first-half pressures arising from last year's production disruption. Collectively, these brands represent a wide range of consumer preferences, diverse value propositions, and eating occasions. Profitability was pressured across the retail segment, and this decline is reflected in our segment margins. Input cost pressures, driven primarily by heightened commodity costs, had a challenging impact across our broad retail portfolio in 2025. The foodservice segment continued to outperform the broader industry by leveraging our direct sales team, operator-driven innovation, and diverse channel presence. Our top-line strength was wide-ranging across many brands and categories, including the Jennie-O portfolio, Fire Braised meats,Café H globally inspired proteins, branded pepperoni, and branded bacon.\nThese products all showcase the premium, protein-centric offerings that operators desire. The broader industry, however, experienced traffic declines and did not grow as expected. This, coupled with higher input costs, tempered the foodservice segment's 2025 results. The international segment's results highlight the importance of having a balanced portfolio, as some geographies outperformed while others lagged. Our China business was the biggest contributor to the international segment's top-line performance in Fiscal 2025, and it achieved strong bottom-line performance as well. Our branded export business saw strong top-line performance, though commodity input costs and trade disruptions weighed on profits. The Brazil market was a challenge for us this year and negatively impacted the international segment's ability to deliver on our growth objectives. At the total company level, our Transform and Modernize initiative played a critical role in offsetting a portion of the margin pressures we faced in 2025.\nWe advanced many strategic pathways under the program, including expanding our distribution network, closing or reallocating product from multiple facilities, and advancing our data and process maturity. Much of the work we completed is laying the foundation for growth in future years. Late in Fiscal 2025, we completed an extensive review of all administrative expenses. We made the decision to reduce some of our corporate positions and layers within the organization. This effort resulted in the reduction of approximately 250 corporate and sales positions, representing around 9% of this group. We also addressed the ongoing costs and benefits by making changes to certain programs. While these decisions are never easy, we believe these actions were both needed and responsible. We will also take the opportunity to allocate some savings from this work to reinvest in other areas, such as new capabilities and enhanced support of our growing brands.\nWe believe we are coming out of Fiscal 2025 with a conviction to win and in a position to grow. Paul Kuehneman will now provide a deeper look at our full year and Q4 financial performance. But first, I'd like to introduce Paul to our investor community and congratulate him on his new position. Paul stepped into the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer on October 27, and he brings more than 30 years of experience at Hormel Foods, including his ongoing role as Corporate Controller. He is a deeply respected leader with a strong command of our business. I am confident you'll find Paul's insights valuable, and I look forward to you engaging with him more closely. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul Kuehneman\n\nInterim CFO, Hormel Foods\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm looking forward to connecting with many of you over the coming months.\nLet's take a closer look at our results. As Jeff mentioned, net sales exceeded $12 billion for the full year of Fiscal 2025. Top-line strength continued in the Q4 as total company organic net sales grew 2% compared to the prior year. Profit was challenged this year, and value-added growth was more than offset by year-over-year margin pressures related to higher commodity input costs, supply chain impacts of avian illnesses, and some discrete items, each of which I'll dive deeper into. As previously shared, persistent inflation in key commodity inputs exceeded our expectations and remained elevated compared to prior year levels. Specifically, we experienced over 500 basis points of raw material cost inflation during the Q4 alone. For the Fiscal year, pork bellies increased approximately 25%, the pork cutout rose about 10%, and pork trim increased approximately 20%. Beef remained a significant inflationary pressure across the industry throughout the year.\nWith respect to turkey, as you'll recall, early in Fiscal 2025, we were impacted by avian illnesses across our turkey supply chain and the broader industry. Decreasing turkey supply in the industry had the compounding impact of higher commodity prices. In the Q4, we saw the return of HPAI cases, especially across the Midwest. Collectively, these developments caused challenges during Fiscal 2025, and we anticipate continued turkey supply constraints through H1 2026. As we previously discussed, we took pricing actions at various times during Fiscal 2025. However, due to the timing of some cost inflation, we cannot fully offset the margin impacts within the Fiscal year. In addition, two unfortunate events took place during the Q4: a chicken product recall and a fire at a Little Rock facility. Taken together, these events represented approximately 3% of negative EPS impacts in Fiscal 2025.\nThe benefits from our Transform and Modernize initiative helped to offset some of these margin pressures in Fiscal 2025. We ended the year having delivered benefits within our stated range and are proud of the capabilities this growth initiative has generated for our company. As we moved to SG&A, marketing and advertising spend was lower compared to last year. This was a decision to prioritize efficiency in a challenging cost environment. Importantly, although we reduced spending, we remained focused on leveraging more targeted programs to support our brands. Other adjusted SG&A expenses increased during the year, driven in part by higher employee and external expenses. As we previewed in our Q4 business update, we recorded non-cash impairment charges in both our international and retail segments as part of our year-end financial closing process.\nThe international impairment totaled $164 million and was related to a minority investment in Indonesia, an investment that remains both valuable and strategically important to us. Our retail segment impairments were $71 million, primarily related to our snack nuts business. We remain confident that our investment thesis is intact, and we are still excited about the snack nuts category and the protein diversification within our portfolio. Operating income for Fiscal 2025 was $719 million, and adjusted operating income was just over $1 billion. Operating margin was 5.9%, and adjusted operating margin was 8.4%. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2025 was 28%, which was impacted by our Q4 minority investment impairment. For the full year, diluted EPS was $0.87, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.37. For the Q4, we recognized a diluted loss per share of $0.10. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.32.\nWe recognize these results are well below our initial expectations for the year, but as Jeff mentioned, we have laid a solid foundation for a return to growth in Fiscal 2026. I'd like to touch on a few other financial priorities for the Fiscal year. We closed the year in a strong financial position with ample liquidity and a conservative level of debt. Cash flow from operations was $845 million in Fiscal 2025, and inventories at Fiscal year-end were $1.7 billion, an increase of $171 million from the beginning of the year. Capital expenditures were $311 million in Fiscal 2025. We invested in high-priority businesses with capacity expansions Hormel Fire Braised and Applegate products. Our investments also advanced data and technology, people safety, and animal welfare. Finally, we invested capital in our Jiaxing China facility to support growth.\nIn Fiscal 2025, we returned a record $633 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends, including our 389th consecutive quarterly dividend. We recently announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 1%, raising the implied annualized rate to $1.17 per share for Fiscal 2026, making Hormel Foods one of the distinguished Dividend Aristocrats with 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. Finally, this year marked our second safest year on record, following a historic achievement in 2024. I'm incredibly proud of our team members for their commitment to people safety, keeping it front and center every day, and making it a core part of how we operate. With that, more detailed context on our results, I'll turn the call over to John to walk through our strategic focus areas for Fiscal 2026.\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nThank you, Paul. In Fiscal 2025, our protein-centric portfolio demonstrated strength with consumers.\nWe leave the year ready to build off our top-line momentum by leaning into our portfolio of winning brands and products. Protein demand isn't a passing trend. It's a sustained, growing priority for so many different consumer groups. Hormel Foods is excited to lead the way, delivering real protein solutions for everyday occasions. As we turn the page to 2026, we have every reason to be confident. We are focused on winning in attractive consumption spaces by positioning our brands and innovation where they have the most significant opportunities and prioritizing our resources to fuel growth. Hormel holds a truly unique position in the food industry, an advantage we've built over many years. We have a balanced protein-centric portfolio with broad capabilities to create value and win with proteins.\nThis, coupled with our extensive reach across retail and foodservice channels, provides a strategic advantage that we believe is compelling and unmatched in today's industry. We've evolved from a meat company into a consumer-focused company. But unlike other consumer food companies, we are the consumer company that wins with protein. We deliver winning protein solutions for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and every snack in between, at home or away from home, animal-based or plant-based, whether you're cooking or someone's cooking for you. Hormel is ready to provide great tasting solutions aligned with some of the most enduring consumer trends in the food industry: ease and convenience, flavor experiences, and the growing desire for more protein. Today, I'll share three focus areas that will guide us in 2026. The first focus is consumer obsession.\nWe already have a strong foundational understanding of our consumers and operators, but in 2026, we are taking that a step further. We are actively listening, learning, and anticipating to better understand the challenges and aspirations of our consumers and operators, all so we can better design solutions and experiences that uniquely meet and even exceed their needs for food occasions. We have great examples of how we have already put this framework into action. Take our bacon platform as an example. We've spent many hours in the kitchens of our consumers and operators understanding their pain points. We uncovered a clear insight: people love bacon and want to consume it more often, but they want it to be as effortless as possible to prepare. This insight led us to innovations that make bacon easy in any kitchen. In operators' kitchens, we've brought them our high-quality, quick-prep Bacon 1 platform.\nNow we are introducing the next generation of easy for our operator partners with pre-cooked and pre-portioned sandwich-ready bacon. In the home kitchen, we've climbed to the number one position in the convenient bacon category through our pre-portioned, ready-to-heat, microwave-ready platform. We are now building distribution on the next iteration of making bacon easy at home with our oven-ready bacon platform, an innovation that all but eliminates the cleanup with a disposable oven tray. Grounded in real consumer insights, we're making sure bacon is accessible and easy for all. Through deep engagement with consumers, we've uncovered another key challenge: finding better-for-you, convenient, and versatile meal options is harder than it should be. We've listened closely to those who struggle with this tension. As leaders in protein, we have been able to provide a range of easy meal solutions made possible by our leading portfolio in ground turkey.\nOur Jennie-O marketing program presents and offers varied meal solutions that are rooted in meeting consumers' mealtime needs for lean, satisfying protein options that are easy to plug into daily life. And we see plenty of opportunities to do even more to aid consumers during mealtimes with our leading Jennie-O brand and relevant turkey products in the future. These successes show how our consumer obsession can drive real marketplace leadership, and this is only the beginning. Throughout the year, you can expect to see these insights come to life in bold, tangible ways as we continue to execute and accelerate growth by looking at the world through the eyes of our consumers and operators. Building on these consumer insights, our second focus is taking our brands beyond boundaries by breaking out of their traditional categories and unlocking new growth.\nWe are stretching our brands to their full potential by leveraging their protein advantage and unlocking big, wide-open marketplace opportunities. Protein can play an even broader role throughout the day, across different occasions and channels, and we are stepping into these growth opportunities with our protein-centric portfolio. Take our SPAM brand as an example. Our team saw an opportunity to take SPAM into new formats beyond the can. Inspired by global food culture, we reimagined new occasions for the brand, introducing a sushi-style format, now featured in sushi departments nationwide. This innovation taps into new consumers sourcing from the large and growing sushi category. SPAM's success in this product format isn't just a domestic success. By the end of Fiscal 2025, over 100 million SPAM Musubis had been sold in Japan alone, an incredible milestone made just three years after the launch.\nChicken is another attractive growth space with increasing consumer opportunity. As a protein-centric consumer company, we are thinking bigger. Our innovative mindset and strong, extendable brands allow us to follow consumer demand and deliver the experiences they crave. For Applegate, that means leveraging chicken to penetrate on-trend categories like quick-prep breakfast and easy dinner with better-for-you options such as frozen chicken breakfast sausage and lightly breaded chicken tenders for later in the day. In foodservice, we're building on the success of our Flash 180 platform. Beyond the chicken breast, we're tapping into the growing demand for chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches by providing operators with a customizable solution that simplifies their back-of-the-house operations. These moves show how we're not just following trends. We're fueling them, expanding our reach, and unlocking new growth opportunities.\nThe third focus is becoming future-ready, rooted in some basic principles so we can focus on our company premise: nourishing protein solutions. We are simplifying our company, and we are renovating ourselves. Portfolio reshaping is a priority. We are focused on strategic categories and brands with long-term growth potential and have made deliberate decisions to simplify. We recently announced plans to move the Justin's business into a strategic partnership to enable its best path forward. We also recently exited certain private label product lines, and we announced the closure of a non-strategic soup stock operation to simplify our supply chain. For internal renovation, we are committed to advancing our data, technology, people, and processes. One exciting example is how we are utilizing AI to accelerate and improve our marketing.\nFor Skippy, our team leveraged generative AI to create over 25 high-quality, seasonally relevant pieces of content in a single day, a game changer for creating impactful content at scale. These assets are now powering engagement through the critical holiday season. This is only the beginning of how we're leveraging AI to boost efficiency and unlock creativity across our brands. Beyond marketing and innovation, we're implementing AI-enabled tools like o9 and streamlined processes such as integrated business planning, transforming how we plan and make decisions every day. Enhanced data access, cutting-edge technology, and modernized workflows are reinventing nearly every aspect of our business across all aspects of our supply chain to cross-functional collaboration and all the way to the physical and digital shelf. This includes new tools leveraging data and analytics for areas such as pricing, revenue growth management, real-time portfolio management, and assortment optimization decisions.\nThe focus areas I described are underway now, though we understand our efforts must translate to margin expansion and sustainable profitable growth. We believe this strategic path sets us apart in the marketplace. By better meeting the needs of our consumers and operators with our unique and potent protein-centric portfolio, we have the opportunity to deliver consistent, profitable growth. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff to click into our 2026 outlook and assumptions.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nWe said on our third quarter call that our goal is to return to the algorithm of 2%-3 organic net sales growth and 5%-7% operating income growth. These goals are intentionally ambitious but are grounded in the strength of our portfolio and take the broader food industry environment into consideration. We are providing Fiscal 2026 guidance with a slightly wider range than our growth algorithm.\nThis approach accounts for the dynamic current environment and supports our flexibility to navigate near-term volatility while remaining firmly focused on the strategic priorities John just outlined. Let's turn now to our guidance and the key assumptions behind it. In Fiscal 2026, we expect organic net sales growth of 1%-%4. As John discussed, we think our protein-centric portfolio, coupled with our demonstrated strength and presence in both retail and foodservice, puts us in an advantaged strategic position going forward. We already saw momentum on the top line in Fiscal 2025 and plan to build on this momentum in Fiscal 2026 through enhanced marketing support. In fact, a number of these campaigns are already underway as the holidays are a key season for many of our strategic brands. Our guidance also accounts for pricing actions across our portfolio.\nThe steep increases in input costs in the summer and fall of 2025 precipitated two waves of pricing actions on many products, and the realization of the second wave will allow us to restore more balance with these inflated costs. In Fiscal 2026, we expect adjusted operating income growth of 4%-%10 and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.43-$1.51 per share. Regarding key input cost assumptions in our outlook, we expect pork input costs to decline compared to Fiscal 2025 but still remain above the five-year average. Beef costs remain high and are expected to be a headwind throughout Fiscal 2026, and nut costs are anticipated to be elevated from the prior year as well. We also expect to see stronger turkey markets in Fiscal 2026.\nGrowth margin expansion is expected to be driven by a variety of levers, including mix improvements, the wraparound pricing benefits that I just mentioned, and productivity from our Transform and Modernize initiative. I want to be clear about our intentions with regard to the Transform and Modernize initiative. Our efforts will continue in Fiscal 2026. However, we do not plan to report T&M savings separately going forward. We believe its financial benefits will be spread in supporting our enhanced marketing programs, offsetting some of the continued inflationary pressure, and allowing us to expand margins. And this is all accounted for in the range of our guidance. Regarding SG&A, as I shared in my opening remarks, our recently announced corporate restructuring designed to support strategic priorities and long-term growth is expected to result in savings in non-advertising spending in Fiscal 2026.\nWe expect each of our segments to deliver both top line and segment profit growth in Fiscal 2026. For further segment guidance information, please refer to our supplemental slides on our investor relations website. From a cadence standpoint, we expect Q1 earnings to decline compared to prior year, mainly due to timing of the impacts of pricing, commodity input costs, and some lingering impacts from our fourth quarter. We believe our full-year guidance range is achievable and realistic. It demonstrates the value of our balanced protein-centric portfolio and positions us for sustainable long-term growth. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A portion of the call, and we look forward to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star followed by the number one on your touch-tone phone.\nYou will hear a prompt that your hand has been raised. If you would like to withdraw from the polling process, please press star, then the number two. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure to lift your handset before pressing any keys. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning. You touched on some of the cost expectations and how the T&M initiatives would be continuing and some of the other administrative savings. But could you maybe just unpack guidance a little bit further and give us some of the key puts and takes to keep in mind and just how to think about peeling that onion a little bit further?\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nSure, Michael. Thank you very much. This is Jeff Ettinger answering.\nSo we'll start on the top line where we said we expect organic net sales growth of 1%-4%. We already have substantial momentum on top line, and with all four quarters last year generating top line growth and driven by all three segments, we expect that kind of momentum to continue. As John described, we think our protein-centric portfolio, coupled with our presence in both retail and foodservice, puts us in an advantaged strategic position. In terms of other specifics that will help the top line in Fiscal 2026, we'll be benefiting from the pricing actions that have already been taken place, but some of which kind of roll in in Q1 or at the very beginning of Q2. And then we also will have enhanced marketing support, and we've been on air already supporting many of our key brands.\nWhen it comes to the bottom line, we've guided to adjusted operating income growth of 4%-10 with a midpoint of 7% growth in Fiscal 2026. We have taken several steps to help our bottom line performance catch up with our top line momentum. So first of all, there is that pricing flow through, which will better match up with costs as the year goes on. Secondly, we expect to drive mix improvement, and the marketing focus will help us to do that. Third, we do expect continued benefits from the T&M program. Fourth, we have the savings from the restructuring work, and I'm sure we'll be able to provide more details about that, and further questions on the call here this morning.\nAnd then lastly, we do expect some relief from pork costs, particularly in the second half of the year, although we're still facing some headwinds in beef and nut costs. So overall, I mean, I guess our theme is we believe our guidance is realistic and achievable and demonstrates the value of our balanced protein-centric portfolio.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThat's helpful. Great color. And could I just add a follow-up on portfolio reshaping you touched on in the prepared remarks and gave a couple of examples? It sounds like, is that more of a starting point in that you would be doing a bit more review there? Or how would you sort of assess maybe some of what you've just announced versus what may still be to come?\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nHi, Michael. This is John. I'll take that question. So thank you. Yep.\nPortfolio reshaping certainly is an ongoing effort for us, and it's a strategic one. We continue to look at strategic categories and brands and making sure we're building our portfolio around our growth ambitions. Also importantly, looking at how do we simplify our operations. Really, all of it is about positioning Hormel for sustainable long-term growth. If you think about simplifying operations, that includes exiting non-strategic businesses and ensuring we have the best owner for our brands and product lines. The example I mentioned earlier around Justin's, Justin's is a wonderful brand, but a better fit in the hands of the strategic partnership that we've created. Given its overall size, the opportunity it has for growth in confections, which is a non-strategic category for us, was an opportunity that we saw.\nSo I would say overall, our actions reflect a deliberate strategy around portfolio shaping, all intended to streamline and position our company for sustainable, profitable growth and allowing us to really focus on that premise I mentioned, which is nourishing protein solutions.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, great. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Thomas Palmer from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Palmer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGood morning and thanks for the question. Jeff, in the prepared remarks, you said you expect stronger turkey markets in your guidance. I just wanted to clarify around that since there are several turkey products you sell, including ground turkey, where there was some pricing mid-year and then deli meat. What are you assuming in the outlook for whole bird pricing? Spot price is obviously up quite a bit, but I think you still have contracting to finalize over the coming quarter.\nSo I think at times you guys have indicated it might be too early to embed much change in guidance until you start to capture it in contracts. Thanks.\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nOkay. So this is John. Tom, I'll jump in on that one. I'll just talk turkey a little bit. I'll kind of pull back overall on turkey in general for us and kind of come down to some of the areas you're touching on. So first, turkey continues to be a very important business for us, very important for the consumer. And in particular, our focus around value-added turkey, ground turkey continues to be a winning formula for us. From a consumer demand standpoint, ground turkey in particular is a great option for consumers. Very versatile, plugs in very well to everyday life, different food experiences, different meal experiences.\nSo in terms of creating value in a strained consumer environment, we love our ground turkey business. Second, I'll comment that there certainly has been some volatility in the markets and the industry. You'll recall that in 2025, we saw a run-up in costs in the first half of the year around turkey. In our supply chain, we said we needed to take price. We did that. We implemented pricing actions in the back half based on that inflation that we saw. We actually weathered that pricing well on our ground turkey business, driving both top line growth, market share improvements, and profit recovery. So we're managing the volatility well. I would say coming from a position of strength with Jennie-O as we support the brand well, serve our customers well is absolutely critical. That being said, the markets have continued to fluctuate. Certainly, that does impact our pricing.\nAnd coming to your point around whole birds in particular, I would say our guidance or expectations for the year include somewhat elevated whole bird prices throughout the year. Although I will point out to your question, it's early and very little is settled at this point in terms of the market. We still need to see sell-through from this holiday season as one factor in that. So that's the position of where we're at now. And again, from an overall standpoint, we love the turkey business. Consumers looking for lean protein. Our ground turkey business continues to be a winning business for us that we're going to drive.\n\nThomas Palmer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for that. And then maybe this question will catch you off guard, but I wonder if you might share a bit of the expected savings from your restructuring work.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah. Hi, this is Jeff.\nI didn't answer your last question, so I owe you this one, right? So as we talked about, we made the difficult but responsible decision to reduce expenses, ultimately resulting in a 250-position workforce reduction, which is about 9% of our corporate and sales group. Significantly, the other aspect of this that we focused on was really making sure we had the right organizational structure going forward. We were able to reduce layers in many areas, and we also targeted expenses, including certain benefit programs. This work has resulted in meaningful savings and will free up capacity for growth objectives and our company initiatives. We designed the program to deliver gross savings in the range of two to three times our expected cost to implement.\nAnd we expect that the payback timing will be quick within the first 12 months, although in terms of quarterly cadence, it doesn't really kick into the beginning of the calendar year. So the first two periods of Q1 really don't have this benefit. I also want to point out that you won't see all of this flow through as a direct reduction in SG&A because some of these gross savings are being reinvested in people, brands, and technology. Some of the benefit actually gets reflected in cost of goods instead of SG&A, and some will cover incentive resets. Let me also pass over to Paul to give you a little more specific for modeling purposes.\n\nThomas Palmer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah. Great. Thanks, Jeff.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nAll in, the work we've done for SG&A has allowed us to anticipate adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales comparable to the prior year, inclusive of meaningful step-up in marketing and advertising investments. Maintaining prior year rates of spending while reallocating resources to what will drive our brands and company forward in the best way is an important lever to our growth story for Fiscal 2026 and beyond.\n\nThomas Palmer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for the details.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please ask your question.\n\nBen Theurer\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nYeah. Good morning, and thank you very much for taking my question. A lot to digest, literally, but I wanted to go back into some of the comments and the outlook more particular as it relates to Planters.\nSo obviously, you've taken some decisions within the nut business on the private label side, but just want to understand where you are in terms of the journey of recovering on Planters of what you've lost in terms of where are you in shelf space, where are you on the profit side, just to understand how we should think about the cadence into Fiscal 2026 of further delivering from the Planters business. That would be my first question.\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nGreat. Great, Ben. Good morning. I'll take it. It's John. Yeah. Planters continues to be a very important brand for us in our portfolio, and we are very bullish overall on Planters going forward. Last quarter, I mentioned that we had started growing Planters again, and now I am very pleased to say that we are fully back in growth mode behind Planters.\nI mean that both in the near term as well as in the potential we see for Planters in the longer term. So when I talk about the near term, we are clearly delivering the gains we expected to see in the marketplace. I'm pleased to report that in the latest 13 weeks of consumption data, we've seen Planters plus 12% in dollar consumption and plus 6% in volume consumption versus prior year. This is largely, to your point, driven by distribution gains. Distribution is up 13% versus prior year in the latest 13 weeks, and base sales are up over 10%. So the specific question around distribution, our distribution recovery is just about complete at this point. We are nearly all the way back to where we were prior to the supply disruption, and we are gaining share in the growing snacking category.\nI also mentioned last quarter that our top line momentum is good. Our consumer recovery is on track, but our profit recovery has been somewhat hampered. That continues primarily driven by mix shifts related to consumers trading out of cashews. You may recall that last year, cashews saw significant price increases that were precipitated by commodity inflation. We love the fact that we have a brand and an equity with the Planters franchise that's big enough to keep all those consumers in the franchise as they trade among nut types, but that does drive some mix implications for us from a profitability standpoint. So as we go forward, we'll continue to build on that top line momentum. We are going to begin lapping that cashew pricing in Q2 2026.\nAnd we are adjusting our go-to-market plans to take advantage of our broad portfolio to drive more favorable mix. And we continue to focus on our three-part plan that we've talked about before, attracting consumers to the brand, stepped-up communications and advertising, strong in-store promotions, increased focus on our exciting innovation that's proven to be highly incremental to the brand and the category. And we just continue to love Planters as a snacking platform. As consumers are migrating to snacks with substance, snacks with protein, we love the fact that we have this leading brand in that space.\n\nBen Theurer\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. Perfect. And then second, I mean, obviously, you've done a lot. We had some impairment charges within your international business, which you've highlighted was Indonesia-related. But within international, you called out the dynamics in Brazil, the challenges down there. So we know it was a venture.\nIt was a relatively small business. But given some of the initiatives you're doing in terms of portfolio review, we've seen the Justin's thing. I mean, there is a lot just going on. So how should we think about the venture in Brazil? Is that still part of you want to be there, or is that something you would be open to put up for sale to literally have an even cleaner story maybe on the international business with more of a focus in Southeast Asia, Asia, and not so much with the venture as well in Brazil that has been causing, I guess, more headache than smiles? So just your takes on Brazil, that would be appreciated.\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah. Sure, Ben. John, I'll take that one too. Look, I would say just a couple of general comments about our international business.\nNumber one, our China business does continue to perform very well for us. That is a strategic priority. It's a focus. Two, we have seen good success on our branded export business, headlined by Global SPAM. That continues to do very well for us. To the questions around what's held us back, certainly, there are parts of the export business in terms of more commodity-type products that have been more of a struggle recently. And then Brazil, for sure, has been a drag in terms of our overall performance. To come to your question around portfolio, certainly, my earlier comments were everything is under review. We do continue to look at our portfolio in total for what makes sense, what doesn't, and we'll continue that process as we go through 2026. Thank you.\n\nBen Theurer\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research.Please go ahead.\n\nHeather Jones\n\nFounder, Heather Jones Research\n\nGood morning. Thanks for the questions. I guess I wanted to start with the assumptions on raw material input cost, specifically pork. So it seems like the recovery and productivity for the industry from disease is trending above expectations, and we're set up for decent supply growth in 2026. So I was just trying to get a sense of, you said above the five-year average, but below 2025. But I was just wondering if you could give us a little more detail as far as how you're thinking about the year-on-year decline in raw materials, particularly given how much bellies and trim have already retrenched from the summer highs.\n\nPaul Kuehneman\n\nInterim CFO, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah. Thanks, Heather. This is Paul. As the first quarter has begun, pork, trim, and beef remain at a headwind year-over-year, like you mentioned. We have started to see some year-over-year relief in bellies.\nWe have announced also targeting price and actions to address the markets. In foodservice, there's no changes to our pricing. We do have beef and nut headwinds as we look at the full year of Fiscal 2026 in our guidance. Then to your point, improving pork benefits in H2 is kind of what we've modeled internally.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nIf I could add, Heather, this is Jeff. Just kind of further response to your question. There's modeling for the whole year that obviously we need to do. But one of the things I think we've realized over the last three to four months is we really need to be more real-time responsive to changes in markets. So in response to this heightened market volatility, we're refining some of our processes to drive greater agility in forecasting and managing commodity risk.\nOne example would be we're going to couple our external forecasting sources with some of our real-time internal knowledge about factors affecting the commodity market. So we can predict what we think will happen in H2 and how much recovery there is, but we need to be better at then reacting to what really goes on.\n\nHeather Jones\n\nFounder, Heather Jones Research\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. My second question is just you have a number of tailwinds going into 2026, whether it be potentially lower raw material costs in pork, the turkey markets, the lapping of non-recurring things. And you mentioned the headwinds of beef and nuts, and you're going to raise your advertising spend. But just wondering, as you were putting together your guidance and all, just if you could give us a sense of how much the consumer environment factored into your outlook.\nAre you assuming a still tough consumer all the way through 2026? Or just how are you thinking about foodservice traffic? And I know that's a really big question, but just trying to get a better sense on how you're thinking about demand.\n\nPaul Kuehneman\n\nInterim CFO, Hormel Foods\n\nWell, it's so big, Heather. It's going to take two of us to answer. It's all starting with Jeff and then John. John will talk about the consumer. I do want to give a little more color to all of you on the call today about cadence. So we do expect Q1 earnings to be pressured still compared to last year. And we're actually looking at probably $0.02-$0.04 below year ago as a realistic range because we still have spillover effects on the bottom line in terms of the pricing actions. They're not all fully implemented in Q1.\nIn terms of the commodity input costs, as you correctly point out, they've started to come down, but they do remain elevated. We have some turkey supply issues still from the turkey illness issues. As I mentioned a minute ago, we have the timing of the SG&A benefit, which will help us through the year, but not particularly in Q1. So although we expect Q1 earnings to be pressured compared to last year, we then are confident in our growth guide for the remainder of the year, but it does pull down the full year in terms of how that factors in. On the consumer side, John?\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah. So thanks, Heather. I'll talk a little bit. I mean, I think the consumer environment, I would still say the consumer is quite strained, feeling the cumulative effects of inflation, feeling some of the uncertainty in the macro environment.\nConsumer sentiment remains quite low. So as we look out to 2026, I mean, we are factoring that into our guidance, meaning we expect the consumer to continue to exhibit value-seeking behavior throughout the year. We believe our portfolio is well-positioned to provide value in a number of different ways. From a foodservice perspective, aligned with external forecasts, we expect flat to little growth in the foodservice industry in total. But again, we love our solutions-based portfolio. We love our foodservice model in terms of the channel diversification we have across small and large, across different types of channels, across commercial and non-commercial. So we love our channel resilience. We love our direct sales force. We love the types of solutions we provide to operators who value our partnership, even in difficult times when traffic is down.\nSo we feel like we have a good set of answers to the challenging environment, but we are modeled and forecasting a continued difficult environment from a consumer standpoint throughout 2026.\n\nHeather Jones\n\nFounder, Heather Jones Research\n\nVery helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Pooran Sharma from Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nPooran Sharma\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stephens\n\nThanks for the question. I was just wondering if maybe you could give us a sense of kind of how much you're planning to invest back in the business. I know in terms of T&M, and I know you're walking away from giving T&M targets going forward, but what you had given in the past was $75 million in FY2024 and then $100 million-$150 million in FY2025.\nI was just wondering if you were able to give us a sense of how much of that you were planning to invest back into the business, or just give us a sense of how much reinvestment you're planning to drive back into the business.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Pooran. I think, again, this is Jeff, and I'll start, and John will conclude on your question. So I do want to point out on T&M, so this is the final year of our current program. It doesn't mean we've made any permanent decisions about where we go from here. It really has played a critical role and delivered significant value to the company. We have continued efforts scheduled for this year, a number of specific projects.\nBut we have found that breaking out the financial benefits separately seems like it hasn't been particularly helpful, and in some cases, has caused confusion. So we're not providing that breakout, but we do expect to see financial benefits in 2026, and they'll kind of be spread between the marketing enhancement that you're asking about. We're also going to use some to offset continued inflationary pressure, and then hopefully to allow us to expand margins. I'll hand it over to John then.\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah. Good morning, Pooran. So in terms of how we're thinking about that reinvestment behind our brands, we're spending largely in a concentrated way behind our focus brands. There's a couple of points to that. One is think about our brands like Planters, SPAM, Jennie-O, as well as critical innovation that we know is important in the market to deliver that value for consumers right now.\nDriving our investments behind those brands is one of the levers we have to drive positive mix into 2026 and create some of that margin momentum. Second, I will say on those businesses, we do have a very good handle and analytics around return on investment behind those marketing investments. And most importantly at this moment is it's absolutely critical that we support our brands through the pricing. We know that the consumer is strained. We know that we've taken multiple waves of pricing that we've talked about. It's inflation-justified pricing. It's needed, but the consumer is strained. And so our ability to support our brands well through those pricing actions is actually, for us, proven to be the recipe for success, to successfully implement those pricing actions and to be able to continue the category and brand momentum we want to see.\nSo that's how we're thinking about our stepped-up investment into 2026.\n\nPooran Sharma\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stephens",
    "content2": "Great. Great. Appreciate the color there. On the follow-up, I was maybe just hoping to dive into cadence just a tad bit further. Appreciate the color you just gave on Q1. Just thinking about Q2 through Q4 and the recovery in FY 2026, is it more of a gradual recovery where you're going to see a sequential recovery quarter to quarter from Q2-Q4, or is it more of kind of a step-up in the back half and just a little bit of recovery in Q2? If you're able to just provide any color around that, it would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nSure. Thanks, Pooran. This is Jeff again. Yeah. We do expect after the first quarter challenges to see an acceleration of benefit.\nRealistically, as you get to Q4, you're now against a quarter that, as we talked about, had $0.03 of one-time incidents. And so that clearly should be a more beneficial quarter. So the middle ones will be more modest increases, and then Q4 should be more substantial.\n\nPooran Sharma\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stephens\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Leah Jordan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nLeah Jordan\n\nResearch Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. I just wanted to go back and dig in a little bit more on Heather's second question, given the fact that you're planning for revenue growth in each of your segments next year. Just seeing if you could talk more about the drivers between price and volume for each segment.\nI mean, we've got some pricing in retail, but there's maybe some lower costs that will come through in the back half, and we've got the quicker pass-through on foodservice. So just how should we think about those elements in the mix of a more challenged consumer environment?\n\nPaul Kuehneman\n\nInterim CFO, Hormel Foods\n\nHey, good morning, Leah. This is Paul. So on the segment detail guide, all in for Fiscal 2026, we expect retail to have modest declines in volume with low single-digit increases in net sales. foodservice will have low single-digit increases in volume with net sales in the mid-single digits. And then international, also expecting low single-digit increases in volume with high single-digit increases in net sales. And as Jeff has stated, segment profit growth by all three segments for the course of the year.\n\nLeah Jordan\n\nResearch Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\nAnd then maybe just some comments around the competitive overall across your categories in retail. I mean, what are you seeing from peers as you start to put through some targeted pricing in some areas? But you're also kind of planning for incremental brand investments as well. So just the competitive environment overall. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah, sure. I can take that. This is John. Good morning, Leah. So from a retail perspective, we do feel very good about the top-line momentum we're seeing across the retail business, despite what is a choppy and competitive environment and that strained consumer backdrop. When you look at the drivers underneath that consumption performance, you can see in the scanner data, our flagship and rising brands continue to perform well. In the latest 13 weeks, they were up 3.7% versus last year.\nThat carried our total core melt portfolio to over 1% consumption growth in the latest 13 weeks. Some of the standout performers, Jennie-O ground turkey, where we're up double digits, we're certainly pacing ahead of the competition. Planters, back to double-digit growth, also pacing ahead of the competition. We're seeing good, strong growth in our rising Mexican brands. Wholly Guacamole and Herdez grew 7% and 5%, respectively. Applegate continues to grow. So we like our portfolio. We like the momentum we have on retail. We have taken, as we've talked about, multiple waves of pricing action. In the last quarter call, we talked about that we had announced a wave of pricing that we were going to monitor if we needed additional pricing.\nAs we got deeper into the quarter and saw the markets continue to rise, we did, in fact, announce another wave of pricing, which largely will benefit us in the second quarter. To your point around how do we maintain that momentum, how do we feel competitively? We're going to continue to invest in our brands. We're going to continue to invest behind our core brands as well as our innovation to weather that competitively. And all in all, we certainly see competitive activity in some of the categories that is aggressive, but we feel like we have good differentiated positions. We know where our growth is needed to come from, and we're going to continue to invest in those spots.\n\nLeah Jordan\n\nResearch Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Max Gumport from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\nMax Gumport\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nHey, thanks for the question.\nI was hoping for an update on tariffs, particularly if there are any expenses, particularly such as those associated with cashews that you incurred in FY 2025 that might not repeat in FY 2026 due to recent exemptions. And then if so, if you could quantify that impact for us.\n\nPaul Kuehneman\n\nInterim CFO, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah, Max, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. Overall, a message on tariffs, really, we feel that we're fairly insulated. Obviously, the global environment remains dynamic, and it's ever-changing. For 2026, the range that we think that we'll have on tariffs is $25 million-$35 million, and it's mainly related to supplies, steel, and aluminum. Obviously, we were watching cashews until the recent announcements of the removal of reciprocal tariffs. We haven't really quantified that exact amount that we had in 2025 to give you a range on the 2026 question.\n\nMax Gumport\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nOkay.\nI think that 25 to 35, is that roughly aligned with the total tariffs that you saw on your P&L in 2025, though? I think you had quantified a $0.01-$0.02 impact, I believe, in H2 2025.\n\nPaul Kuehneman\n\nInterim CFO, Hormel Foods\n\nYep. So for a full-year basis, that is correct.\n\nMax Gumport\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nOkay. Great. Then that takes me to my second question, which would be, I mean, I feel like there's plenty of discrete items you have in Fiscal year 2026 that will be a help to your profit growth. So you've mentioned admin savings. I think you said it was two to three times the cost to implement, which I think is $20 million-$25 million to cost to implement. Correct me if that's wrong, but if that's right, that would be maybe at the midpoint, roughly $60 million in savings.\nNow, all of that is going to flow to the bottom line. Some of it gets reinvested, but let's assume half flows to the bottom line. That's $30 million in profit growth. You've got the chicken recalls that you're lapping, the fire at the Little Rock facility that you're lapping. So that's another $20 million or so in profit growth. So now we're at $50 million in profit growth. Your guidance is for $40 million-$100 million. And you've also got a benefit coming from T&M, again, some of which gets reinvested, but some of which would flow to the bottom line, and then whole bird turkey pricing. So I was hoping just to get a bit more color on sort of what am I missing? What's dragging you down? Is it other forms of inflation like corned beef and nuts?\nJust given these discrete factors, I'm trying to get a better sense for what might be holding you back and sort of keeping the low end of the range at 4%. Thank you very much.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nOkay. All right. I'll start, Max. This is Jeff. I mean, you're correct that the $20 million-$25 million number in terms of the one-time cost is what we've reported. And so your math of the two to three times works in that regard. And you correctly pointed out that that ends up being the total available savings, but then we are going to be reinvesting parts of it in certain areas. I think a couple of other factors we probably could point out to you that might mitigate your math a little bit. One, I'll remind you again about Q1. So we start out the year in somewhat of a hole.\nSo the implied rest of the year is quite a bit higher than 7% then. So that does factor in some of the advantages that you're citing. Secondly, I mean, I think the other thing that maybe models miss that we've talked about in the past is in the pricing area, that while we're in a reasonably good position to be current to the cost on the foodservice side with some lag, in retail, it's a more complex decision. And there are cases where, okay, if we're, yes, the costs are up this much, but if we price to that same equivalent amount, it's going to really harm the long-term future of the brand. There are times where we've chosen not to do that. And so some of the math factoring into how we think 2026 plays out has that factored in as well. Got it.\n\nMax Gumport\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nThanks very much. Appreciate the color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nErica Eiler\n\nAssociate of Equity Research, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. This is Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into gross margins. Obviously, under pressure here in Q4 because of some of those discrete items. But maybe you could just walk us through some of the high-level puts and takes, how you're thinking about gross margins for the year, maybe in terms of cadence, how we should think about the recovery there.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nSo when you think about the gross margins for the year, I think obviously we've got in 2025, like you mentioned, we obviously had impacted by the commodity inflation with 500 basis points year over year in Q4 alone. The chicken product recall and the Little Rock fire obviously drove that as well.\nPlanters' top line is performing well, but as we said last quarter, we're balancing mixed dynamics on profitability. So those are really the margin dynamics in 2025. As we look in 2026, we obviously have got gross margin expansion with mix improvements, a lot of pricing flow through over the course of the year in different waves that John's already described on the call here. And then we've got T&M savings going forward as well in the final year of the Transform and Modernize project.\n\nErica Eiler\n\nAssociate of Equity Research, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay. Thanks for the call. And then just on inventory, so I think inventory was up about 11% in the quarter. Just curious how you're feeling about the health of your inventory from here.\n\nPaul Kuehneman\n\nInterim CFO, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah. Great question, Erica. Overall, we feel very comfortable with our inventory levels. And as you note, they are up year over year, but they actually went down in the fourth quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThe biggest driver of that increase in inventory is the commodity markets that are boosting the balances. We've made strategic decisions on pounds to increase where the center store business for the colder months and weather events. Lapping last year, we also had the Planters issue in the Suffolk plant. We've got a replenishment there. But overall, we feel very comfortable with where our inventory levels are today.\n\nErica Eiler\n\nAssociate of Equity Research, Oppenheimer\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question comes from the line of Yasmine Deswandhy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nYasmine Deswandhy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Can I just ask on turkey specifically? So we know that turkey was a $0.25 headwind to Fiscal 2023, and then roughly a $0.15 headwind to Fiscal 2024. So could you just help us bridge the 2025 impact?\nSo it was a full-year turkey headwind or tailwind to earnings in 2025?\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nSo good morning, Yasmine. Just to give you a little bit of color on turkey. So I mean, in general, we saw a lot of, I'll say, increased cost in turkey in 2025. We were able to land on our ground turkey business the pricing we needed to cover that. In terms of how that played out for the year, those first half pressures really hit us quite hard. We were able to balance that back in the second half and offset those first half headwinds with the improved results in the back half. In terms of whole birds, they did come in somewhat better than expected compared to our original outlook from Fiscal 2025. But it was obviously a very, I'll call it, volatile year on turkey.\nWe weathered it quite well from a competitive standpoint and the recovery in the back half of the year. All in, it was a benefit in 2025.\n\nYasmine Deswandhy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on raw materials inflation, you had said last earnings that I think Q3 was roughly 400 basis points. How much was it in Q4, and how should we think about it in 2026 on a quarterly basis, given there's typically some seasonality there?\n\nJohn Ghingo\n\nPresident, Hormel Foods\n\nYeah. Thanks, Yasmine, for your question. In quarter four, it was 500 basis points of raw material cost inflation during the fourth quarter. The second part of the question, I'd direct you to Jess and having more internal discussions there.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. We have no further questions at this time. So I'll turn the call back to Jeff Ettinger for closing comments.\n\nJeff Ettinger\n\nInterim CEO, Hormel Foods\n\nSir, please go ahead. Thank you very much. Since we're already running over, I just want to express my thanks to everyone for taking the time to follow us today.\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Further information about our non-GAAP financial measures including our comparability items and reconciliations are detailed in our press release, which can be accessed on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jeff Ettinger.\n\nJeffrey M. Ettinger\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Having been in my current role for just over a month, I am committed to building upon the strong foundation in place, rooted in an impressive portfolio of products iconic brands and a great culture. Since returning to the company, I have been immersed in working with our leadership team and gaining a deeper understanding of our operations and strategic priorities.\nIt is clear to see our robust solutions-based portfolio and the protein-centric nature of our offerings work well in today's consumer landscape. Further, a major focus of mine has been learning about the transform and modernize initiative, its current trajectory, the key projects underway and how the work is progressing. I've been impressed to see the solid and demonstrable benefits of the program, not just financially, but through building capabilities for the future.\nOur mission is clear: deliver profitable growth. And if we turn to this quarter's results, we are halfway there, having delivered organic net sales growth for 3 consecutive quarters. Building upon modest gains in the first and second quarters, we achieved an impressive organic net sales increase of 6% in the third quarter. What is equally notable is that this growth was broad-based, driven by all 3 of our segments. It is clearly disappointing that our top line results did not translate into the bottom line growth we expected. The unanticipated surges in commodity input costs that affected our industry absorbed not only the margin delivery from our top line growth, but also our incremental benefits from our T&M initiative.\nRegarding the fourth quarter, we expect continued net sales growth supported by our leading positions in the marketplace. To address commodity inflation, we are taking targeted pricing actions. We expect profit recovery, however, to lag into next year with the near-term pressures we experienced in the third quarter persisting through the fourth quarter. John will share more information on the progress being made in each of our segments and Jacinth will go into greater detail on the third quarter performance and our guidance for the remainder of the year.\nBut before I turn the call over to them, I wanted to align on expectations regarding what you can anticipate from us today and moving forward. In line with what the team has stated previously, we plan to share holistic 2026 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call, including the specifics around our expectations for the TNM initiative. What we will provide today is commentary related to our high-level vision for 2026, which Jacinth and I will cover later in today's call.\nBeyond the word you hear from us today, I want you all to leave with the absolute confidence that driving sustainable growth, both on the top line and the bottom line is our top priority. I am confident in the capabilities of our team and the opportunities ahead for our company. I look forward to reengaging with this investment community over the next year.\nAhead of John's remarks, I'd like to extend my congratulations on his recent appointment as the 11th President of Hormel Foods. This marks a pivotal moment for our company, as John brings a fresh and energizing approach to leadership, one that is already resonating across the organization. His ability to balance strategic clarity with a collaborative people-first approach is exactly what we need as we continue to evolve and grow. I look forward to partnering with him and I am confident we will make meaningful progress in advancing our mission over the coming year.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn F. Ghingo\n\nExecutive Vice President of Retail\n\nThank you, Jeff. I want to take a moment to congratulate you and welcome you back to the company. Many of you know Jeff already as a purpose-driven leader with a proven track record of successfully leading this company. In just a short time since his return, I've been impressed with his clarity of vision, the conviction with which he leads and the mentorship he's extended to me personally. He brings renewed energy and focus, and I'm excited to partner with them as we move forward.\nFurther, I also want to take a moment to congratulate Jim Snee on his well-deserved retirement and thank him for all he has done for our company and for me personally. Jim was a transformative leader. He had a culture-first mentality and recognize the opportunity for greater potential for our company. We launched our journey of transformation, and I look forward to carrying that work forward.\nWith that, let's jump in. In today's consumer landscape, there is a lot to be considered. Consumers are cautious, yet resilient. They have shown a willingness to spend when products and experiences meet their needs, but rising costs are forcing consumers to make trade-offs. That said, we believe the powerful combination of our protein-focused portfolio, leading positions across multiple channels and capabilities related to innovation, renovation, customer partnership, and strategic brand investment position us well to maintain the top line momentum that we've built over the last 3 quarters.\nTake our retail segment, for example, where our vision is focused, deliberate and is now in motion. We are building a consumer-led growth engine powered by protein-centric solutions that deliver meaningful value to customers and consumers. By modernizing our products to deliver category-leading differentiation, innovating bigger and bolder and taking a disciplined approach to investment and execution, our retail team is building strong brands. And I'm pleased with how these efforts are translating into results.\nIn the third quarter, our flagship and rising brands delivered 3% dollar consumption growth. And taking a closer look at those results, I am particularly encouraged by the volume-led momentum across many of these brands. In fact, many of our category-leading brands showed impressive consumer volume demand in the third quarter, including brands like Wholly Guacamole, SPAM, Black Label Bacon, Herdez, Hormel Pepperoni and Applegate to name a few. Each of these brands leveraged a personalized take on our common playbook. They started from a position of strength with consumers benefited from our ongoing renovation and innovation work which is focused on staying ahead of evolving consumer preferences and many received targeted marketing support to drive both relevance and measurable returns.\nDigging into one of these brands a bit further, the SPAM brand shows just how impactful our approach can be. Our ongoing modernization strategy for the SPAM brand delivered another strong quarter with year-over-year volume and net sales growth. We leverage the brand's iconic equity by partnering with customers on impactful summer promotions and launching a limited time offer designed to drive both volume and net sales growth, all reinforcing the SPAM brand's relevance in the marketplace.\nAnother great example of the impact of brand modernization is the launch of the Hormel Pepperoni brand renovation work. This 110-year-old brand is the #1 retail pepperoni brand, and we would like to keep it that way for another century. Our team initiated a thoughtful renovation project on the brand, and we recently unveiled a refreshed package design. This update is more than cosmetic. It's an investment with customers to bring excitement to this important category and to signal to consumers that Hormel Pepperoni is evolving with their taste and expectations. The launch is supported by our new campaign, boldly irresistible and we expect this renovation to drive stronger purchase intent, accelerate velocities and reinforce brand loyalty.\nI also want to spend a minute on our Jennie-O ground turkey business, which offers a clear illustration of how a strong brand that is well aligned with evolving consumer preferences for lean affordable protein wins in the marketplace. As we said previously, we needed to take inflation-based pricing which went into effect late Q2. Because of the strength of this brand, we were able to successfully navigate elasticities and capture dollar share and net sales growth.\nBefore I conclude my comments for the retail segment, I want to give an update on the performance of our Planters business. I am pleased to report that by the end of the quarter, scanner data was now reflecting year-over-year growth in distribution, household penetration and dollar sales. With the foundation restored, the team is back on the offense, reengaging consumers with innovations like nut duos and flavored cashews, while also launching a limited-time bar nuts variety to spark excitement around summer snacking. With the capacity in place to fulfill demand and accelerating sales momentum as we enter Q4, I am encouraged by the top line recovery of the Planters business.\nProfitability on the other hand, is being impacted by mix and inflation. We are actively working on drivers to balance the evolving needs of consumers and drive profitability. Looking ahead for retail, we expect that our brand-building playbook will enable continued strong top line performance in the fourth quarter. However, we remain cautious on segment profitability. The ramp-up of commodity markets in the third quarter has created margin pressure that will continue through the fourth quarter.\nAs Jeff shared, we are taking targeted pricing actions to help offset these pressures, which will go into effect throughout the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Our focus for retail is to build a consumer-led growth engine powered by protein-centric solutions that deliver meaningful value to customers and consumers.\nLet's now shift to our Foodservice segment. Our operators are facing a challenging environment. Industry-wide traffic has remained soft with overall visits slightly down year-over-year. Casual dining has showed relative resilience in recent months, but the broader food service industry continues to face headwinds from inflation and shifting consumer behavior. The dynamics of this environment, particularly the impact of commodity pressures in the third quarter led to margin compression for our business, but we believe that the pass-through nature of costs for much of our foodservice portfolio will allow us to recover profitability over time. As a result, we believe that underlying volume health continues to be a good measure of success for the segment. And here, our team delivered strong results in the quarter.\nOnce again, organic volume and net sales growth for the Foodservice segment outpaced broader industry results in the third quarter. Our growth was broad-based, showcasing our great solutions-based portfolio and the power of our direct selling organization. While you've heard us highlight this team often, I did want to take a moment to congratulate both the retail and foodservice selling teams for being recognized for the 24th consecutive year by selling power as one of the best companies to sell for. For food service, this is certainly a testament to the value the team delivers to their customers and operators.\nAs I said, volume and net sales growth came from many of our foodservice brands in the third quarter. Planters snack nuts, the Jennie-O Turkey portfolio and Hormel Premium Pepperoni all delivered significant growth. For a bit of insight in a highly competitive category like pepperoni, we delivered 20% year-over-year volume growth for Hormel premium pepperoni. These results highlight the team's understanding of our customers and operators needs and the quality and value of our portfolio.\nA recovery in industry traffic would certainly create a more favorable operating environment for our foodservice business, but we are not waiting for an industry recovery to return this powerful portfolio to the segment profit growth that we know it can deliver. Closing out the segments. In international, net sales growth in the third quarter was driven by our thriving China business. Overall, the China market is rebounding, and we grew our in-country business across both [indiscernible] Foodservice and retail channels this [indiscernible] and the team strategically launched Skippy comes into a new channel, further accelerating its distribution growth globally.\nBeyond China, International's exports in the third quarter also delivered positive top line results led largely by our global SPAM brand exports. Profitability was down year-over-year, mainly due to our Brazil business, which remained under significant pressure in the quarter. The operating environment in Brazil continues to be challenged by competitive pricing dynamics. Our international team remains focused on expanding our global brands and portfolio with the same mission of returning to profitable growth.\nTurning back to our performance overall in the third quarter. While our top line results were impressive, the bottom line results were disappointing. The commodity inflationary pressures we felt were significantly greater than anticipated. But to be clear, I remain confident about our future. First, we have a terrific portfolio. Being a leader in protein solutions is valuable in today's consumer landscape. Consumer demand for protein is an enduring trend and showing no signs of slowing down. Our portfolio is positioned for achievable growth.\nSecond, we are actively evolving to stay ahead of a dynamic and competitive marketplace. Transform and modernize is enabling us to unlock the full value of our portfolio. This initiative is building long-lasting capabilities, future fitting our supply chain and further developing our processes, data and talent. Said differently, this is truly helping us modernize as a company.\nAnd third, we have a great team. As I recently shared internally, I believe in a we mindset. Because while no single person has all the answers, I firmly believe that together, we do. I am energized by the opportunity to lead this talented team as we unlock the full potential of our impressive portfolio and company.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Jacinth to provide details on our financial performance, our fourth quarter outlook and commentary leading into fiscal 2026.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the top line growth we delivered in the third quarter. All 3 segments showed its unique strength and the top line results emphasize the power of our globally diverse portfolio, leading brands and team. Organic net sales in the third quarter were $3 billion, a 6% increase over last year with organic volume up 4%.\nOur Retail segment grew volume and net sales 5% over last year, with 5 of our 6 retail pillars reporting top line growth above a year ago. Volume growth was significantly supported by the Turkey portfolio, both in whole birds and value-added lean ground turkey. Excluding Turkey, retail volumes also grew in total. Our Foodservice business once again outperformed the broader industry. with broad-based top line gains of 2% organic volume growth and 7% organic net sales growth.\nOur international business delivered strong top line results with 8% volume growth and 6% net sales growth led by our thriving China business. Gross profit was relatively flat year-over-year as the positive impact from top line growth was offset by higher-than-expected input costs. Inflationary headwinds pressured margins However, these were partially mitigated by savings from our transform and modernize initiative, which delivered in line with our quarterly expectations.\nAs we noted during our second quarter call, we anticipated upward pressure on input costs driven by pork, beef and nut market. However, during the third quarter, markets worsened significantly beyond our projections. To illustrate the order of magnitude of these external markets. Beef also remained a persistent inflationary headwind industry-wide and near all-time high. Collectively, we experienced approximately 400 basis points of raw material cost inflation in the third quarter alone, representing a notable increase relative to last year.\nAs we have previously discussed, when commodity markets rise sharply, there is a delay between the impact of pricing actions and the resulting improvement of profitability. For the third quarter, adjusted SG&A increased 6%, primarily driven by employee-related expenses. Advertising investments were also higher for the quarter. as we continued to strategically invest in our brands to support long-term brand health.\nAquitaine earnings for the third quarter increased due to favorable results for MegaMex Foods and a modest benefit from our international investments. Interest and investment income increased due to performance from the Rabbi Trust. Overall, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.35.\nCash flow from operations was $157 million for the quarter a sequential improvement from the second quarter but remained down compared to the prior year as we intentionally built additional seasonal inventory, elevated commodity to market also impacted our higher inventory balances. Capital expenditures were $72 million during the quarter with our largest investments directed towards capacity enhancement and new technology initiatives. We remain committed to strategic reinvestments and expect to deploy approximately $300 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2025.\nI remain confident in our ability to generate strong, sustainable cash flows over the long term, which supports our continued execution of a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. As a proud dividend aristocrat, dividends paid to shareholders in the third quarter were $159 million, totaling $474 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2025. We also declared and paid our 388th consecutive quarterly dividend. We ended the quarter with our net debt leverage ratio well within our target range of 1.5 to 2x, reflecting our balance sheet discipline and financial flexibility.\nThe transform and modernize initiative continued to perform well and met our expectations for the quarter, delivering incremental benefits to the bottom line. The team has executed impactful work to drive value, which totaled approximately 90 projects in the third quarter. As we have shared, this initiative is more than just a cost savings project. It is about the way we do business across the enterprise, building new capabilities and reshaping how we operate while creating a new path for growth.\nAn especially noteworthy project this quarter involves optimizing our manufacturing footprint, we announced the partial closure of one facility and the reallocation of production volume across our broader network aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and long-term scalability. Our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental benefits in fiscal year 2025 and believe we will finish the year near the high end of our T&M range.\nShifting to the remainder of 2025. There are some considerations to keep in mind as we close the year. We continue to expect the top line growth in the fourth quarter and we expect our Turkey portfolio, the plant is brand and our leading positions in the marketplace to continue to be a strong growth driver. For profitability, we have announced inflation-based pricing actions related to the third quarter market, which we expect to partially benefit the fourth quarter and carry into the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nAs the fourth quarter has begun, counter to our expectations, commodity markets have remained elevated across a variety of input. With that, we're assessing additional pricing actions. Our tariff estimate remains unchanged at a $0.01 to $0.02 EPS headwind for fiscal year 2025. Altogether, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.40, reflecting a prudent outlook amid ongoing industry dynamics.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2026, we are approaching the time line for delivering on the long-term financial goals we outlined at our 2023 Investor Day. Over the past 2 years, we have numerous achievements to be proud of, especially within our transform and modernize initiative where we have extracted value and invested in developing processes talent and capabilities that will help propel us into the future.\nHowever, the growth goals we previously set for 2026 were based on certain assumptions that have not been realized. Among those assumptions or expectations of a more stable input cost environment, stronger consumer sentiment and earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2025. That being said, as Jeff and John have mentioned, we are aligned and focused on returning to profitable growth.\n\nJeffrey M. Ettinger\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nWe are in the early days of our annual planning process. And while we are not providing fiscal 2026 guidance today, our belief is that our long-term growth algorithm is a better metric to use when considering our go-forward results. As we look ahead, we expect the top line to benefit from pricing actions, growth across our brands and product mix improvements.\nOn the bottom line, we expect continued meaningful benefits from our transform and modernize initiative, benefits from the manufacturing footprint decisions we have made this year and possible cost reductions related to SG&A spend, which has outpaced growth in recent years. We will provide our holistic 2026 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nBefore we transition to Q&A, I want to leave you with a clear message. We are not just navigating the presence. We are building a better company for the future. My confidence in our future is grounded in the strength of our robust protein-centric portfolio, the resilience of our team and the long-term capabilities we are building to drive sustainable growth. At the same time, we recognize that our bottom line performance did not reflect the potential of our business this quarter.\nWe are committed to driving growth and enhancing long-term profitability. Our balance sheet is strong, and we believe our top line growth is sustainable. We remain focused on delivering lasting value for our shareholders through consistent top line and bottom line performance aligned with our long-term growth algorithm.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A portion of the call.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, May 29, 2025. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jess Blomberg, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJess Blomberg\n\nGood morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. We released results this morning before the market opened. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website, hormelfoods.com, under the Investors section, along with our supplemental slide materials.\nOn our call today is Jim Snee, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jacinth Smiley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Ghingo, Executive Vice President of the Retail segment. Jim and Jacinth will review the company's fiscal 2025 second quarter results and provide a perspective on the remainder of the year. Then John will join Jim and Jacinth for the Q&A portion of the call. The line will be open for questions following the prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] At the conclusion of this morning's call, a webcast replay will be posted to our investor website and archived for 1 year.\nBefore we get started this morning, I'd like to reference our safe harbor statements. Some of the comments we make today will be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which can be accessed at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. Additionally, please note, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning. Management believes that doing so provides investors with a better understanding of the company's underlying operating performance. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Further information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including our comparability items and reconciliations, are detailed in our press release, which can be accessed from our corporate or investor website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.\n\nJames P. Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. We achieved solid organic top line growth and delivered second quarter results in line with our expectations. We are committed to delivering profitable and predictable growth. And despite a dynamic operating environment, we stayed focused on our long-term strategy, executed with discipline and delivered results consistent with our expectations.\nIn Retail, we continue to hold leadership positions in the marketplace across our diverse portfolio. Our success with both consumers and customers is rooted in providing a stable, reliable brand and products they can trust -- while continuously evolving to meet the expectations of today's market. We continue to find ways to drive value for our consumers beyond price through quality, product differentiation, innovation and convenience.\nThis quarter, I want to highlight 3 areas of the Retail portfolio that really brought this to life. The Applegate brand is well aligned with today's consumer demand for convenient protein solutions. The brand experienced incredible sales growth, outpacing the total edible category while also growing households. The launch of the convenience breakfast platform has been well received in the marketplace.\nBuilding on that momentum, the brand recently introduced a new line of lightly breaded chicken products, further expanding its reach and relevance. This ongoing pipeline of innovation, combined with a compelling value proposition, reinforces our confidence in the sustained strength and growth potential of the Applegate brand.\nAt the same time, Jennie-O lean ground turkey continues to be a high-performing and strategically important offering within our portfolio, positioned to meet today's consumer preferences. As demand for lean high-protein food grows, Jennie-O is a go-to choice for consumers, demonstrated by consistent consumption gains and strong category leadership. Through the strategic transformation of the Jennie-O business over the last few years, we are further aligned as a demand-driven portfolio. We continue to have the right strategy and structure for steady long-term growth.\nFinally, our Mexican foods portfolio delivered on the growing demand of high-quality and flavorful meal solutions at home. In the second quarter, we saw continued success with our legacy Herdez Salsa business, while our refrigerated guacamole portfolio experienced double-digit consumption growth, driven by Herdez and Wholly brands. To provide another authentic convenient meal solution, the team expanded our refrigerated entrees line to now include al pastor. Led by our flagship and rising brands, our broader retail portfolio is well positioned to deliver the quality, differentiation, innovation, and convenience that consumers demand in today's market.\nTurning now to Foodservice. Our Foodservice business remained resilient in the quarter despite industry softness. Many of our branded products, such as Jennie-O, Hormel Fire Braised Meats and Cafe H globally inspired proteins delivered strong volume and net sales growth in the quarter. Our direct selling organization solution-based approach and a diverse channel presence has once again outperformed the broader foodservice industry. In addition to our already diversified portfolio that provides high quality and convenient solutions, the team is motivated to deliver on flavor trends and help our operators serve their customers faster.\nAs an example, at the International Pizza Expo in March, the team showcased our latest pizza topping creation, recognizing that hot honey has become the fastest-growing pizza ingredient. Our team saw the perfect opportunity to capture that craveable sweet heat in the form of our premium quality sausage, ultimately creating Fontanini hot honey sliced sausage. Additionally, our Flash 180 sous vide chicken is designed to streamline back-of-the-house operations. It delivers a consistent, high-quality product while significantly reducing prep time and labor, allowing more operators to serve the most in-demand menu item, the chicken sandwich. It's this kind of multifaceted food forward thinking that keeps Hormel Foodservice a leader in the marketplace.\nRounding out our segments, our International business delivered strong top line growth in the quarter, driven by an impressive double-digit volume and net sales growth in exports and robust growth in China. Our in-country China business continued to perform well, led by customer and distribution expansions, and continues to lead the company in innovative product offerings. The recent launch of Hormel barbecue bites is just 1 example of the team's deep understanding of consumer trends and their ability to create meaningful innovations that address in-country market demands. These 6 examples demonstrate the continuous transformation of our portfolio with innovative, high-quality products that meet the evolving needs of our consumers.\nThis year is a story of momentum. And as we've discussed, we expect half 1 and half 2 results will look very different. What will not be different, however, is our strategy, as we have intentionally structured our business to balance changes in the marketplace. Our confidence in our brands and our team, our responsibility to our consumers, customers and operators and our commitment to long-term results for our shareholders remain.\nWe anticipate strong second half growth, led by our range of consumer-focused protein-centric products. Notably, we expect meaningful contributions from our turkey portfolio, continued momentum in the Planters brand, growth from our leading positions in the marketplace and ongoing benefits from our Transform and Modernize initiatives. Jacinth will walk through turkey and our continued progress against our Transform and Modernize initiative in more detail.\nBut I want to take a moment to dive further into a Planters and SPAM update. Our Planters snack nuts performance exceeded our second quarter expectations, and these results have paved the way for what's to come in the second half. We expect to see sequential quarter-over-quarter sales improvement and year-over-year growth. This is a legacy powerhouse brand with a loyal consumer base and a portfolio of product offerings that ranges from classic comforts to bold flavors and textures. By investing in the brand and putting our proven strategy into action, we expect the Planters brand to be a driving force in the second half.\nTurning now to the SPAM brand. After an impressive first half, we expect an equally impressive second half. We continue to evolve this iconic brand while staying true to its core identity as a versatile, convenient protein solution. Its global momentum has been building, fueled by the strategic efforts to expand beyond the center store and deeper engagement with cultural trends. The rising popularity of SPAM musubi and a recent high-profile collaboration featured in a live action film set in Hawaii has led to significant merchandising activity and reinforced the brand's authentic cultural connection. We believe the SPAM brand is a timeless classic. Now we are confident in our growth trajectory for the back half of the year, supported by strong execution and strategic momentum.\nIn the face of an evolving backdrop, we are responsibly narrowing our fiscal 2025 outlook, which remains largely unchanged. For the full year, we now expect increased net sales growth of 2% to 3%, which is being supported by our value-added turkey portfolio, the Planters brand, our leading positions in the marketplace, continued growth in Foodservice and higher commodity markets overall. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.58 to $1.68, which takes into account our current views on the consumer, tariffs and lower investment income. This range implies impressive growth in the second half of the year, aided by investments across our brands and further benefits from our Transform and Modernize initiative.\nWhile the macro environment is ever changing, our strategy is consistent and clear. Our top line momentum is building. Our diversified portfolio allows us to navigate changing preferences and trends, and we are on track to deliver the benefits of our Transform and Modernize initiative, positioning us to regain our long-term growth trajectory. Our team continues to be, in my opinion, the best in the industry. And each and every one of us is committed to the long-term success of our company.\nNow before I transition the call to Jacinth, I'd like to address some of the leadership changes we announced this past quarter. Our incredibly competent management team and deep bench of talented leaders is a unique advantage for our company, and I am pleased to celebrate the advancements we have recently announced. First, Dr. Kevin Myers was appointed to lead our supply chain efforts. A nearly 25-year employee of Hormel Foods, Kevin has led critical areas, including product development, quality control, food safety and packaging design. Prior to joining the company, he spent a decade in the food industry, holding leadership roles in food technology and R&D. Kevin is widely respected for his expertise and insight. He is a trusted adviser and one of the most capable leaders in the organization. Candidly, he's one of the smartest people I know. With Kevin at the helm, we remain focused on transforming our supply chain, delivering for our customers and driving operational excellence.\nNext, we announced that Scott Aakre, Group Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer for Retail, will retire at the end of the fiscal year after an astounding 35-year career with Hormel Foods. We are pleased to share that Scott has been appointed to the Hormel Foods Board of Directors, ensuring we will continue to benefit from his strategic insight and deep brand expertise.\nThroughout his career, Scott has held several pivotal leadership roles, from guiding our grocery products marketing to leading corporate innovation and launching our brand fuel growth engine. On a personal note, I am grateful to have built my career alongside him. Scott's creativity, bold thinking and thoughtful leadership have left a lasting mark, and his impact will continue to shape our future.\nFinally, with Scott's impending retirement, we announced that Jeff Baker, a 35-year Hormel veteran, will lead the retail marketing efforts with the start of fiscal 2026. He will oversee the continued evolution of our branded portfolio, driving growth in snacking and entertaining and our food-forward platforms. Jeff's proven track record of growth, sharp strategic insight and a deep understanding of our brands and consumers has been built through his leadership roles across the company. Beyond his results, Jeff is known for his commitment to our company and his ability to foster an inclusive high-trust, high-performing culture. I'm fortunate to work alongside a team of such strategic senior leaders, and our recent leadership advancements give me great confidence in our company's future.\nAt this time, I will pass the call to Jacinth to discuss the financial details of our second quarter and provide more color on our outlook for the year.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted, we achieved solid organic top line growth and delivered second quarter results in line with our expectations. Our results once again demonstrate the effectiveness of our diverse portfolio.\nNet sales for the quarter were $2.9 billion, a 1% organic increase over last year. In Retail, our flagship and rising brands maintained leadership positions in the marketplace, and the Planters brand exceeded our volume and net sales expectations. Our Foodservice business again outperformed the broader foodservice industry, and our international business drove impressive top line growth in Q2, mainly due to double-digit volume and net sales growth in exports and strong growth in China.\nOur gross profit margin was 16.7%, reflecting anticipated higher commodity input costs. These known headwinds were partially offset by savings from our T&M initiative, which was on track for the second quarter. For the second quarter, expenses decreased 50 basis points, primarily driven by the lapping of prior year legal expenses and lower advertising as the brand teams continued to make strategic return on investment decisions. Interest and investment income for the second quarter decreased primarily due to lower cash balances and the performance from the rabbi trust. Altogether, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.33 for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.35, in line with expectations.\nCash flow from operations was $56 million for the quarter as we made an operational decision to build inventory for summer demand. Capital expenditures were $75 million, and our largest investments were related to value-added capacity and investments in data and technology. We continue to expect to invest $275 million to $300 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2025, with a continued focus on capacity, infrastructure investments and new technology.\nWe are committed to dividend growth and remain a proud dividend aristocrat, having increased our dividend for over 59 years. Dividends paid to shareholders in Q2 marked the 387th consecutive quarterly dividend. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in debt and remain at the low end of our stated net debt-to-EBITDA target.\nOur Transform and Modernize initiative remains a critical component of our strategy to restore historical earnings growth. The benefits realized in the first half of the year were as planned, and we remain focused and on track. While there are many milestones the team achieved for this quarter, there are 3 that I wanted to take a moment to highlight. As part of our ongoing efforts to future fit our supply chain, one of our priorities has been to increase efficiencies in our production processes. After careful consideration and planning, we made a difficult but necessary decision to close 1 of our 3 dry sausage production facilities in California and transfer that production to other internal facilities.\nAnother visible advancement has been the successful opening of our new distribution center in the Memphis, Tennessee metro area. This strategically located facility enhances our ability to serve customers more effectively, supporting increased demand and expectations for timely delivery.\nFinally, I am pleased by the team's success in advancing operational excellence through the Hormel production system, standardizing our ways of working across our manufacturing facilities. This transformation reflects a cultural shift that will deliver a long-lasting impact. We remain committed to delivering profitable and predictable growth, and the second quarter was another proof point of our commitment. We achieved results that met our expectations and firmly believe in our diversified portfolio, fueled by the Transform and Modernize initiative to achieve our long-term results.\nLooking ahead to the second half, we expect each of our segments to deliver strong top line growth. For Retail, we expect low single-digit net sales growth. For Foodservice, we expect mid-single-digit growth in organic net sales. And for the International segment, we expect continued strong top line performance resulting in high single-digit growth.\nWe expect advertising investments to significantly increase in the second half, and we are reaffirming our expectation for incremental benefits from the T&M initiative of $100 million to $150 million. Finally, we expect each segment to deliver bottom line growth in the third quarter and second half. An important component of our guide for the year is our turkey portfolio, and I would like to provide some additional insight into our assumptions. We continue to monitor turkey supply across the industry and our value-added pricing is in the marketplace implemented to offset the turkey pressures we discussed in the first half. We are constructive on our overall turkey portfolio and are impressed by the results we are seeing from value-added turkey across both Retail and Foodservice. Turkey remains a meaningful protein in our portfolio, as the demand for lean protein continues to grow.\nFor other commodity markets, we continue to expect markets to be above last year, mainly pork, beef and nut input costs. Our measured pricing actions and the benefit from our T&M initiatives will help to offset some of the input pressures contemplated in our guide.\nThe interest and investment income drag we experienced in the first half is not anticipated to be recouped. The impact for that line item alone was $0.03. Netting out our deferred compensation, the bottom line impact has been $0.02 to earnings per share.\nTurning now to tariffs. The global environment remains dynamic and ever-changing. Although our business has not been materially impacted by the tariff landscape to date, based on what we know today, we have assumed a range of $0.01 to $0.02 of tariff impact in the back half of the year in our outlook. In the face of this dynamic environment, we are responsibly narrowing our full year organic net sales growth outlook to a range of 2% to 3% and narrowing our adjusted diluted net earnings per share expectations to $1.58 to $1.68. We remain confident in our outlook for bottom line growth for each segment in the second half of the year and remain committed to delivering long-term value through strategic execution, including continued success from our Transform and Modernize initiative.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, February 27, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jess Blomberg, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJess Blomberg\n\nGood morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We released results this morning before the market opened. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website hormelfoods.com under the Investors section, along with our supplemental slide materials.\nOn our call today is Jim Snee, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jacinth Smiley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Ghingo, Executive Vice President of the Retail segment. Jim and Jacinth will review the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter results and provide a perspective on the remainder of the year. Then John will join Jim and Jacinth for the Q&A portion of the call.\nThe line will be open for questions following the prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] At the conclusion of this morning's call, a webcast replay will be posted to our Investors website and archived for 1 year.\nBefore we get started this morning, I'd like to reference our safe harbor statements. Some of the comments we make today will be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which can be accessed at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.\nAdditionally, please note, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning. Management believes that doing so provides investors with a better understanding of the company's underlying operating performance. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Further information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including our comparability items and reconciliations, are detailed in our press release, which can be accessed from our corporate or investor website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.\n\nJames P. Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. We achieved solid top line results in the first quarter and made great progress against our key priorities. We are on track to drive growth in the back half of the year and deliver on our 2025 expectations. Our value-added portfolio is strong and performing well, evidenced by our top line performance and our leadership positions in the marketplace.\nWe grew organic net sales 1% in the first quarter, which is encouraging given the dynamic consumer environment. Demand for key brands, including SPAM, Applegate, Jennie-O, Hormel Black Label, Hormel Fire Braised Meats and Cafe H globally inspired proteins was strong. Our value-added portfolio continues to be highly relevant to customers, consumers and operators.\nOur teams executed well in the first quarter to deliver these results. And I'd like to highlight a few of the initiatives that contributed to our organic top line growth. In retail, focusing our resources on our flagship and rising brands has proven to be highly effective. We grew overall volume and net sales for these brands, led by SPAM, Applegate Natural and Organic Meats, Hormel Black Label Bacon and Jennie-O Lean Ground Turkey. One of our most iconic brands, SPAM, has increased households and attracted younger consumers due to our focused investments. In the first quarter, this included the successful Sizzle marketing campaign, on-trend flavors like Korean Barbecue and new avenues of product usage, such as the launch of SPAM Musubi in a national retail chain Sushi Department. Our investment and focus behind this brand is spotlighting its versatility and potential for continued growth.\nThe success of the Applegate brand in the quarter reflects our continued focus on leaning into our loyal consumers' values and needs. We understand that the Applegate consumer expects high-quality, great-tasting products with simple ingredient statements. This is just one reason the brand is leading the way in their respective categories in the natural channel.\nWe are also using innovation to generate additional growth. Most recently, we launched 2 new Applegate frozen convenient breakfast platforms with breakfast sandwiches and pancake and sausage sticks. This innovative and consumer-focused approach has fueled growth for the Applegate brand, driving volume and dollar growth across categories.\nAnother flagship brand, Hormel Black Label Bacon, continued to showcase the power of protein meaning indulgence. After a remarkable fiscal 2024 for Hormel Black Label, we are proving that the momentum we are building for the brand is lasting. The team continues to lean into powerful marketing and innovation. And our latest innovation, Hormel Black Label Oven-Ready, delivers an easy, convenient mess-free way to cook bacon.\nDespite a challenging macro environment, I am encouraged by the volume-led growth from our flagship and rising brands in the first quarter, and we expect our focused efforts to continue delivering results. A key driver of retail's momentum is the recovery of our Planters business, our largest flagship brand. The first quarter met our expectations with significant sequential recovery in the marketplace. The team has been taking the right actions to return the brand to top line growth with improved fill rates, distribution gains and accelerated innovation.\nDuring the holiday season, our team introduced 5 limited-time flavors to generate excitement. And these flavors brought a younger and incremental consumer to the snack nuts category. The Planters brand also played a starring role in our Here For The Snacks campaign. Seasonality for many of our retail brands peaks around the big game. Benefiting from the alignment that our go-forward structure has created, we were organized to implement a scaled multi-brand event, integrating Planters, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel Gatherings, Air Dev, [indiscernible] and Hormel Chili into a single campaign. This initiative represents a significant shift in how we show up in the retail space.\nWe transitioned from individual brand investments to a comprehensive multibrand media plan while capitalizing on a strategic partnership with ESPN.\nThe scale of our relevant portfolio changed our interactions with customer partners. For example, we doubled our in-store display counts compared to last year and received numerous accolades from our trusted retailers.\nLooking ahead for the retail segment, I am confident in our team's ability to build on the momentum we experienced in the first quarter with our flagship and rising brands. The breadth of our portfolio will continue to allow us to navigate the consumer environment. Expect to see innovative solutions addressing convenience and flavor needs launching in the coming months, along with continued advertising support for our key brands to drive profitable top line growth.\nShifting now to our foodservice segment, I would be remiss if I didn't start by acknowledging the upcoming retirement of Mark Ourada, our Group Vice President of Food Service, after an incredible 37-year career with Hormel Foods. Mark has been pivotal in the successful development and evolution of our $3.8 billion foodservice segment. And I know many of you have enjoyed meeting with Mark over the years. His passion for great food, his care for the team and his accountability to our customers and company will be greatly missed. We also announced David Weber, a 33-year Hormel Foods team member and current Vice President of Foodservice sales will succeed Mark to lead the foodservice segment. I look forward to many of you meeting David out on the road later this year, and I'm confident you will be energized by his passion for the industry and for our company.\nThe foodservice segment's results have been driven by strong performance across the premium prepared proteins, turkey, premium bacon and breakfast sausage categories. Products such as branded Jennie-O Turkey items, Hormel Fire Braised Meats and Cafe H Globally Inspired Proteins delivered strong volume and net sales growth in the quarter. Impressively, premium prepared proteins achieved a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales growth.\nLooking ahead for foodservice, we expect the team to continue driving growth through our solutions-based portfolio, the knowledge and expertise of our direct selling organization and our diverse channel and market presence.\nTurning now to our International segment. The first quarter was marked by several highlights demonstrating how we continue to develop our global presence. Two of our biggest global brands, SPAM and SKIPPY, excelled in the first quarter through branded exports. In China, the team advanced our snacking strategy with the introduction of Barbecue Bites, further solidifying our presence in the meat snacking category. The Barbecue Bites delivers an everyday offering with on-trend flavors and are a welcome alternative to carb-based snacks.\nWe also continue to benefit from our partnership with Garuda Food in the quarter, driving our stacking efforts into new channels with plans for further expansion into new markets in the future.\nAfter a strong recovery by our International segment last year, we continue to expect another year of growth in fiscal 2025. We also made solid progress on our transformation initiative in the first quarter. Our commitment remains to transform and modernize our processes, our portfolio and the way we create value in order to return the company to its historical earnings trajectory. Let me remind you that this is not a cost savings initiative, but a program designed to generate growth through investments in our people, processes, data and technology and our brands. In return, we will generate a continuous growth flywheel that allows top line momentum and bottom line returns.\nWe continue to optimize our portfolio in the quarter, divesting a noncore South Farm operation. This was our last connection to vertically integrated pork, further demonstrating our commitment to reducing commodity exposure and simplifying our portfolio. As we shared in our last call, we expect fiscal 2025 to be a milestone year in our T&M initiative as we expect to deliver $100 million to $150 million in additional benefits. We are off to a great start in 2025, and remain focused on achieving our 3-year goal.\nBefore I turn it over to Jacinth for further details on our results, I want to take a moment to reference my recent retirement announcement. As you saw in the news release, a search is underway for the next leader of our company. I want to emphasize my personal commitment and confidence in our ability to achieve our fiscal 2025 goals. We have started the year on track, and it is my firm belief that we have the right strategy in place, the right focused resources and the best brands, products and team members to continue to drive long-term sustainable earnings growth.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jacinth to discuss our financial commentary related to the first quarter and details on our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted, we achieved solid top line results in the first quarter and made great progress on our strategic priorities. Net sales for the quarter were $3 billion, a 1% organic increase over last year. Foodservice led our top line growth, primarily driven by strong performance across many of our premium categories. The Retail segment benefited from growth in our value-added portfolio and the International segment saw growth from their China business and exports.\nOur gross profit margin was 15.9%. Value-added growth was more than offset by year-over-year margin pressures related to the Planters recovery, higher commodity input costs, namely pork, beef and nuts, and the supply chain impacts of bird illnesses.\nFor the first quarter, adjusted SG&A expenses increased 2.5%, mainly due to employee-related expenses.\nWe continue to invest in our leading brands. We spent $43 million in advertising expenses during the first quarter, and as Jim noted, we plan to increase brand support to drive growth for fiscal 2025.\nInterest and investment income for the first quarter decreased primarily due to lower performance from the Rabbi Trust. The effective tax rate was 21.8%, which is favorable compared to the prior year due to the purchase of Federal transferable energy credits.\nWe reported diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.35.\nTurning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $309 million for the first quarter. We invested $72 million of capital expenditures, and our largest spend was for value-added capacity unlocks. We continue to estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 to be $275 million to $300 million with a focus on capacity, infrastructure investment and new technology.\nWe are committed to dividend growth and remain a proud dividend aristocrat. We paid our 386th consecutive quarterly dividend during the quarter at an annual rate of $1.16 per share, a 3% increase over last year.\nWe ended the first quarter with $2.9 billion in debt, and remain at the low end of our stated net debt-to-EBITDA target.\nOur overall value-added portfolio performed well in the marketplace and exceeded our expectations. The Planters recovery is on track and the brand delivered as expected in the quarter. As anticipated, we experienced negative impacts from lower year-over-year over whole-bird turkey markets and lower investment income. Additionally, we faced incremental headwinds as we navigated the supply chain impact of bird diseases and commodity market input costs, which were significantly higher year-over-year and above our expectations.\nTaken together, our first quarter earnings were in line with our expectations.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, for Retail, we expect net sales to be comparable to the prior year. In foodservice, we expect mid-single-digit growth in organic net sales. We expect strong top line performance for the International segment, resulting in high single-digit growth. We expect growth in our value-added portfolio and benefits from our T&M initiative to be partially offset by lower investment income and higher investments in people, data, technology and brand support. Additionally, we are pleased with our significant market recovery in the Planters business. However, we will have a difficult year-over-year comparison in the second quarter given the strong brand performance in the prior year.\nWe are also monitoring pressures in the turkey supply chain as we navigate bird diseases impacting poultry and will take appropriate actions to preserve profitability. Overall, for the second quarter, we expect our bottom line to be comparable to the first quarter and below prior year.\nShifting now to our second half guidance. We expect to significantly benefit from the recovery of our Planters brand. Value-added turkey is assumed to be a tailwind in the second half, and we are confident in our supply position. We anticipate broad-based growth in the foodservice segment and continued growth in China in the International segment. Continued investments in our brands and the transform and modernize initiative will drive value.\nFor the full year, we are reaffirming our organic net sales growth outlook of 1% to 3%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share expectations of $1.58 to $1.72. We remain confident in our outlook for bottom line growth from each segment in the second half of the year and remain committed to delivering long-term value through strategic execution, including continued success from our transform and modernize initiatives.\nTo conclude our remarks, we are pleased with our strong top line results this quarter, reflecting the strength in our value-added portfolio and leadership positions in the marketplace. As we look ahead, we are confident in our execution of our strategic priorities, including our transform and modernize initiative. Our solid financial foundation and strategic focus position us well to achieve our targets and continue delivering sustainable growth.\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of this call.",

Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. In fiscal 2024, we demonstrated the solid execution of our strategy, the power of our portfolio and the resilience of our team. In our business segments, we navigated a dynamic macro consumer environment by reinvesting in our brands, expanding market presence and introducing innovative solutions across our portfolio. In doing so, we delivered solid results, coming in line with our adjusted diluted net earnings per share expectations for the year.\nWe made significant progress in the first year of our transform and modernize initiative, delivering an impressive $75 million in operating income benefit and setting our company up for growth and long-term success. With our disciplined financial approach, the strength of our value-added portfolio and the benefits from transform and modernize we delivered a record year of operating cash flow, enabling us to return a record amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. In retail, we leveraged the strength of our brands by prioritizing resources towards brands and categories where we know we can win.\nFlagship and rising brands such as Hormel Black Label, Jennie-O, SPAM and Applegate delivered strong growth and expanded households across on-trend categories. We brought meaningful consumer-centric innovation to our brands and fuel their growth through increased advertising investments. We continue to expand our leadership in our Foodservice segment, growing net sales by 6%, well above industry growth. This success highlighted the differentiated value and relevant offerings our dedicated team brings to the industry.\nThe team executed on our strategic priorities by launching solution-based innovation for our operators and drove impressive growth in the convenience channel by expanding distribution of entertaining and snacking brands like Columbus and Gatherings. And as expected, we saw the strong recovery of our International segment. We increased branded exports for the SPAM family of products and Skippy Peanut Butter. We drove growth from investments in the Philippines and Indonesia and achieved a solid recovery of our China business. We remain well positioned to deliver growth and expand our global presence.\nIn addition to delivering on expectations and driving momentum with our value-added portfolio, we accomplished other considerable milestones in fiscal 2024. We drove 140 basis point increase in our estimated net sales from innovation. Successful innovation underscores the importance of understanding consumer and operator needs and delivering effective solutions, especially in this dynamic macro environment. Our brand teams understand that consumers are hungry for new food experiences, both in home and away from home. Innovation will continue to be foundational to our growth strategy, supported by our exceptional R&D professionals, signature chefs and brand fuel team. And the safety of our employees will always remain a pillar of our culture.\nI am proud to report that in fiscal 2024, we achieved our safest year in our company's history. This milestone is fundamental to our success and a testament to our team members' focus on our safety first culture. Cash flow has always been a bedrock of our company. And this year, we broke our all-time record for operating cash flow, delivering $1.3 billion for the year. The strength of our portfolio, the disciplined operation of our business and the success of our T&M initiative allowed us to deliver this significant achievement. As a result of our record operating cash flow and disciplined capital allocation strategy, we once again returned a record amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. We also recently announced the 59th consecutive increase to our annual dividend, a record we are incredibly proud of.\nThere are a number of reasons to be excited about the position we are in today because in fiscal '24, we overcame significant headwinds to deliver our earnings guidance. We leveraged the strength of our value-added portfolio across our retail, food service and international [ savings ]. And we delivered $75 million of operating income benefits through our transform and modernize initiative. As we head into 2025, our brands continue to have either #1 or #2 share positions in over 40 retail categories. We are making strategic investments into flagship and rising brands like Hormel Black Label [ bacon ], planters, SPAM, Applegate and Jennie-O.\nOur Foodservice segment continues to provide unique value in the marketplace, and our International segment is well positioned to deliver growth and expand our global presence. Transform and modernize is on track, delivering value and helping to return the company to its historical earnings trajectory. There is a growth mindset embedded in our culture, allowing us to be more competitive, agile and capital efficient. We are fueling investments back into the business to drive growth and deliver shareholder returns. The momentum in our underlying business, coupled with the strength of our most transformative initiative ever gives me great confidence in our team, brands and companies.\nI will now transition the call to Jacinth for her remarks.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. And to everyone joining us today, I would like to echo Jim's comments around the confidence in our business, the power of our portfolio and the strength of our global team and culture. Volume for the fourth quarter was [ 1.1 billion pounds ], and the net sales were $3.1 billion. For the full year, volume was [ 4.3 billion pounds ] and net sales were $11.9 billion. Gross margin in the fourth quarter and full year increased 50 basis points to 16.6% and 17%, respectively. This reflects the strength of our value-added portfolio and the early successes of our transform and modernize initiatives. Full year expenses increased compared to last year, primarily due to employee-related expenses and the T&M initiative.\nWe expect SG&A expenses to increase in fiscal 2025. Advertising investments for fiscal 2024 were $163 million, up 2% compared to last year. We have planned for double-digit percentage increases in advertising investments in fiscal 2025. For fiscal 2024, interest and investment income increased due to favorable Rabi Trust performance and higher interest rate. Interest expense increased due to higher rates on debt issued during the year. Our fiscal 2025 expectations assume lower interest and investment income and comparable interest expense.\nOperating income for fiscal 2024 was $1.1 billion. Operating margin was 9% and adjusted operating margin was 9.6%. The tax rate for fiscal 2024 was 22.3%, and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. For the full year, diluted net earnings per share was $1.47 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.58. Turning now to the balance sheet.\nWe remain committed to dividend growth, investing in our business and maintaining our investment-grade rating. Our record cash flows from operations of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and disciplined financial strategy directly support these commitments. In fiscal 2024, we returned a record $615 million store shareholders in the form of dividends, including payment of our 385th consecutive quarterly dividend. We also recently announced an increase of our annual dividend of 3% to $1.16 per share for fiscal 2025. This will represent a remarkable 59th consecutive year of dividend increases. We invested $256 million in capital projects during fiscal 2024 and our largest projects were focused on capacity for value-added growth.\nWe are targeting between $275 million and $300 million in capital projects for fiscal 2025. We ended the year with $2.9 billion of debt and over $765 million in cash and short-term securities. We remain comfortably within our stated goal of 1.5 to 2x net debt to EBITDA. Inventories finished the year at $1.6 billion, a decrease of $104 million from the beginning of the year. We enter fiscal 2025 with responsible levels of inventory to service our customers and ample production capacity to grow our business. Finally, I would like to provide additional color on a few items for fiscal 2024.\nFirst, as we noted during our third quarter earnings call, we experienced storm damage to our Patelin Nebraska facility in early Q4. This event resulted in approximately $9 million of negative impact to the fourth quarter. Second, we made significant progress during the quarter regarding the Suffolk production disruption. We are improving fill rates, regaining distribution refilling shelves and prioritizing innovation. At the same time, we do expect some near-term commercial impacts and higher costs, most notably in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nWe expect to benefit from the recaptured momentum in the Planters brand starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Lastly, in the final week of the fiscal year, we divested of our Hormel Health Labs business, which was reported in our Foodservice segment and contributed [ 64 million pounds ] and $108 million net sales to our top line and approximately $0.01 to adjusted EPS in fiscal 2024, which will not be repeated in future years. Shifting now to our fiscal 2025 outlook.\nWe expect each segment to deliver top line growth as we continue to provide innovative offerings in the marketplace and increase investments in our brands. For full year fiscal 2025, we expect the following in each of our segments. Retail comparable volume and low single-digit increases in net sales. Food service after adjusting for Hormel Health Labs divestiture, mid-single-digit increases in volume and mid-single-digit increases in net sales. And for International, low single-digit increases in volume and high single-digit increases in net sales. We also anticipate segment profit growth from each segment for the full year with growth weighted towards the back half of the year.\nRegarding key input cost assumptions in our fiscal 2025 outlook, we expect port input costs to be comparable to fiscal 2024 and remain above the 5-year average. Beef costs continue to be a headwind, not input cost to be a drag year-over-year. Turkey markets to continue to be depressed for the full year with lower year-over-year whole-bird prices specifically in the first quarter. Our outlook also accounts for a moderate benefit due to favorable grain prices. I would also like to note that we expect $0.04 to $0.05 of unfavorable earnings per share impact in the first quarter from lower year-over-year whole bird prices and the suffer production disruption.\nIn total, we expect net sales of $11.9 billion to $12.2 billion, organic net sales growth of 1% to 3%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.58 to $1.72. And an estimated $100 million to $150 million of incremental benefits from the T&M initiative. To the entire Warmell Foods team around the globe, I thank you for your dedicated efforts in fiscal 2024, and I look forward to achieving our fiscal 2025 goals working alongside you.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames P. Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThanks, Jacinth. Please advance to Slide 13, where we will begin the next portion of our call and provide an update on our transformation initiatives. I will provide a brief introduction before turning the call over to Jacinth and Nathan. Just over 1 year ago, at our 2023 Investor Day, we announced the most transformative initiative in our company's history. Our commitment is to transform and modernize our processes, our portfolio and the way we create value. We are doing this by investing in our people, data and technology and our brands. Today, you will hear about the significant progress we made in 2024 against our commitment.\nAt Investor Day, we described 3 interconnected buckets of opportunity for earnings growth. As a reminder, the purpose of our growth initiative is to regain historical predictable earnings growth and drive long-term value. The transform and modernize benefits generate incremental investment to drive business growth. As our business grows, we expect to deliver even more benefits through our transformational initiatives. We are creating a sustainable growth engine for the company and watching year 1 unfold in such a powerful way gives me confidence in our future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Jacinth for you to hear more about our progress.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim. As Jim noted, we have made significant progress in year 1. I will take a few minutes to talk about our successes today and our expectations over the next 2 years, inclusive of the investments we are making to drive those benefits. As a reminder, Transform and modernized is not just a cost savings exercise, although that certainly is a real and substantial benefit. Rather, transform and modernize is about the way we do business across the enterprise, and it involves every single member of the Hormel Foods team.\nIt is about reshaping how we operate creating new opportunities for growth and generating a powerful growth flywheel. And to make all that happen, we're making strategic investments in key areas of the business. As we shared with you last year, we have organized the initiative into 5 tellers. 4 of those pillars focus on supply chain efficiency. With plan, we are adopting a holistic approach to end-to-end planning with. With Buy, we're implementing new more sourcing events to reduce costs and improve our procurement structure and tools. With Make, we're standardizing ways of working to improve yields, increase capacity and avoid unnecessary CapEx. And with Move, we're assessing and addressing near-term capacity and long-term network optimization.\nRegarding portfolio optimization, we're finding new ways to reduce complexity, address low-margin items and create room in our portfolio for further innovation. This work is being done at both the brand and business level to ensure our portfolio reflects our company's strategy and leverages our core competencies. Nathan will be providing more detail and actual examples for each of these 5 pillars in just a few minutes.\nBut before I turn it over to Nathan, I want to reiterate that year 1 of transform and modernize was a success, delivering $75 million in benefits. It is important to note, however, that this only reflects the benefits from the buy, make and move pillars of our T&M initiative. Specifically, we have seen the greatest savings from the improvements in logistics followed by raw materials and supplies and then manufacturing efficiencies.\nLooking at fiscal 2025, we're expecting annualized operating income benefit from T&M to be in the range of $100 million to $150 million compared with 2024 operating income, and that is an addition to the $75 million we achieved this past year. In fiscal 2025, we expect the largest savings from these efforts to come through raw materials and supplies followed by significant benefits from manufacturing and logistics. We also made excellent progress with our plan and portfolio optimization pillars. With our planned pillar, we expanded on our end-to-end planning capabilities.\nWe are building an infrastructure that ensures a more accurate demand signal flows through to our supply planning, and that is absolutely critical. With portfolio optimization, we have made progress in harnessing the power of our portfolio, which is resulting in a more consumer-centric, less complex, more profitable product mix. More broadly, we believe that T&M initiative is enhancing Hormel Foods capabilities and unlocking our full potential.\nAs I mentioned before, this is not just a cost savings initiative. We are making foundational investments in data and technology and people and processes to transform our company. In total, we're expecting to spend approximately $250 million through 2026. Taking a closer look at our spend, within the people and process category, we are investing in talent and upskilling our team members while creating a much more data-driven and analytical organization with modern processes. Importantly, we are driving complexity out of the organization.\nWith our data and technology investments, we are building the analytical capabilities to make empower decisions based on strategic insights to gain a competitive edge across all of our businesses. Ultimately, we believe we are creating an incredibly powerful flywheel of sustained value creation. By focusing on investments, transformation and growth, we are laying the foundation for profitable and predictable growth, not just today but for years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Nathan Annis, our Vice President of Corporate Development, who will provide a deeper dive into our transformational initiatives.\n\nNathan P. Annis\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, Jacinth. It has been a couple of years since 2021 when I was last in Investor Relations. And it's exciting to be back giving you an update on our transform and modernize initiative and to review some case studies that highlight our progress and the value we're creating. Our transform and modernize initiative is reshaping how we operate across the company in 4 key ways. First, our processes have historically been built on deep institutional knowledge and we're quite manual. As our company has grown, these processes became more complex and highly customized. We have started transforming these processes into streamlined enterprise-wide ways of working that leverage intelligent automation and digitization. I cannot overstate how critical this changes to all the work we are doing in our initiatives.\nNext, our key capabilities like business planning and execution used to be siloed and underleveraged. Over the recent years and quarters, we've moved to centralize these functions to capitalize on our scale while also strategically investing in areas where we are differentiated in the marketplace. Historically, our business was overly complex, bogged down by a lengthy list of vendors and SKUs. Looking ahead, we are simplifying our operations in a smart, data-driven way. We're also strategically segmenting our business to optimize our investments.\nLast, where we once had a variety of methods for identifying and realizing value and savings, we now use a standardized, more disciplined approach. This new process ensures we are capturing value consistently with clear accountability tied to key metrics. These 4 strategic changes are integral to the work we are doing, and our team is setting a new standard for excellence in these areas. Now let's explore some specific examples of how these changes are making a difference in the 5 pillars, beginning with Buy.\nThis pillar represents a comprehensive enterprise effort to develop a new framework and tools for procuring goods and services across the entire organization. Our prior efforts of creating one supply chain and restructuring our segments through go forward are paying dividends as we scope opportunities. Viewing procurement through an enterprise-wide lens allows us to significantly transform how we operate.\nFor instance, we're establishing a new operating model that includes a modern structure, standardized training and updated policies and governance. Additionally, we're adopting new procurement systems such as advanced sourcing tools, should cost modeling capabilities and enhanced data visibility and analytics. In 2024, we began implementing the buy pillar by focusing on categories and cost of goods sold and indirect spend. For 2025, our goal is to target the remaining categories across our P&L.\nBy 2026, we expect this new approach will be fully embedded in our culture. And we anticipate benefiting from consistent year-over-year productivity growth. A great example of our efforts with the by pillar is a recent sourcing event focused on routine supplies and parts for our manufacturing facilities. In the past, these items were procured through a fragmented process with hundreds of vendors and inconsistent purchasing methods. By streamlining our sourcing strategy and using enterprise-wide agreements, we've significantly reduced complexity and our number of vendors while targeting improvements in our inventory levels.\nThis project is just one of many that we are implementing to drive value. By incorporating these new tools and methodologies into our operations, we are developing a procurement function that delivers substantial financial savings, boost cash flow and sets the foundation for sustainable benefits well into the future. In the make pillar, we are transforming the way we manage our manufacturing network to boost efficiency increase capacity and reduce costs through the implementation of our proprietary Hormel production system or HPS.\nThe essence of HPS lies in standardizing the ways of working across all our manufacturing facilities. By introducing consistent management processes backed by a maturity model that ensures accountability, we're embedding the right practices at every level of our organization. Initially, we've concentrated these efforts on facilities facing capacity limitations. HPS is not only enhancing production yields and improving capacity but also boosting team member engagement while reducing downtime, working capital and overall cost.\nA standout success story from the Hormel production system comes from our efforts to address production bottlenecks for Hormel Bacon 1, fully cooked bacon at our Wichita, Kansas facility. Our foodservice team has consistently driven growth for this differentiated and highly profitable brand, but our capacity limitations were hindering our ability to fully meet demand. A possible solution was to add new production lines, which would have been expensive and require significant lead time to implement. By deploying HPS at Wichita, we increased capacity by approximately 18%. This increase not only allows us to meet future demand, but also brings lasting improvements in productivity, cost efficiency and T morale.\nBy extending these best practices to other facilities facing similar challenges, we are enhancing the agility and responsiveness of our manufacturing network. This shift not only helps us keep pace with current demand but also lays the groundwork for sustained long-term growth. Our move pillar is all about enhancing our logistics network and boosting distribution capacity. A significant achievement in this pillar has been the renegotiation of enterprise-wide freight rates.\nWith a detailed freight RFP process supported by our procurement team we have secured immediate cost reductions. Additionally, we have optimized the flow of finished goods through our network, effectively lowering landed cost. Looking forward, A key milestone for the Move pillar will be the opening of a new distribution center in the Memphis metropolitan area. Scheduled to become operational in the second half of 2025, we expect this facility will greatly improve our inventory management and expand our distribution capability.\nReiterating what Jacinth shared, our investments go beyond just cutting cost they're crucial for creating a more robust and scalable logistics network. The plan pillar is perhaps the most extensive and complex of our 5 pillars. And we believe our work here will revolutionize our approach to end-to-end planning across the company. Historically, our planning processes have been overly manual dependent on spreadsheets, legacy technology and numerous different processes.\nOur efforts are fundamentally transforming our planning function by centralizing these activities, adopting integrated business planning across all business units and embedding more data analytics and AI to guide our decisions. We believe this comprehensive, integrated and scalable approach will enhance service levels reduce cost, decrease working capital and improve engagement for hundreds of team members across various functions.\nThis all sets the stage for a more efficient and responsive organization. Portfolio optimization is a critical element of this initiative and is designed to reshape our product portfolio to improve margins and drive top line growth. This strategic focus touches all pillars and ultimately enables us to streamline operations and concentrate on the most profitable and growth-oriented categories. Historically, we have had a long tail of unprofitable or low volume items, and we have managed these inconsistently across the enterprise.\nThe restructuring of our company through go-forward has allowed us to take a more enterprise approach. And during 2024, our efforts have centered on creating a rigorous process to consistently assess and manage every item in our portfolio. As a result of these strategic evaluations, we've taken decisive steps, including divesting a nonstrategic business, Hormel Health Labs. Additionally, we've taken action on a large number of low volume or unprofitable SKUs and we will continue to rightsize our portfolio.\nPortfolio optimization is also about strategically reinvesting in innovation. And we are tailoring our portfolio to resonate with current consumer and operator trends to fuel sustainable growth. This ongoing process ensures that each product in our portfolio is capable of making a significant contribution to our revenues and margins, ensuring Hormel Foods remains the leader in the marketplace. We made excellent progress in 2024, and we're excited to continue our work and drive accelerated value in 2025 and 2026.\nThrough continued investments in data people, process and technology, we are unlocking the potential of our people across the enterprise and positively impacting all aspects of our financials. We're incredibly excited by how these 5 pillars have become increasingly interconnected and how the work has converged with other enterprise objectives, the merging of these activities means that they are rapidly becoming ingrained in our culture and helping to transform Hormel Foods into a more efficient, responsive and competitive company.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back over to Jim.\n\nJames P. Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThanks, Nathan. As we wrap up our remarks this morning, I think it's important to recognize that we are a stronger company today because of the strategic actions we've taken in the past, like one supply chain and go forward. These actions, combined with our transform and modernize initiative, positions us for continuous improvement, profitable and predictable growth and sustainable long-term shareholder value creation. We remain committed to our long-term growth algorithm of generating between 2% to 3% organic net sales growth and between 5% to 7% operating income growth.\nThere are many reasons to believe in our long-term strategy. We have a portfolio of leading and differentiated brands, which are fueled by innovation. We are organized for long-term growth with an ability to deliver stable financial performance, and we do all of this with a focus on being a strong corporate citizen. We are building a more efficient, scalable and adaptable organization that is well positioned to meet the demands of an evolving marketplace. All of this would not be possible without the dedication and performance of our team members, and I want to thank them for their hard work and commitment.\nWith that, Just, John, Nathan and I will take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to David Dahlstrom, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid W. Dahlstrom\n\nDirector of IR, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nGood morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.\n\nJames P. Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We delivered a strong first half of the year with consecutive quarters of better-than-expected earnings, a significant improvement in operating cash flows, food service strength recovery in our international business and stable volumes across our business.\nImportantly, we made further progress on our strategic initiatives and we remain on track to deliver on our commitments to drive long-term shareholder returns and growth. We entered the year with a realistic and achievable path to improve our business over the next 3 years. And our first half performance demonstrates meaningful progress. We are driving savings, minimizing complexity and reducing costs. As a result of this work, we delivered meaningful gross profit improvement in both the second quarter and the first half of the year.\nWe are also capturing incremental value from our investments. The best example of this is the momentum our team has generated for the Planter snack nuts business, which is responding positively to our brand building and innovation efforts. Taken together, we are pleased to report first half adjusted diluted net earnings per share in line with last year. This represents improvement compared to our expectations heading into the year given the uncertain consumer environment and significant headwinds in our Turkey business.\nCore to our success so far this year is strong execution against our 6 strategic priorities, which include driving growth for each of our business segments, executing our enterprise entertaining and snacking vision and continuing to transform and modernize our company. We delivered an excellent first half within foodservice. Growing volume, net sales and segment profit mid-single digits, respectively. The second quarter represented the fourth consecutive quarter, our team achieved volume and segment profit growth. And the foodservice team has now delivered year-over-year segment profit growth for 9 out of the last 10 quarters. We continue to leverage our highly differentiated business model to provide innovative solutions to solve operator challenges.\nIn the second quarter, we once again saw strong contributions from BACON 1, our premium prepared proteins, Pepperoni and Jennie-O Turkey. With the help of our culinary collective and direct sales force, we continue to introduce innovative new offerings that are positioned to disrupt large foodservice categories. Two of our newest items, [ Hormel/180 ], [ Suvi ] Chicken and Hormel Ribbon Pepperoni have already exceeded our fiscal 2024 sales projections.\nAnd our new Cafe H Pork [ Alpass ] store product also has been well received in the marketplace. We recently featured these products at the National Restaurant Association show where the response from customers was overwhelmingly positive. We believe our Foodservice business is exceptionally well positioned to drive category growth, brand value and operator engagement well into the future.\nTransitioning to our International segment. Our performance has been very encouraging given the challenging conditions the team faced last year. From a profitability standpoint, International had a strong first half of the year with segment profit up almost 30%. Our team drove growth in many areas including our partnerships in Indonesia and the Philippines, our refrigerated export business and in-country operations in China and Brazil. Notably, in China, our foodservice business is performing relatively well, and our retail business continues to recover. We expect our retail business in China to improve in the back half of the year led by distribution gains of SPAM singles, the launch of new Skippy spreads and innovation in our shelf-stable meat snacking portfolio.\nOverall, we remain confident that we have the right strategy and structuring in place to drive growth in our international business and develop our global presence over the long term. In our Retail segment, we continue to navigate an environment characterized by an uncertain consumer backdrop and pressure from whole bird turkey dynamics. That said, there are many proof points showing that our focus on winning with consumers, winning with customers and driving profitable growth is delivering positive returns. According to Sir Can-A, we gained share across several of our flagship brands during the second quarter, including Planters, Black Label, SPAM and Jennie-O. Additionally, we increased total points of distribution by 6% for our flagship brands and 4% for our rising brands, which includes brands such as Applegate, [ Aird ], corn nuts and Hormel Square table. From a vertical perspective, we delivered strong results, both in terms of shipments and consumer takeaway with bacon.\nBlack Label raw and convenient bacon products are resonating with consumers and we expect this trend to continue in the back half of the year, supported by further advertising and innovation. Emerging Brands, which contains our Applegate and Justin's brands, also delivered a strong quarter with mid-single-digit volume and net sales growth compared to last year.\nSimilarly, within snacking and entertaining, we delivered net sales growth for planter Snack nuts. I'll provide more detail on our successes within this important category later in my remarks. Within convenient meals and proteins, we are experiencing mixed results. Our SPAM family of products and Square table entrees portfolios, both delivered a strong first half even in response to pricing actions. But we did experience softer demand for other center store canned and convenient items.\nWe are also seeing similar softness across the global flavors vertical and within the Mexican categories in which we compete. These trends are not entirely new and our teams are actively working to address this in the back half of the year.\nLastly, our value-added meats vertical continues to be negatively impacted by Turkey Dynamics. While we did drive growth during the first half across the Jennie-O value-added retail portfolio, these gains were more than offset by weaker whole turkey markets. We expect this business to remain challenged for the rest of the fiscal year.\nOur objective in retail is to balance volume and net sales gains to drive consistent, profitable growth. We are managing through challenges such as Turkey pricing and pockets of softer consumer demand. Longer term, the team remains focused on winning with our consumers and our customers, better allocating our resources and improving the margin structure of the business.\nNow moving on to our enterprise-wide entertainment and snacking strategy. where we continue to win by unlocking the value of our brands across the channels where we compete. Within retail, we saw some of the most positive in market data for the planters and corn nuts brands since our acquisition of the business, including volume, sales and share gains during the quarter for mixed nuts, cashews and corn nuts. This momentum is a direct result of expanded distribution and our investments in innovation, higher ROI advertising and brand building.\nAdditionally, we released several new entertaining and snacking items, including Planters, Salt and vinegar cashews, Planters nut Duos, loaded taco flavored corn nuts and a summer themed hard salami and pepperoni tray under the Hormel Gatherings brand. And we are supporting Hormel Pepperoni, America's #1 Pepperoni brand, our new national advertising campaign boldly irresistible highlights the versatility and craveability of this popular snack and is expected to help drive growth in the back half of the year.\nIn Foodservice, our team delivered excellent growth during the quarter in the convenience channel, led by Planters, flavored cashews and Corn Nut innovation. And internationally, we recently announced that the Skippy brand is returning to the Canadian market in the form of 5 all new peanut butter inspired snack products. This complements the work the team is doing to drive entertaining and snacking growth globally.\nTurning now to our last 2 strategic priorities: future fitting our one supply chain and advancing our transform and modernize initiative. In the second quarter, our supply chain efforts once again resulted in lower overall logistics expenses lower distressed sales and higher investment income from responsible capital management. We also made further progress on our transform and modernize initiative in the areas of supply chain efficiency, portfolio optimization and data and analytics.\nNow within our planned work stream, we continue the implementation of a new end-to-end planning process and are integrating new planning technology. In the [ by ] work stream, we are realizing the benefits from our new procurement and productivity programs. For the balance of the year, we are broadening our efforts outside the supply chain to all procurement areas.\nWithin [ MACE ], we completed a major improvement project to expand the capacity for our retail Can portfolio, allowing us to limit external production. Additionally, we launched a project to increase capacity for Bacon 1. Both projects use existing assets and infrastructure and are expected to generate strong returns.\nIn the [ move ] work stream, we implemented analytics across our refrigerated network to further enhance our service levels. We are also exploring an expansion of our refrigerated network to drive added benefits, and we continue to advance our total company portfolio optimization efforts. Leveraging our analytics tools and capabilities, we are finding opportunities to enhance and support margin profile improvements. We are eliminating lower-margin SKUs allowing us to maximize production time for more profitable items.\nAlso, this quarter, we celebrated the opening of our new $5 million childcare center in Austin, Minnesota. Not only does this new facility assist the company's recruiting efforts in today's tight labor market. But more importantly, the center provides a needed service for our team members and our community. This transformational work is a key driver of our growth over the next several years and is essential for building significant and scalable capabilities for our future.\nNow shifting to our updated 2024 outlook. We are reaffirming our full year top line outlook and updating our earnings outlook. We continue to expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%, assuming volume growth in key categories, a benefit from higher brand support and innovation and our current assumptions for raw material input costs. In Foodservice, we expect continued volume growth led by Bacon, Turkey, Pizza toppings and our line of premium prepared proteins. We expect net sales increases in our international business driven by branded exports and further recovery in China.\nIn retail, we expect higher net sales for our Bacon and emerging brands verticals. We have assumed net sales will be negatively impacted by volume and pricing headwinds in [ Holberg turkeys ] and higher elasticities in our center store business as previously discussed. From a bottom line perspective, we have increased the lower end of our diluted net earnings per share and adjusted diluted net earnings per share ranges to reflect our solid first half performance, and our expectations for growth from our Foodservice and International segments, ongoing improvements across our supply chain and benefits from our transform and modernize initiative.\nConsistent with our prior guidance, our full year outlook assumes higher salaries, normalized employee-related expenses and costs associated with planned investments in the business including higher advertising investments. An additional factor expected to impact both our net sales and earnings guidance ranges is an unplanned production interruption at our Planters facility in Suffolk, Virginia. We discovered a food safety issue in April, which has since been resolved. Jacinth will provide more detail regarding the financial impact in her comments. Taking all these factors into account for the full year, we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%, diluted net earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.55 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.65 and benefits to net earnings from our transform and modernize initiative which is expected to deliver its strongest level of savings in our fourth quarter.\nIn closing, our first half performance demonstrates our team's ability to execute our clear and achievable plan. We have line of sight to a strong second half of the year as we make further progress on the initiatives we laid out last fall. Our team remains focused on growing operating income, driving savings through our transform and modernize initiative and capturing incremental value from our investments. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the second quarter and first half and additional color on our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted in his opening comments, we delivered a strong first half of the year. Volume for the first half was [ GBP ] 2.2 billion comparable to last year. Broad-based volume growth in foodservice and growth in International offset a decline in our Retail segment. Of the [ GBP ] 29 million decline in retail, approximately 2/3 of the decline was related to lower sales across whole bird Turkey.\nNet sales for the second quarter and first half of the year were $2.9 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. Similar to volume, there is some nuance in the numbers. The approximate negative impact in net sales for the first half of the year related to whole birds turkey was 1% weighted more heavily against the second quarter. We increased gross profit by 3% in the second quarter and the first half, driven by strength across the supply chain and benefits from our transform and modernize initiative.\nGross profit margin improved 90 basis points to 17.4% in the second quarter. All segments delivered higher gross profit margins during the first half of the year. SG&A increased [ $64 ] million in the second quarter and $73 million during the first half of the year. These increases include the settlement of port antitrust litigation, higher employee-related expenses and higher external expenses, including $19 million related to incremental investments in our transform and modernize initiatives.\nAdvertising investments were up 27% in the second quarter and up 9% for the first half. We continue to support our leading brands in the marketplace with new advertising creatives and step up spending for the balance of the year, including for the SPAM, Hormel Pepperoni, Planters and Black Label brands. Equity in earnings for the second quarter and first half decreased due to lower results from MegaMex, partially offset by improvement from our international partnerships. Interest and investment income for the second quarter and first half increased as interest income from higher cash balances and favorable market interest rates offset higher interest expense associated with the recent debt issuance.\nEarnings before income taxes were $244 million for the second quarter and $530 million for the first half. On an adjusted basis, Earnings before income taxes for the first half were $564 million, a 1% increase compared to the first half of last year. The effective tax rate was 22.5% for the second quarter and 23% for the first half, which were higher than last year. Our prior year effective tax rate benefited from higher federal deductions. Given the higher rate to date, the effective tax rate for the fiscal 2024 year is now expected to be between 22% and 23%. The net result of all these factors was second quarter and first half diluted net earnings per share of $0.34 and $0.74, respectively.\nFirst half adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.79, in line with last year. We also delivered strong operating cash flow during the first half of the year. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $[ 640 ] million, an increase of 55%. We remain committed to dividend growth investing in our business and maintaining an investment-grade rating. We paid our 383rd consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15 at an annual rate of $1.13 per share.\nWe also announced our August dividend, which will represent our 96th year of uninterrupted dividends. We invested $60 million in capital projects during the second quarter. The largest capital projects for the quarter included the packaging projects for Planters and investment in our new order-to-cash system. Our outlook for capital expenditures in 2024 remains at $208 million. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and short-term securities and $3.8 billion of debt.\nDuring the quarter, we completed a debt offering of $500 million. We plan to use the proceeds of the issuance and the cash on hand to pay off the $950 million note that is due in June of this year. As Jim shared, we are reaffirming our full year net sales expectations and updating our earnings expectations. We expect third quarter port input costs to increase seasonally under seeing this pattern play out for key inputs such as bellies, trim and hogs.\nWe continue to assume full year pork input costs to be higher than last year and above 5-year averages. In Turkey, supply disruption this spring from HPAI was minimal, and we remain in a strong position to service our customers and attract new business opportunities. We are projecting growth across several parts of our genuine branded Turkey business, including lean ground turkey in retail and value-added Turkey in foodservice. Lower volumes and pricing for commodity whole turkeys are expected to continue to pressure earnings.\nAs Jim noted, we experienced an unplanned production interruption at our Planter facility in Suffolk, Virginia. This issue is expected to affect service levels on some of our highest volume and innovative items primarily impacting the third quarter. We have included in our updated earnings outlook and estimated $0.03 impact related to this issue.\nIn terms of our back half cadence, we expect third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be lower compared to last year and the second quarter. The primary drivers are continue to hold Turkey headwinds and the [ SFO ] production interruption. We expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter anticipating growth from all business segments and the strongest contribution of the year from our transform and modernize initiative.\nTo conclude my remarks, I would like to thank the entire team for their contributions to a solid first half of the year and for their continued commitment. There is more work ahead and we're confident that we have the right strategy, people and balanced portfolio to drive the business forward and deliver long-term sustainable value. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, led by better-than-expected performance in each of our segments and we have made good initial progress on our work to transform and modernize our company. We also achieved broad-based volume growth across our businesses, reflecting the strength of our leading brands, robust demand for our food service products and momentum in our Planter Snack Nuts business. These results demonstrate our team's meaningful execution against our strategic priorities, the value of our balanced business model and marked improvements in our supply chain.\nOur first quarter results were very encouraging. We grew volume in each of our segments with overall volume increasing 4%. Net sales grew 1%, led by another excellent quarter from our food service team. Adjusted operating margin increased compared to last year reflecting higher gross profit and disciplined cost management.\nDiluted net earnings per share was in line with last year, while on an adjusted basis, we grew our bottom line and cash from operations nearly doubled compared to the first quarter of last year, a direct result of our actions to better manage working capital and grow earnings. We have a clear and achievable path to deliver earnings growth and improve our business over the next 3 years. And as we outlined at our recent Investor Day, we are focused on 3 enterprise objectives to accelerate profitable growth. First, restoring dependable operating income growth from our current businesses. Second, driving savings through transformation and modernization; and third, capturing incremental value through our investments in the business.\nOur first quarter results demonstrate the strides we are making in each of these key focus areas. First, our results indicate progress towards restoring sustainable and dependable bottom line growth with momentum across the portfolio. Taking a closer look by business, food service is off to another fast start. Volume and net sales growth were broad-based across numerous categories, led by Jennie-O Turkey and double-digit gains for products such as HORMEL bacon 1 cook bacon, pepperoni, Austin Blues smoked meats and Cafe H globally inspired proteins. Segment profit increased 10%, driven by volume, mix and favorable logistics expenses. We continue to operate from a position of strength in food service due to our long-standing relationships, differentiated product portfolio, innovative solutions and direct sales team.\nThis was again acknowledged by the industry in January when we received the distributor's Choice Award for strategic partnership by the International Food Service Distributors Association. This honor recognized our team as the most strategic partner across the food service landscape. We also delivered a solid quarter in the convenience store channel led by our planters business. Volume was strong for our snacking business and convenience driven by positive takeaway for both the Planters and Corn Nuts brands. We expect our convenience store business will continue to be a growth catalyst in fiscal 2024, led by expanded distribution of our flavored cashews, innovation in corn nuts and better service levels on planters, peanuts and trail mix items. We also plan to further leverage the momentum in our Snack Nuts business to increase placements of our other items across the convenient store footprint. Our International business is also off to a better-than-anticipated start to the year as volume and segment profit both increased compared to last year.\nResults this quarter were very encouraging, particularly given the challenging conditions the team faced in fiscal 2023. We remain confident the International business will further accelerate over the course of the year, driven by more normalized shipments of SPAM and easing of headwinds impacting our commodity exports and growth from our partnerships around the world. In our Retail segment, our leading brands, execution in the marketplace and recovery in Turkey supported volume growth for the quarter. Demand was strong for many products, including Skippy peanut butter, Planter Snack Nuts, [ Poly dips, de and law Victoria's sauces ], refrigerated entrees and Hormel Pepperoni, which all grew volume and net sales during the quarter. Additionally, [ Sirona ] data noted several positives for the quarter as we gained or maintained share across many of our products in key categories, including the SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel Black Label Bacon, Jennie-O Ground Turkey, Hormel Pepperoni, Planter Snack Nuts, [ Air Des, salsas and sauces ] and Dinty Moore Stew.\nWhile we expect our retail business to face incremental pressure from [ Holberg ] Turkey dynamics and like many others in the industry and uncertain consumer backdrop. Our team remains focused on winning with our consumers and our customers, better allocating our resources to drive profitable growth and improving the margin structure of the business. Underpinning the strong starts from our businesses was improvement across our supply chain as we reverse the inefficiencies and higher operating costs that we absorbed this time last year. Our supply chain improvements resulted in lower freight and warehousing expenses, lower distressed sales and higher investment income resulting from a 4-day reduction in our cash cycle. Finished goods inventory was down on both a volume and dollar basis at the end of the first quarter, and total inventory was down almost 9% compared to last year.\nIn addition to forward progress on inventory management, fill rates benefited from the increased efficiency and overall health of our one supply chain. First quarter retail and food service fill rates increased compared to both the prior quarter and prior year. And our fill rates have surpassed 97% to begin the second quarter, marking the first time since March of 2020 that we have achieved this level of service. Turning to our second key strategic area, advancing our transformation and modernization initiative. This includes the areas of supply chain efficiency, portfolio optimization and data and analytics. We're in the early innings with these efforts, but we are pleased with the progress our team has made thus far. Notably, within our planned work stream, we are implementing a new end-to-end planning process and are integrating new planning technology. In the buy work stream, we are realizing the benefits from our new procurement and productivity programs with further savings expected across many categories, such as logistics, warehousing and supplies.\nUnder the make work stream, we are standardizing our ways of working across the manufacturing network. We are also continuing to take actions to optimize our refrigerated and ambient distribution networks within our move work stream. We made progress on our total company effort to improve our portfolio. Identifying approximately 10% of the items to be optimized. Throughout the year, we expect to use our enhanced data and analytics capabilities to identify more opportunities to better our portfolio. And to support these specific work streams and the broader goals of the organization, we formed a data and analytics office focused on creating easy access to reliable and consistent technology, data and analytics. Executing our transformation and modernization initiative remains a critical piece to our projected growth over the next 3 years, and I'm pleased with the team's early progress.\nMoving on to the third key focus area, capturing value from our investments, where our progress was highlighted by the strong momentum in our Planter Snack Nuts business. In the first quarter, Planters volume and dollar share maintained positive momentum, while total points of distribution and household penetration grew. We also continue to support the brand via higher ROI advertising and an always-on strategy. Most recently, with the launch of the [ Planters Ah Nuts ] campaign that went live in January. Innovation remains a point of focus for this business. One example is our flavored cashews line, which is delivering against our key performance indicators and remains on track to achieve its plan for the year. Importantly, this product line continues to over-index with younger consumers which is driving new consumers and excitement to the Snack Nuts category.\nOver the next few weeks, we will be launching additional innovation including a salt and vinegar line extension to our flavored cashews and a new-to-market offering, [ Planters Nut Duos ],which has the potential to be a significant contributor to the snack nuts category. We also continue to innovate with new varieties of Corn Nuts including loaded taco flavored corn nuts and Kick in [indiscernible] Pickle, which is expected to launch in time for summer. From a profitability perspective, we continue to put a heavy emphasis on redistributing our trade dollars to higher ROI promotions and channels, while simultaneously shifting mix toward innovation and premium nut varieties. These are just some of the high priority plans we have in place to keep the momentum going for our Planter Snack Nuts business in fiscal 2024 and beyond. We continue to take actions as the category leader to support the planters and core nuts brands and drive growth for our business, the category and for our customers.\nIn addition to the planters business, we have many opportunities to capture incremental value from other investments and initiatives this year and into the future. This includes driving further benefits from the Jennie-O Turkey Store transformation, our go-forward initiative and the recent investments made in capacity and automation. While we realize that 1 quarter does not make a year and there remains significant work ahead, we are confident that we are on the right track to deliver on our commitment to improve our business and increase long-term shareholder returns. Now shifting to our outlook. We are reaffirming our full year net sales and earnings expectations. From a top line perspective, we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%. This continues to assume volume growth in key categories, higher brand support and innovation and our current assumptions for raw material input costs. In retail, we expect higher net sales across many of our verticals. Targeted retail pricing actions will be effective by the end of the second quarter and are expected to impact our results in the back half of the year.\nIn food service, we expect broad volume growth similar to the first quarter, led by turkey, pepperoni and bacon. This volume growth, coupled with higher raw material input markets year-over-year should support net sales gains. We expect net sales increases in our international business to be driven by the branded export business led by refrigerated items, SKIPPY and SPAM and the retail and food service channels in China. From a bottom line perspective, we are also reaffirming our diluted net earnings per share and adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook. Consistent with our initial outlook, we expect continued growth in food service. Improvement in our international business and benefits from innovation in retail. Our full year outlook also assumes higher salaries, normalized employee-related expenses and costs associated with planned investments in the business. Diluted net earnings per share and adjusted diluted net earnings per share are expected to decline year-over-year in the second quarter and grow in the back half of the year.\nAt a high level, we are assuming our stronger-than-expected start to be partially offset by incremental earnings pressure coming from our whole bird turkey business. Jacinth will provide further details on these assumptions in her remarks. Taking all these factors into account for the full year, we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%. Diluted net earnings per share to be $1.43 to $1.57 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $1.51 to $1.65. And we expect a benefit to net earnings from our transformation and modernization initiatives. In closing, our strong start to the year reflects our team's ability to execute our clear and achievable plan. We remain focused on our strategic priorities and delivering on our commitment to improve our business and drive long-term shareholder returns. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the first quarter and additional color on key assumptions and our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, led by better-than-expected performance in each of our business segments. During the first quarter, we grew volume 4% and across all of our segments. Net sales for the first quarter were $3 billion, a 1% increase compared to the previous year. Gross profit increased 3% driven by higher net sales and lower logistics expenses. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 17% compared to 16.7% last year and 16.1% in the fourth quarter. Both our retail and food service teams drove better margins quarter-over-quarter and compared to last year. First quarter SG&A increased 8%, reflecting incremental investment in our transformation and modernization initiatives and higher employee-related expenses. Adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was marginally higher compared to last year.\nAdvertising investments are expected to be up significantly in the second quarter and increase for the full year. We are actively supporting our brands in the marketplace, including the SPAM, Planters and Hormel Chili brands. Equity and earnings of affiliates increased 3%, primarily due to the inclusion of minority interest in Garudafood and growth from our partnership in the Philippines. Operating income for the first quarter was $284 million and adjusted operating income was $295 million. Adjusted operating margin of 9.8% increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. The effective tax rate was 23.4% compared to 22.6% for the previous year. Our prior year effective tax rate benefited from the impact of certain discrete items and higher federal deductions.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be between 21% and 23%. The net result of all these factors was diluted net earnings per share of $0.40 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.41. Upside this past quarter compared to our expectations was driven by broad-based volume growth, strong results for all of our businesses, improvement across supply chain and below-the-line favorability. Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow of $404 million increased 98% compared to last year. This was a direct result of our successful actions to rectify the inefficiencies caused by elevated inventory levels last year and underlying business growth. Overall, we drove a 4-day reduction in our cash conversion cycle. We paid our 382nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $1.13 per share, an increase of 3%. We invested [ $4 million to $7 ] million in capital projects during the first quarter, including investments in our Jennie-O Turkey store transformation. Our outlook for capital expenditures in 2024 remains at $280 million.\nWe ended the first quarter with $982 million in cash and short-term investments and $3.3 billion of debt. We plan to utilize a combination of cash on hand and debt issued in the second quarter to pay our $950 million note due in June. We have accounted for a higher interest expense in our outlook and expect to remain within our stated goal of 1.5 to 2x net debt to EBITDA. I would like to further highlight the progress we have been making on our transformation and modernization initiative, which is expected to drive at least $200 million in operating income by 2026. Through the first quarter, we made great progress and remain on track to capture our full year savings target for fiscal 2024.\nThe work has intensified in the second quarter with the expectation that savings capture will accelerate throughout the year. This year, we are highly confident in our ability to capture direct savings from our productivity programs, which are targeting packaging, ingredients and other supply categories. Continued benefits from the work we have done lowering logistics expenses across our network, including lower contracted freight rates, optimized routes, increased truck weights and reduced reliance on third-party warehousing.\nBenefits from lower distressed sales as we make improvements to our inventory management planning and manufacturing processes. Value derived from new capabilities and ways of working, including integrated business planning and from the implementation of our standardized and proprietary manufacturing system across our network and benefit from minimizing complexity and reducing costs through portfolio optimization. This is a truly exciting and important time for our company as we build toward our future. Transitioning to our outlook. We are reaffirming our full year net sales and earnings expectations. The supplement what Jim reviewed earlier, I will share some additional color on our assumptions for the rest of the year. From a pork perspective, our outlook remains unchanged. The USDA is projecting modestly higher production and exports in 2024.\nCold storage levels for pork continued to trend below last year and historical averages, which we expect to be supportive of pork markets. We assumed full year pork input costs to be higher than last year and remain above 5-year averages. Specific to turkey, overall inventory levels have recovered despite lingering impacts from cases of HPAI in the fall and early winter barring a significant supply disruption this spring from additional outbreaks of HPAI, we are in a strong position to service our customers and attract new business opportunities. We made good progress regaining value-added Turkey distribution in the retail and food service channels during the first quarter, and we expect this to continue for the rest of fiscal 2024. On the commodity side of the business, all bird turkey markets have stabilized below our initial forecast. Consequently, we have included in our outlook, incremental earnings pressure from lower-than-expected market pricing. We began absorbing this impact in the first quarter and expect continued pressure for the balance of the year.\nNet-net, we now expect approximately $0.15 of earnings headwinds from our Turkey business in fiscal 2024 which is an update to the $0.10 impact we called out on our fourth quarter earnings call. Most of this $0.15 headwind will impact quarters 2 through 4. In the second quarter, we expect earnings to be lower compared to last year and lower relative to our expectations heading into the year primarily related to our whole bird turkey business. We remain confident in our growth outlook for the second half of the year, expecting all segments to deliver profit improvement in addition to benefits from our transformation and modernization initiatives. To wrap up our commentary this morning, I want to extend my gratitude to each and every member of our dedicated team. Your hard work has been instrumental in delivering a strong start to the year and contributing to the momentum in achieving our strategic objectives to improve our business for the long term.\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.\n\nJames P. Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2023 was a challenging year for the organization as we navigated an environment that remain volatile, complex and high cost. Regardless, our results did not meet our expectations. We still achieved our second consecutive year of net sales in excess of $12 billion, continue to reinvest in the growth of our leading brands, drove strong operating cash flows of $1 billion, returned a record amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and achieved the safest year in our company's history.\nWe also made further progress on our evolution as a global branded food company, including the implementation of our go-forward operating model, and the integration of Jennie-O Turkey Store. As we turn the page to fiscal 2024, there is urgency across the organization to improve our business. And as we outlined at our recent Investor Day, we have identified a clear, realistic and achievable path to return the business to its historical earnings trajectory. Our focus going forward is clear: first, restore a sustainable and dependable bottom line growth from our current business; second, drive savings by minimizing complexity and reducing costs; and third, capture incremental value from our investments. Our first milestone will be our performance in fiscal 2024, which is expected to be an investment year for the company.\nAs with any year, success will be predicated on how we execute against our strategy. First, we must drive focus and growth in our retail business. our nearly $8 billion powerhouse of leading brands, talented people and strong capabilities. Our retail team has made tremendous progress implementing the go-forward structure, which involves combining seven retail businesses and standing up our brand fuel center of excellence. Importantly, the retail team now operates with a single vision and clear strategic focus. We expect this team to win with our consumers and our customers, better allocate our resources to drive profitable growth, and improve the margin structure of the business. Second, we must continue to expand our leadership position in food service. This business has emerged from the pandemic stronger. And again delivered excellent results in fiscal 2023.\nIn fiscal 2024, we expect continued growth in foodservice. We are confident that we can accelerate growth in the key categories of bacon, pepperoni, prepared proteins and turkey. Also, we can establish a digital leadership position in the industry and expand our presence in the C-store channel. Third, we must aggressively develop our global presence, which starts with reigniting growth in our international business. Fiscal 2023 was a particularly challenging year for our international business due to softness in China, weak commodity markets and higher-than-expected elasticities on our branded export business. While results in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 are assumed to remain challenged, we anticipate a steady recovery beginning in the second quarter. In fiscal 2024, we expect to benefit from more normalized shipments of SPAM to the Philippines, and easing of headwinds in our commodity businesses and recovery in China. As the near-term headwinds abate, we anticipate this business to resume delivering accelerated growth. Fourth, we must execute our enterprise-wide entertaining and snacking vision by unlocking the power of our brands across the channels where we compete.\nWe are positioned to win in this on-trend category with brands such as Planters, Corn Nuts, Hormel Pepperoni, Columbus and HORMEL GATHERINGS. We have been pleased with the momentum we have built in the back half of the year for the Planters business. Data for the latest quarter shows accelerating dollar and unit sales. In addition to share household penetration and distribution gains. Much of this momentum is being driven by innovation. Our new flavored cash use line is meeting or exceeding expectations in the marketplace. Over-indexing with millennial consumers, growing household penetration and introducing new consumers to the category. To capitalize on this success, we are launching another flavored cashew variety in fiscal [ 2024 ] in addition to a slate of new-to-market innovations. We have aggressive plans to keep the momentum going for our Planter Snack Nuts business in fiscal 2024, led by further innovation new distribution, brand investments and effective promotional support. We continue to do our part as the category leader to support the planters and corn nuts brands to drive growth for our business, the category and for our customers.\nFifth, we must future fit our one supply chain. Which means reducing costs and minimizing complexity while investing in long-term growth. We recently announced that we are converting the Barron Wisconsin plant which currently operates turkey harvest and value-added production lines into a value-added facility to support growth across our broader portfolio. Harvest operations are expected to cease during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. These actions at the Barron facility are consistent with the goals we laid out in late 2021 and when we first announced transformational efforts at Jennie-O Turkey Store.\nWe are committed to building a more demand-oriented and optimized Turkey portfolio that is better aligned to the changing means of our customers, consumers and operators. The actions at the Barron plant further rightsized our turkey supply chain supporting consistent top line growth, improved profitability and decreased exposure to commodity volatility. We are also committed to optimizing the Jennie-O Turkey Store system. Including freeing up plant space to support growth across the broader Hormel Foods portfolio. The Barron plant is expected to support high demand and high growth product lines across all areas of the organization we are committed to integrating the Turkey business into the broader organization to drive efficiencies and growth. Our retail, foodservice and international segments have been directly supporting the Turkey business for a year. And we anticipate this continued collaboration to drive long-term growth for the Jennie-O brand and across our entire Turkey portfolio.\nFinally, we must transform and modernize our company, which is a critical piece to our projected growth over the next 3 years. At our recent Investor Day, we detailed our plans to transform and modernize the organization. Over the next 3 years, we expect to invest approximately $250 million in implementation, personnel and project costs, including investments in capital expenditures and technology. We expect around 1/3 of this investment to be made in fiscal 2024, resulting in a modest benefit to net earnings for the year. Looking to the out years, we are targeting $200 million plus in operating income growth by fiscal 2026 and from the transformation and modernization initiative across the supply chain and portfolio optimization. To be clear, we expect a modest benefit to net earnings in 2024, which has been factored into our outlook. We expect benefits to accelerate in fiscal 2025. We expect to achieve our target in fiscal 2026, and we expect this initiative to provide significant residual benefit in fiscal years 2027 and beyond. Through transformational work, we expect to build significant capabilities for the future. This is truly exciting work for the organization.\nBefore I provide further color on our [ fiscal ] 2024 outlook, I want to briefly detail how we finished fiscal 2023. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $3.2 billion, and diluted net earnings per share were $0.36. Excluding the impact of noncash impairments and investments in transformation and modernization adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.42. As expected, our Foodservice segment finished the year strong. While the risks we identified heading to the quarter, including pricing headwinds in Turkey, lower retail volumes and continued pressures in our international business negatively impacted results. These results were in line with the low end of our revenue and adjusted diluted net earnings per share expectations.\nTurning to our outlook for fiscal 2024, we expect to drive modest volume and net sales growth for the full year. This growth is expected to come from our key categories, supported by higher brand investments and innovation. In retail, we expect higher net sales across many of our verticals, including bacon, convenient meals and proteins, global flavors, emerging brands and snacking and entertaining. We have embedded in our outlook, targeted pricing actions, a step-up innovation and higher brand support to drive volume and improve mix. In Foodservice, we are anticipating broad volume growth led by Turkey, pepperoni and bacon. In addition to higher volumes, net sales are expected to benefit from higher raw material input markets. In our international business, we expect net sales increases to be driven by the branded export business led by SPAM and Skippy and improvement in both the retail and foodservice channels in China. From a bottom line perspective, we expect growth from the foodservice and international businesses and expected decline in our retail segment.\nWhile the retail segment is expected to benefit from sales growth and improved mix, we do not anticipate this growth to overcome the significant headwind from the rapid decline in the commodity whole turkey market. For context, whole turkey prices begin calendar year 2023 at all-time highs and have since fallen below the 5-year average. We are closely monitoring sell-through of whole turkeys this holiday season as well as any potential supply impacts from HPAI, which has again affected flocks this fall. These are very unusual market dynamics, which has added additional risk and uncertainty to our outlook. Given these factors in Turkey, we have included in our outlook meaningfully lower market pricing on our high-volume whole turkey business. Similar to the dynamics we experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect earnings to decline in the first half of the year due to the impact from lower turkey markets, lower volumes in the retail segment and continued softness in our China business. We expect these pressures to have the greatest impact in the first quarter. Taking all these factors into account, we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%. Diluted net earnings per share to be $1.43 to $1.57 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $1.51 to $1.65. And and we expect a modest benefit to net earnings from our transformation and modernization initiative.\nAs I alluded to earlier, we have embarked on an initiative to return the business to its historical earnings trajectory and deliver on the commitment we made at our Investor Day. To reiterate the key elements of this initiative. In fiscal 2024, we expect a year of investment, which sums underlying growth across many parts of our current business, offset by a significant headwind from Turkey higher salaries and normalized employee-related expenses, the impact from our new labor agreement and higher support for our leading brands. It also assumes investments into our transformation and modernization initiative, resulting in a modest benefit to the year, and it assumes capturing incremental value from planters, our Turkey business integration go forward and the investments we've made in additional capacity. In fiscal 2025, we expect to accelerate growth, which assumes strength from the underlying business, significant benefits from supply chain savings and portfolio optimization and further strategic value capture.\nIn fiscal 2026, we expect to deliver at least $250 million in operating income growth. As we begin 2024, we remain focused on our strategic priorities, executing our transformation and modernization initiative, fueling our innovation pipeline and exiting the year with momentum in our business segments. I remain confident that we have the right brands, strategy, people and culture could deliver on our commitment to improve our business and drive long-term shareholder returns and growth.\nIn closing, I want to recognize all the hard work carried out by our team in what was a challenging year. We successfully completed a very large reorganization, made progress addressing near-term challenges facing the business and accelerated the transformational work that will better position the company for future success. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley, to discuss detailed financial information related to fiscal 2023 and added color on key drivers to our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Full year net sales were $12.1 billion, the second highest net sales achievement in our history. We also delivered $2 billion in gross profit for the year. Full year Selling, general and administrative expenses increased compared to last year, primarily due to an adverse arbitration ruling. On an adjusted basis, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales finished comparable to the per year at 7.1%. The Advertising investments for the fiscal 2023 year were $160 million compared to $157 million last year. We have planned another increase in advertising investment in fiscal 2024 as we continue to support our leading brands in the marketplace. For fiscal 2023, equity and earnings of affiliates increased due to significantly higher results from MegaMex Foods. Operating income for fiscal 2023 was $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion. Operating margin and adjusted operating margins were 8.9% and 9.8%, respectively. The tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 21.8%, marginally higher than last year. The effective rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be 21% to 23%. For the full year, diluted net earnings per share were $1.45. Excluding the impacts of an adverse arbitration ruling noncash impairments and the investments in our transformation and monetization initiative. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.61.\nWe remain committed to dividend growth, investing in our business and maintaining an investment grading. Our consistent cash flows of more than $1 billion in fiscal 2023 and a disciplined financial strategy directly support these commitments. In fiscal 2023, we returned a record $593 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends, including payment over 381st consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15. We also recently announced an increase in the annual dividend of 3% and to $1.13 per share for fiscal 2024. This year will be a remarkable 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. We invested $270 million in capital projects during fiscal 2023, supporting growth for SPAM and for retail and food service Peperoni. We are investing $80 million in capital projects for fiscal 2024, which includes investments in our Baron facility, investments supporting our transformation and modernization initiative and to support high-demand planters items.\nWhile 2023, a was a challenging year for the company. Our strong financial position allowed us to continue sharing our successes, which included recognizing our team members for the [ 85th ] consecutive year through our annual profit-sharing program. We ended the year with $3.3 billion of debt and over $750 million in cash and short-term securities. We remain in line with our stated goal of 1.5 to 2x net debt to EBITDA.\nBefore turning to our outlook, I would like to highlight the progress we made during the year reducing inventory. As we committed to earlier in the year, we achieved our days sales in inventory target of less than 60 days for the quarter and drove a sequential reduction in dollars of both finished goods and total inventory. Inventories finished the year at $1.7 billion, a decrease of $36 million from the beginning of the year. We enter fiscal 2024 with responsible levels of inventory to support and achieve our targeted fill rates with ample production capacity to grow the businesses. While Jim covered many of the puts and takes embedded in our fiscal 2024 outlook, I want to provide additional color around our investments in the business and assumptions on key raw material markets. We are investing for growth in fiscal 2024. Specifically, we will be investing in end-to-end planning capabilities infrastructure and software to further our data and analytics capabilities, a modernization of our order to [ Carsten ] and incremental head count to support the plan, buy, make and move work streams across our supply chain. We anticipate about 1/3 of the total investment to be recorded in fiscal 2024. About $0.08 EPS is expected to be onetime with the rest capitalized or included in the ongoing cost structure of the business.\nShifting to the cost environment, our fiscal 2024 outlook assumes pork input costs to be higher than last year and to remain above the 5-year average. The USDA is projecting modestly higher production and high exports in 2024. Additionally, cold storage level [indiscernible] work have trended lower year-over-year and compared to the historical averages, which we expect to be supportive of pork markets. Of note, these costs are expected to continue to be a headwind in fiscal 2024 as the industry cycles through lower supplies. Turkey sales and volumes continued to recover in the fourth quarter as we grew Turkey volumes in each of our segments. The investments behind our value-added Turkey portfolio and lean ground business are working with ground volume and dollar sales outpacing the category for the latest 4- and 13-week period.\nTurkey markets continued to move lower during the fourth quarter, pressuring prices across our channels. We have assumed prices will remain depressed in our fiscal 2024 outlook. We do expect to partially offset these pricing headwinds with lower feed costs. HPA has reemerged again this fall, creating another unusual event affecting our vertically integrated supply chain. At the present time, we do not expect supply impacts to the degree we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2023. The situation remains fluid, and the risk of additional cases creates [indiscernible] level of uncertainty in the outlook of our Turkey business.\nIn closing, I too want to recognize the dedication and hard work of our 20,000 employees across our great company. In so many ways, our team rose to the challenges thrown at them. while continuing to deliver safe and trusted products to customers, consumers and operators. As Jim noted, I am to confirm that we officially our safest year in the history of the company, a testament to all team members who update the safety first culture and keep it at the forefront of our business. This is a key part of the continued success of the company, one that can never be taken lightly. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. In an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment, we grew volume across all our segments, delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share in line with last year and made further progress addressing the near-term challenges impacting the business during the quarter. This progress included reducing inventory, continuing to build momentum in the Planter snack nuts business and driving adjusted operating margin improvement compared to last year.\nReducing inventory to more historical levels remains a top priority for the company. Our actions to rectify the inefficiencies caused by elevated inventory are working, demonstrated by a sequential reduction in dollars of both finished goods and total inventory.\nThe value of finished goods inventory ended the quarter at its lowest level since the same time last year, representing meaningful improvement. We expect further declines in the fourth quarter and also plan to achieve our day sales and inventory target by the end of the year.\nWe also drove improvement in our Planters business, supported by another quarter of higher shipments and positive results in consumption data. For the quarter, retail shipments of Planter snack nuts and core nuts varieties were up 5% and 24%, respectively. Retail data shows dollar consumption and share improving sequentially for the last 52, 26 and 13-week periods. Volume trends remain encouraging as well with above category performance over the last 6 months. And more recent data shows Planters volume and dollar shares have inflected into positive territory.\nThe launch of our innovative flavored cashews is meeting expectations, and we are seeing strong acceptance from our customers. While early, our flavored cashews are overindexing with younger consumers as we see the benefits of leveraging our brand equity to drive excitement for the category. We are supporting the launch with social and digital activities as well as a national TV ad campaign. And we recently launched an LTO for the fall season, Apple Cider Donut flavored cashews which we expect to drive incremental volume and attention for the category.\nMomentum continues to build in our snack nuts business as we benefit from regained distribution, investments in innovation and effective promotional support. We continue to do our part as the category leader to support the Planters and core nuts brands to drive growth for our business, the snack nuts category and for our customers.\nLastly, we continue to make progress in improving our margin structure with adjusted operating margin slightly ahead of last year. Margins benefited from demand for our premium items in Foodservice and growth from the retail SPAM and Black Label bacon portfolios, areas we have invested in heavily over the past 3 years. We also more than overcame the positive mix impact from strong Skippy sales in turkey markets last year, as well as a 15% increase in advertising investments to support our brands during the third quarter. We expect our highest operating margins of the year in the fourth quarter aided by a seasonally strong sales mix and savings from a series of projects aimed at reducing costs and complexity throughout our system.\nOur third quarter results reflect the strength of our leading brands and the value of our balanced business model. Investments into our brands and continued improvement across our supply chain have generated positive performance in the marketplace. Volume growth for the quarter was broad-based, driven by a recovery in turkey, elevated demand for many of our Foodservice items, and growth from leading retail brands, including SPAM, Black Label, Planters and Hormel Pepperoni.\nOn an adjusted basis, diluted net earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40, even to last year. Compared to our outlook heading into the quarter, we absorbed unexpected earnings headwinds of $0.02 to $0.03, resulting from much weaker results in our International segment and supply chain disruption caused by a third-party logistics provider shutdown.\nLooking to our segments, our Foodservice segment delivered balanced volume gains and another quarter of segment profit growth. Volume for the quarter increased, driven by growth in our affiliated businesses and strong demand in many branded categories, including pizza toppings, premium bacon and breakfast sausage and premium prepared proteins, brands such as Cafe H, Fire Braised, Fontanini, Old Smokehouse and Bacon 1 delivered volume gains compared to the prior year.\nNet sales declined 3% due to lower market-driven pricing. For context, the average selling price per pound decreased 5% compared to last year, resulting from input cost deflation. As anticipated, our Foodservice business leveraged its differentiated capabilities to drive double-digit segment profit growth, led by better volumes and improved mix. Our team continues to successfully manage pricing and cost dynamics. They continue to actively engage with operators through our direct selling model and they continue to innovate to address key operational issues such as labor, prep time and complexity.\nIndustry data from [ Technomic ] is also supportive of growth for our business, with operator sentiment steady, industry employment improving and dollar sales increasing. Inflation in the channel has also slowed for the fourth consecutive month. We expect a strong finish to the year from this team, driven by growth from premium items, further recovery in turkey, and as the team leverages its capabilities in the K-12 and college and university channels this fall.\nIn our Retail segment, we grew volume in key categories and saw a recovery across the turkey portfolio. For the quarter, we delivered volume growth in 4 of our 6 retail verticals. And those verticals were value-added meats, bacon, snacking and entertaining and emerging brands. Volume and net sales improved for the value-added meats vertical, primarily due to higher turkey volumes. The team is heavily focused on regaining distribution of our value-added Jennie-O products and managing turkey supply through the current recovery period and upcoming holiday season.\nThe bacon vertical again delivered excellent results due to elevated demand for Black Label items and favorable input costs for most of the quarter. Over the last 52 weeks, Black Label bacon has grown share in household penetration by 1 point each. Our strategy to offer a wide variety of both raw and pre-cooked items in the marketplace has been successful, as we grow our business in the large and highly relevant bacon category. Our team is executing our brand strategy while maneuvering through the market volatility we are currently experiencing.\nVolume gains for the snacking and entertainment vertical were led by Planters snack nuts, Corn Nuts corn kernels, Hormel Pepperoni and Hormel Gatherings Party Trays. In addition to improvement for the Planters snack nuts business, our pepperoni and Hormel Gatherings businesses are healthy, demonstrated by household penetration gains for these brands during the quarter. We expect holiday demand and promotional support to drive a strong end of the year for the Planters, Hormel Gatherings and Columbus brands.\nOur Applegate business posted another quarter of volume and net sales growth, led by our frozen line of breaded chicken and breakfast sausage. Many products also outpaced category dollar sales growth during the quarter, including breaded chicken, breakfast sausage, bacon and hotdogs. The team also introduced Applegate naturals for [ Tatabytes ], the industry's first and only certified humane frozen [ egg ] bites.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect to benefit from expanded distribution for the Applegate brand and from new capacity to support our popular line of frozen breakfast sausage. Net sales of global flavors items were comparable to last year, while pricing actions, operational gains and favorable input costs on avocados drove equity and earnings improvement for our MegaMex business. The Herdez brand remains relevant with consumers, outpacing category growth for dollar and volume sales in La Salsa, taco sauce, hot sauce, refrigerated guacamole and refrigerated salsa categories.\nConvenient meals and proteins net sales declined as higher sales to SPAM varieties and Hormel [ Gilly ] were more than offset by the difficult comparison from high levels of demand for Skippy spreads last year. We continue to gain distribution on both innovative and core items during the quarter, which helped alleviate some of this pressure.\nIn the fourth quarter, we have numerous programs in place to engage consumers at the store level and online with reminders of the value offered by our products. These efforts are expected to help offset the impact of elasticities and as consumers utilize their pantry supplies. We also secured additional capacity for Skippy peanut butter which should help meet the elevated levels of demand we continue to see.\nSegment profit for the Retail segment declined due to unfavorable mix and increased brand investments partially offset by the impact from pricing actions across the portfolio, improved bacon volume and higher equity and earnings from MegaMex. Our Retail business is benefiting from market share gains innovation, new distribution, higher fill rates in key categories and effective advertising and brand support. However, there remains volume pressure in many categories across the store. Strong execution this fall and holiday season will be key to delivering our outlook.\nOur International segment remained challenged during the third quarter and the inflection we expected in this business did not materialize. Segment profit declined significantly due to unfavorable pork and turkey commodity markets, softness in China and lower branded export demand. Commodity fresh pork and turkey volumes were strong during the quarter, though depressed pricing led to weaker mix, especially on turkey items. The commodity environment is expected to remain unfavorable for the balance of the year due to high inventories of freezer stocks in key export markets.\nIn China, Foodservice sales improved sequentially throughout the quarter, growing 14% compared to last year. However, retail sales remained soft as we lapped difficult comparisons to last year and as consumer demand in the retail channel slowed considerably. Near term, we expect our Foodservice business in China to grow, which should help to offset continued softness in the retail channel. Lower retail sales are anticipated to have a negative impact on China's profitability for the remainder of the year.\nAs we've reiterated over the past few quarters, our strategy is to grow our global brands, multinational businesses in China and Brazil and partnerships around the world are sound. Our international team is confident that these situational dynamics will abate, allowing for our teams to resume delivering accelerated growth.\nTurning to our outlook. We remain focused on driving volume and earnings growth as well as delivering on our commitments to improve our business. The operating environment domestically and abroad continues to be dynamic and we anticipate consumers and operators to remain highly intentional in their spending. Our broad portfolio of products and diversified channel exposure position us well in this regard.\nAs we close the year, we expect a strong finish from our Foodservice segment, incremental savings from a series of projects aimed at reducing cost and complexity throughout our system and further synergies from our implementation of Go Forward. Additionally, we expect continued softness in our International segment and earnings pressure from heightened competition at Retail. We are assuming increased promotional activity this fall in the retail channel as consumer demand moderates to more historical levels and as industry-wide supply chains continue to improve. We also expect an impact from resumed student loan payments, which could pressure overall consumer spending in the U.S.\nTaking these factors and our performance to date into account, we are providing fourth quarter guidance and an updated outlook for fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter, we expect modest volume growth, which assumes growth from the Foodservice segment, continued recovery in turkey and improved fill rates in key categories. Fourth quarter net sales are expected to be between $3.1 billion and $3.6 billion, reflecting our current assumptions for raw material input costs in the fourth quarter. Full year net sales are expected to be down 4% to flat. We expect fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share to be down from last year, which accounts for continued weakness in the International segment and lower retail segment results.\nFull year diluted net earnings per share are expected to be $1.51 to $1.57 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share are expected to be $1.61 to $1.67. We believe our continued investments into our brands, disciplined financial strategy and balanced approach across our businesses position us well for future growth as we close a challenging 2023.\nAt our upcoming Investor Day, we plan to provide an update on our fourth quarter assumptions and outlook and further detail on how our investments and transformational efforts as a global branded food company are expected to drive earnings growth in the future. We look forward to hosting many of you in person at our mid-October event. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the third quarter and additional color on key drivers to our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we delivered volume growth across all of our segments and net sales of $3 billion. Our businesses benefited from higher turkey supplies and continued improvement across our supply chain.\nThird quarter gross profit was $498 million. Gross margins for the third quarter increased compared to last year and improved 30 basis points sequentially compared to the second quarter. SG&A expenses increased compared to last year due to a $70 million accrual resulting from an unexpected unfavorable arbitration ruling. Adjusted SG&A expenses were in line with last year. Advertising investments were $43 million during the quarter, up 15% compared to last year, as we supported our leading brands in the marketplace.\nWe expect full year advertising expenses to increase compared to the prior year. Equity and earnings of affiliates for the third quarter increased compared to last year due to higher results from MegaMex. Operating income for the third quarter was $217 million, and adjusted operating income was $287 million, 1% lower than last year.\nAs Jim noted in his remarks, operating income was negatively impacted by supply chain disruption caused by third-party logistics provider shutdown. Our teams did an excellent job diverting products through other distribution centers during this brief period, though we absorbed an impact from shortages, incremental logistics costs and elevated levels of distressed inventory.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.7% compared to 24.5% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to favorable adjustments related to our fiscal 2022 federal tax return filing. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be 21% to 23%.\nThe net result of all these factors was diluted net earnings per share of $0.30 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.40, which was comparable to last year. We generated strong cash flow compared to last year. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $317 million, up 70%. This improvement was driven by favorable working capital adjustments.\nWe paid our 380th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15 at an annual rate of $1.10 per share. This completes the 95th year of uninterrupted dividend payments to our shareholders. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $78 million compared to $61 million last year. We're targeting $280 million in capital projects as we prioritize investments in growth, innovation, cost savings, automation and maintenance.\nWe have updated our net sales and diluted net earnings per share outlook for the year. As a reminder, our diluted net earnings per share outlook reflects an adverse arbitration ruling of $0.10 per share. We said last quarter that growth in the back half would be partially dependent on the recovery in our International segment. While this dynamic has not played out as anticipated, the near-term drivers for our business continue to be: successful execution against our plans for the Planter snack nuts business; improvement across the supply chain, including delivering on our internal cost reduction goals; year-over-year favorability in commodity and freight markets; and a recovery in turkey volumes.\nIn addition to the innovation, promotional and advertising support for the Planters business that are expected to positively impact the fourth quarter, we have several work streams underway to drive further improvement in future periods. These work streams encompass all aspects of the value chain and place a heavy emphasis on enhancing mix and expanding margins. The Planters business remains key to our long-term growth as a company and we will continue to invest in and resource the business accordingly.\nPerformance across our supply chain continues to improve, demonstrated by another quarter of higher fill rates, progress on our commitment to lower inventory and execution on our cost reduction targets. Our team has committed to several projects aimed at reducing cost and complexity to improve our margin structure. In the fourth quarter, we expect to realize incremental freight and indirect supply savings and benefits from our above historical run rate on our legacy cost mitigation efforts.\nLonger term, we are committed to advancing the supply chain work stream of Project Orion and a series of multiyear projects aimed at unlocking earnings growth. We plan to provide more detail on these large-scale strategic projects at our Investor Day in October.\nWe have seen market stabilization across many inputs, though key pork raw material commodity markets were volatile throughout the third quarter. The USDA composite cutout increased more than 40% sequentially during the quarter, primarily driven by strength in the belly, loin and ham [ primal ].\nTo start the fourth quarter, pork costs have begun to moderate seasonally. And we expect lower pork input costs compared to the prior year. We began to see a volume recovery in turkey during the third quarter, and we expect to see higher year-over-year turkey volumes in the fourth quarter. To further support our recovery, we have invested in incremental advertising to drive consumer awareness and engagement in the retail channel. We're beginning to see signs of these actions paying off, especially for the important lean ground category.\nTurkey market continued to move lower in the third quarter as a result of increased supply which is pressuring prices across our channels. Pricing is down considerably on commodity items and for breast meat entering the Foodservice and deli channels.\nImportantly, we're producing a full assortment of turkey items, and our teams are selling with confidence in the retail food service and international markets. This bodes well for the long-term outlook for turkey, which remains an important part of our balanced portfolio.\nIn closing, I want to specifically acknowledge our production professionals across the organization for their continued focus on safety. Their dedication is critical to the success of our company and the primary reason we remain on track for one of our safest years ever. Safety first is a cultural belief, it's nonnegotiable and represents an integral part of our company's fabric. We are proud of our track record and the work done each day to maintain our standard of excellence. Thank you to all our team members who uphold our safety-first culture. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Dahlstrom, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid W. Dahlstrom\n\nDirector of IR, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nGood morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. We released our results this morning before the market opened, around 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.

Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which can be accessed at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.\n\nJames P. Snee\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Hormel Foods Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We had clear priorities heading into the second quarter, and our results demonstrate our team's ability to execute on those commitments, deliver results in line with our expectations for the quarter and most importantly, keep us on track to drive growth in the back half of the year. Before I dive deeper into our quarterly results and reaffirmed outlook for the year, I want to start this morning by providing an update on the progress we have made addressing inventory levels, improving our margin structure, stabilizing the Planters business and continuing the implementation of our GoFWD operating level.\nFirst, I'd like to discuss the progress we made rectifying the inefficiencies caused by elevated inventory levels. This was a top priority in the company during the second quarter, and we took immediate actions to sell excess nonproductive inventories to slow manufacturing in areas where supply was exceeding demand to bring back outside production into our facilities, allowing us to better utilize new and available internal capacity, and we implemented several changes to our demand and supply planning processes. As anticipated, these actions had a margin impact during the quarter, but were necessary to bring inventory levels into greater balance.\nFor the back half of the year, we have further plans in place to responsibly manage and lower inventory levels and all costs associated with these actions are accounted for in the outlook. As a result, we expect to begin fiscal 2024 with benefits from better process control, lower freight and warehousing expenses, lower distressed sales and higher investment income resulting from an improvement in our cash cycle. Second, we continue to make progress improving our margin structure as evidenced by a sequential increase in operating margins during the quarter, even with our actions to reduce elevated inventory levels. In addition to managing costs and driving supply chain savings through continuous improvement programs, our inflation-justified pricing actions are leading to gradual margin improvement.\nWe have announced targeted pricing actions effective at the end of the third quarter on additional retail items and are evaluating further pricing actions accordingly. Another way we are actively improving our margin structure is by optimizing promotional and advertising spend. We demonstrated that discipline this quarter by responsibly shifting some advertising spend to promotions, working with our retail partners to drive the best returns for our leading brands and growing the categories in which they compete. We are still expecting a year-over-year increase in advertising spend to support our leading brands. Specific to the second half of the year, our teams are focused on several projects aimed at reducing cost and complexity to further improve our margin structure, and we expect to see a return from some of these projects by the fourth quarter.\nThird, we took action to improve the Planters business. During the second quarter, we regained significant distribution and placements for the Planters brand, which started shipping at the end of the second quarter. We introduced much-needed innovation to the category with flavored cashews and new core nuts varieties. And we shifted promotional resources to drive consumption for the Planters brand. The brand saw shipments increase 8% for the quarter, aided in part by the strong promotional execution. While early, data for the latest 13-week period on a volume basis indicates that the Planters brand is outpacing the packaged nuts and seeds category and is showing positive takeaway growth for peanuts and cashews.\nThis summer, we are also running a national campaign for our new flavored cashews to maintain momentum for this business. Our progress during the second quarter represents a positive proof point in the turnaround for Planters. Planters remains at the center of our snacking and entertaining strategy, and we are fully committed to the Planters brand [ core nut ] brand and the snack nuts category. We know what we need to do to change the trajectory of the business and our teams are focused on accelerating the pace of change. Finally, we made further progress implementing the GoFWD operating model and standing up our brand fuel center of excellence. With the structure now mostly in place, we can better resource other long-term projects including advancing the supply chain work stream of Project Orion. We temporarily scaled back some work streams as we prioritize the integration of the Planter snack nuts business, our transformational actions at JENNIE-O turkey store and the implementation of GoFWD.\nThe supply chain work stream represents some of the most important and highest return deliverables on the entire Project Orion roadmap. We have also kicked off a series of multiyear projects such as a modernization of our order-to-cash system improvements to the end-to-end planning processes and a pilot project to implement new ways of working across the manufacturing network. We plan to provide more detail on these large-scale and strategic projects as well as our continued evolution as a global branded food company at our Investor Day in October. Results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. From a top line perspective, sales declined 4% on a volume reduction of 6%. Volume declines were largely attributed to impacts across the turkey supply chain due to highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI in our supply chain last fall.\nIn addition to the large headwind from turkey, net sales were negatively affected by significant pork deflation during the quarter. This has the most profound effect on the retail bacon and Foodservice value-added portfolios. Diluted net earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40. Earnings headwinds were understood heading into the quarter and included strategic investments to stabilize the Planters business, margin impact related to our actions to address inventory levels, challenging operating conditions in China, lower turkey sales, higher feed and pension costs and a higher tax rate. Turning to the segments. Strong bottom line growth from the Foodservice segment during the quarter and the benefit from cost relief in certain areas was offset by lower results from the Retail and International segments.\nAgain, this quarter, we leveraged our long-standing relationships, differentiated product portfolio and direct sales team to drive growth for our Foodservice business. Volume and net sales growth in the sliced meats, pizza toppings and premium breakfast sausage categories was more than offset by the impact of lower turkey volumes and lower net pricing, reflecting raw material commodity deflation. Our Foodservice business remains extremely well positioned. We have available capacity to regain business lost over the last 3 years due to constrained supply, especially in key categories such as bacon and pizza toppings.\nWe will also continue to lean into our world-class culinary team, innovative items and food forward mentality, all which further differentiate our business from the competition. At retail, we benefited from pricing actions and the strength of our leading brands, helping to partially offset the impact of unfavorable mix and higher operating costs. During the quarter, net sales growth from the global flavors vertical was more than offset by lower net sales across the other retail verticals. Like the Foodservice segment, the impact of lower turkey volumes and lower bacon pricing were the primary drivers of lower top line results as elasticities played out better than expected in most categories.\nThe MegaMex business housed in our global flavors vertical had another strong quarter. Net sales growth was led by the WHOLLY, La Victoria and Herdez brands. The pricing actions we have taken across this business to combat inflationary pressures, coupled with commodity relief on avocado inputs are leading to significant year-over-year gains in equity and earnings. Elasticities on this portfolio remain favorable and we expect to benefit from continued distribution gains from our innovation pipeline, including Herdez [indiscernible] and refrigerated sauces. The bacon vertical also delivered another quarter of outstanding results due to strong demand for Black Label items and lower belly prices.\nBlack Label raw bacon takeaway for the quarter exceeded 20% in volume sales. We are executing extremely well in the bacon category and anticipate continued growth in market share and household penetration, while benefiting from cost favorability. The convenient meals and protein verticals saw sales growth from many of its branded products, including Chili, SKIPPY peanut butter, Square Table, refrigerated entrees, Dinty Moore stew and Mary Kitchen hash. Overall net sales for the vertical declined due to lower contract manufacturing results as we prioritize higher-margin branded businesses. The convenient meals and proteins business has secured additional customer distribution for the back half of the year. And our categories, brands and household penetration growth trends remain favorable. Net sales declined for the snacking and entertaining vertical, primarily due to strong promotional activity for the Columbus brand last year. Planters branded volume increased 8% for the quarter while the Hormel pepperoni and Hormel gatherings brands grew net sales double digits compared to the previous year.\nAs noted earlier, we expect to continue to benefit from favorable customer resets for the Planters business and from distribution gains on our pepperoni items in the back half of the year. In the emerging brands vertical, Applegate drove growth for its frozen breaded chicken and breakfast sausage items. And the Applegate business continued to diversify its channel exposure, which is key to its long-term growth. Distribution gains in the mass channel and the strength of its e-commerce business are helping offset some weaknesses in the natural and organic channel. The final vertical, value-added meats was most heavily affected by lower turkey availability, leading to volume and net sales declines. We expect a strong finish to the year from this vertical due to higher JENNIE-O turkey volumes and positive trends in the [indiscernible].\nThe retail environment remains extremely competitive and the benefits we've seen from GoFWD to better focus and resource our teams position us well to deliver our plans in the second half of the year. While the International segment remained challenged, the team drove excellent growth for the SKIPPY and Planters brands as well as another quarter of growth from the team in Brazil. Segment profit declined significantly due to lower sales in China and lower turkey export sales. In China, Foodservice sales improved sequentially throughout the quarter, helping offset the difficult comparison to retail pantry loading and sales to food security programs last year.\nThough we have seen an acceleration in our Foodservice business, a recovery in our retail business following the COVID-related policy changes earlier in the year has been slower than anticipated. The team in China has aggressive plans in place to drive improved results in the back half of the year. Limited commodity turkey supplies and restrictions on turkey exports continued to affect results as export turkey volumes declined 50% compared to last year. With the rebound in turkey supplies, we expect this headwind to lessen in magnitude in the back half of the year. The second quarter also marked the first full quarter of minority ownership in Garudafood, one of the largest food and beverage companies in Indonesia.\nGarudafood delivered returns in line with expectations during the quarter, and we look forward to further leveraging the strengths and capabilities of both companies to expand the business in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. International business is structurally sound and increasingly balanced. We are confident that the near-term dynamics will gradually abate, allowing our teams to resume delivering accelerated growth. We expect sequential improvement in the back half of the year on contributions from our branded exports, multinational businesses and partnerships around the world. Finally, it's important to note that we are experiencing a direct benefit from our multiyear efforts to align resources to value-added platforms and reduce exposure to commodity businesses.\nSince 2017, we have made many decisions to align our pork supply chain to the long-term trends of the industry, guarantee supply for our value-added businesses and reduce the earnings volatility from commodity exposure.\nIn this difficult commodity environment, we have benefited as a net buyer of trim and bellies. So we have absorbed significant losses on our harvest operations like others in the industry. We will continue to monitor long-term industry trends and where necessary, make adjustments that are supportive of our value-added growth strategies and our long-standing partnerships throughout the supply chain. Shifting to our outlook. We expect sales and earnings growth in the back half of the year. Growth from the Foodservice segment and an inflection in the International segment are expected to be the primary drivers of year-over-year gains.\nAll the businesses are expected to benefit from a rebound in turkey volumes and improved fill rates in key categories such as bacon, pepperoni, snack nuts, and for our SPAM family of products. Coupled with the progress we have made on GoFWD, including standing up brand fuel, restructuring our sales teams and resourcing the marketing teams to better support our leading brands, we remain confident in our growth outlook as we continue to meet the needs of our customers, consumers and operators. On a related front, we have made significant commitments and investments to ready the business to serve our customers in California.\nAs of January 2022, we have been [ Prop 12 ] compliant on a portion of our pork supply, absorbing the cost of compliance in our operations since that time. As we begin serving the important California market under new regulations later this month, we expect to begin recovering the cost from these investments. Considering these factors, we are reaffirming our full year net sales and diluted net earnings per share guidance ranges. We expect net sales growth of 1% to 3% and diluted net earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.82. We are encouraged by the progress we have made and our team's sense of urgency to address the near-term challenges impacting the business. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the second quarter and additional color on key drivers to our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nGroup VP of Corporate Strategy, Executive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the second quarter were $3 billion. In the second half, the negative top line headwinds from our new pork supply agreement and the beginning of HPAI last year will have fully annualized. We expect a strong volume rebound in our turkey business in the back half of the year. Second quarter gross profit was $491 million. The benefit from pricing actions was more than offset by unfavorable mix and higher expenses. For the second quarter, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 7.1% from 7.3%. Through the first half of the year, SG&A as a percentage of net sales is in line with last year, demonstrating our disciplined cost management.\nAdvertising investments were $35 million during the quarter as we continued to support our leading brands in the marketplace. We expect full year advertising expenses to increase compared to the prior year. Equity and earnings of affiliates from the second quarter increased significantly compared to last year due to improved results from MegaMex. Operating income for the second quarter was $296 million. Operating margins of 9.9% improved from 9.7% in the first quarter. Net unallocated expenses in the second quarter increased 6% due to higher pension costs, which were partially offset by improved rabbi trust investment results.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter moved higher to 22.1% compared to 18.7% last year. As anticipated, we did not repeat last year's favorable rate, which reflected higher stock option exercises. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be 21% to 23%. The net result of all these factors was diluted net earnings per share of $0.40. Turning to cash flows and capital allocation. Our financial position remains an area of strength, allowing us to satisfy our required strategic and opportunistic uses of cash. Operating cash flow was $208 million for the second quarter compared to $193 million last year, an 8% increase.\nWe paid our 379th consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15 at an annual rate of $1.10 per share, a 6% increase over last year. We also announced our August dividend payment earlier last week, which will represent [ 95 ] years of uninterrupted dividend payments to our shareholders. We are now targeting [ $280 ] million in capital projects, which is in line with our historical investment in CapEx. We continue to prioritize investments in capacity for growth, innovation, cost savings, automation and maintenance. Our current net leverage ratio remains within our stated goal of 1.5 to 2x. As a reminder, our next debt payment is due June of 2024.\nIn April, we made an additional $15 million investment in Garudafood, bringing our minority ownership from approximately 29% to 30%. As noted last quarter, we do not expect the investment in Garudafood to have a material financial impact on fiscal 2023 results. Finished products inventory increased 1% compared to the first quarter as our actions to mitigate the impacts from higher inventory levels were offset by inventory build for SPAM promotions later this summer and as we restore SKIPPY inventories to healthy levels. As we responsibly work through higher inventory levels over the balance of the year, we expect a reduction in nonproductive inventory levels for days sales and inventory to return to a normalized range below 60 days.\nLastly, we repurchased 310,000 shares for $12 million during the quarter. We will continue to repurchase shares opportunistically based on our internal valuation with authorization to purchase roughly 3.7 million additional shares. As Jim detailed, we are reaffirming our net sales and diluted net earnings per share outlook for the year. In addition to successful execution against our plan for the Planter snack nut business and the recovery in China, growth for the balance of the year is dependent on continued improvement across the supply chain, including delivering on our internal cost reduction goals, year-over-year favorability in commodity and freight markets and a strong recovery in turkey volumes.\nIn the second quarter, our fill rates saw a meaningful improvement and are now exceeding 95% across the domestic businesses. With this came higher service levels and the financial benefit from on-time deliveries, a credit to our supply chain team and the strategic investments we have made in our business. I'm also proud to report that we remain on track for one of the safest years in our company's history. As Jim noted, our team has also committed to several projects aimed at reducing cost and complexity to improve our margin structure. These projects span many areas of the supply chain, including procurement, manufacturing and logistics to accelerate, identify and capture cost savings opportunities.\nSpecific to the back half of the year, we are assuming incremental freight and indirect supply savings and a higher than historical run rate from our legacy cost mitigation efforts. Signs of continued market stabilization and cost relief in areas such as raw materials and freight are also supportive of our gradual margin improvement for the business. As expected, prices on key protein inputs during the second quarter generally declined compared to last year and the first quarter. The USDA composite cutout declined 23% compared to last year and was 7% lower than the first quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by bellies, which declined 50% compared to last year. Trim prices are also trending lower than the prior year and declined counter seasonally heading into Memorial Day.\nThe full financial impact of more favorable raw material prices will continue to lag as we work through the elevated inventory and absorb higher [ grains ] and beef costs. We have assumed lower freight expenses in the back half of the year due to the actions of the supply chain team, softening industry demand for trucks and increased carrier capacity. Driver participation is above pre-COVID levels and has remained stable. These savings will be partially offset by continued headwinds from warehousing expenses as industry-wide cold storage constraints persist. The overall impact of HPAI on domestic poultry supply chain in the U.S. this spring was minimal. The risk associated with the return of the virus now appear to be low heading into the summer months.\nTurkey markets moved lower in the second quarter and have continued to decline due to a rapid recovery in supply. We are again producing full assortment of turkey items, and our teams are selling with confidence into the retail, foodservice and international markets. As we said last quarter, demand for JENNIE-O turkey products remains positive, and we expect improved meat availability in the back half of the year to drive higher sales volumes for our turkey business, offsetting the impact of market declines and higher fee positions. Our team is delivering on the commitments we laid out last quarter and is continuing to lead in the area of social responsibility. Recently, we were recognized as one of Barron's 100 most sustainable companies named as 1 of the top 5 conscientious CPG companies by Progressive Grocer and honored with the distinction of being named one of America's most trustworthy companies by Newsweek for the second year in a row.\nWe strive to earn and keep the trust of our customers and stakeholders every day through our actions and commitments to transparency, accountability and integrity. All of these recognitions are a testament to the dedication and hard work of our team members who are the foundation of our continued success. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to David Dahlstrom, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid W. Dahlstrom\n\nDirector of IR, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nGood morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2023. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6:30 a.m. Eastern. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.\nOn our call today is Jim Snee, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jacinth Smiley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Deanna Brady, Executive Vice President of the Retail segment. Jim will review the company's first quarter results and give a perspective on the rest of fiscal 2023. Jacinth will provide detailed financial results and further commentary on our outlook. And Deanna will join for the Q&A portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) At the conclusion of this morning's call, a webcast replay will be posted to our investor website and archived for 1 year.\nAdditionally, earlier this week, we filed a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that included supplemental segment financial information for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 related to the go-forward initiative. We have posted a copy of the Form 8-K to our investor website, investor.hormelfoods.com.\nBefore we get started, I need to reference the safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which can be accessed at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.\n\nJames P. Snee\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. With the release of our recast financial information earlier this week, our transition from a structural and reporting perspective is now complete for the go-forward initiative. I want to take time to acknowledge the immense amount of work the entire team has put in to transition the business to our new strategic operating model.\nWe have spent time discussing the strategic rationale and how our actions over the past decade have positioned us for go forward, but there has been a lot of blocking and tackling that had to take place first to get us to where we are today. Over the past 6 months, we stood up 3 new business segments and consolidated the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment.\nThis included organizing the retail segment into 6 distinct verticals and combining the foodservice businesses across the enterprise. We invested in new centers of excellence including brand fuel and a dedicated FP&A team. And we made changes to the administrative side of the business to recast the financial statements, align and structure our entities and duties, maintain controls across the business and, of course, operate our business without interruption.\nWe have learned a lot about our people, processes and technology going through this transition. While we have work to do in all of these areas, I am encouraged by the conversations that are taking place across the organization.\nThe operating environment remains challenging. And while many areas of the business performed ahead of last year during the first quarter, our results were disappointing and below our expectations.\nFrom a top line perspective, demand from consumers and operators generally remained elevated in key categories, and we delivered balanced growth between volume and price across many parts of our portfolio. We continue to see elevated demand for many of our center store refrigerated Mexican and premium items at retail, including Black Label Bacon, Columbus Charcuterie, Hormel Chili, Hormel Pepperoni, Applegate Breaded Chicken, Herdez products, Square Table entrees and Mary Kitchen hash.\nLikewise, solutions-based items in our Foodservice segment had another strong quarter with volume growth in sliced meats, and from brands such as Cafe H, Fire Braised, BACON 1 and Austin Blues.\nFor the quarter, sales declined 2%. As a reminder, there continues to be volatility in our overall volume and net sales results given the planned volume declines in commodity pork and the volume impacts across the turkey supply chain due to highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI.\nDiluted net earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40, a $0.04 decline compared to last year. Our results reflect the persistent impact from inflationary pressures, supply chain inefficiencies and lower sales volumes across each of the business segments.\nNow turning to our segments. Results in the Retail segment declined compared to last year. Net sales growth from the bacon, global flavors, convenient meals and proteins and emerging brands verticals was offset by lower sales in the value-added meats and snacking and entertaining verticals.\nSegment profit declined as the benefit from pricing actions across the portfolio, higher equity and earnings from MegaMex and improved results for the bacon business were more than offset by the impact from lower net sales, unfavorable mix and higher operating costs.\nThe Bacon vertical delivered outstanding results in the quarter due to elevated demand for our Black Label items. There was also a benefit from commodity relief in pork bellies throughout the quarter as we work through higher cost inventory. This is a category where we have made significant investments and one we expect to show growth for the year.\nSimilarly, the global flavors vertical made up of our MegaMex business had an excellent start to the year. The pricing actions that we have taken across this business to combat inflationary pressures coupled with commodity relief on avocado inputs, led to revenue and equity and earnings gains for the quarter.\nThe emerging brands vertical delivered volume and sales growth for the Applegate brand led by frozen breaded chicken and wall deli items. The convenient meals and proteins vertical achieved another quarter of net sales growth, led by Hormel Chili, Square Table refrigerated entrees and Mary Kitchen hash. In addition to a benefit from pricing actions we implemented last year.\nWe will have new capacity for SPAM items beginning in the second quarter. In addition to supporting our highest selling products in the category, this new capacity allows us to restore assortments, introduce new flavors such as Maple and relaunch our 7-ounce SPAM item after a 3-year hiatus. This provides excellent value for consumers seeking a more affordable option in the category.\nSKIPPY peanut butter sales for the quarter were significantly behind last year. Last May, when we made the decision to relentlessly support our customers and the peanut butter category, we knew it would pressure inventory levels and have lingering impacts into fiscal 2023. This was the right decision for all stakeholders, and our team deserves credit for growing the peanut butter category and making the product readily available for our customers and consumers when they needed it.\nDemand remains robust for the SKIPPY brand and the category, and we are working diligently to maximize capacity and return inventories and fill rates to normalized levels.\nNet sales declined for the snacking and entertainment vertical as growth for the Columbus and Hormel Pepperoni brands was more than offset by a year-over-year decline in the snack nuts business.\nThe final vertical, value-added meats was most heavily impacted by lower commodity pork and turkey availability, leading to net sales declines.\nIn the Foodservice segment, products in the sliced meats, pepperoni, premium prepared proteins and premium bacon and breakfast sausage categories grew volume and net sales for the quarter. Like retail, the overall decline in volume was driven primarily by limited turkey and fresh pork availability. Segment profit increased for the quarter due to improved mix across the portfolio. Results for this segment were below our expectations, reflecting industry softness from mid-December into January. However, we have seen a sharp rebound in orders to begin the second quarter and are confident in our ability to grow the business this year.\nFinally, the International segment was heavily impacted by external factors during the first quarter. From a top line perspective, our branded export business had a strong quarter led by the SPAM and SKIPPY brands. We also saw another quarter of improved results in Brazil as the team continues to focus on its premium products and food service strategy.\nCommodity turkey volumes declined almost 80% compared to last year due to restrictions on turkey exports and limited supply as we strategically diverted raw material to support the domestic business.\nOur team in China faced incredibly difficult operating conditions throughout the quarter as the impact of COVID-related policy changes had dramatic short-term effects on the business as well as our employees, customers and operators. Taken together, the impact from lower turkey exports and disruptions in China represented a more than $0.01 earnings per share impact on the quarter compared to last year.\nWe are seeing improvement in China to begin the second quarter especially in our foodservice business. As conditions normalize, we expect our China business to resume delivering accelerated growth.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased a minority stake in Garuda Food, one of the largest food and beverage companies in Indonesia. This investment supports our international growth ambitions and the global execution of our snacking and entertaining strategy. Garudafood is a market leader with strong and reputable brands, local expertise and a best-in-class distribution network. We have been partnering with the Garudafood team for several years, and this strategic investment enhances that partnership. Jacinth will provide the financial details of the transaction later in the call.\nAs we disclosed earlier this morning, we are reaffirming our top line expectations and reducing our diluted net earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2023. Our top line remains healthy. And despite softness in the first quarter, we are on track to deliver growth for the year.\nDemand for our leading center store and refrigerated retail brands remains favorable. The foodservice segment expects strong growth for the remainder of the year, and we anticipate the near-term challenges impacting the international segment to abate over the coming months.\nCompared to our expectations heading into the year, earnings are being pressured by inefficiencies across the supply chain, persistent inflationary pressures and softness in the snack nuts category. I want to detail how we plan to address each of these challenges for the balance of the year.\nFirst, I would like to discuss the state of our supply chain. It is important to note that we have made progress over the last year, staffing our facilities, expanding production capacity and improving fill rates for each of our businesses. This has allowed us to catch up to demand in most categories and further supports the confidence we have in our revenue outlook for this year and longer term.\nSince the fall, we have been operating with elevated inventories due to our efforts to increase production, optimize plant performance and return fill rates to historical levels. We expected this inventory to clear during the normal course of business. This has not happened. And in fact, we have seen inventories continue to grow in a number of areas. This has resulted in inefficiencies across the supply chain and higher operating costs.\nWe are taking immediate action to combat these inefficiencies by focusing on selling excess inventories and reducing the reliance on third-party warehouses and co-packers. These actions are expected to cause short-term margin compression, but they are necessary as we look to restore profitability to normalized levels and reduce complexity.\nSimply said, after almost 3 years of chasing unprecedented demand, our ability to supply our customers, consumers and operators caught up to and in some cases began to exceed demand and we needed to react sooner. Rectifying the inefficiencies caused by elevated inventory levels is the top priority in the company.\nSecond, we continue to operate in a volatile, complex and high-cost environment and cost pressures remain high. Our retail businesses, especially in the center store, continue to be disproportionately impacted by high inflationary pressures and the pricing actions we have taken over the last 18 months still lag inflation.\nTo help mitigate some of this pressure, we have announced additional inflationary justified pricing actions in certain retail categories effective late in the second quarter. We are evaluating further pricing actions but as we have said, our teams remain highly focused on the long-term needs of the business and protecting the equity of our brands.\nFor the remainder of the year, we believe we can stabilize these margin pressures through a combination of pricing actions, operational cost management and supply chain cost savings initiatives.\nThird, after meeting expectations last year, our Planters business is off to a slower-than-expected start in 2023. There are numerous factors at play including general category softness, a consumer shift away from certain higher-priced items, production challenges and timing issues. We are taking immediate action to address the current challenges, stabilize the top line and grow the consumer base.\nBeginning in the second quarter, we are shifting resources to drive consumption. This includes increasing promotional support and prioritizing peanut items and pack sizes aimed at value-seeking consumers. We are bringing much needed innovation to the category with flavored cashews and several new corn nuts flavors.\nWe're expanding assortments as we continue to gain distribution for the brand. And we are investing in capital for higher growth items that are relevant for today's consumer. Long term, we remain fully committed to the Planters brand and the snack nuts category. This business is at the center of our snacking and entertainment strategy, our ambitions to grow in the convenience store channel and as we look to become even more balanced as a company. We know what we need to do to change the trajectory of this business and our teams are focused on accelerating the pace of that change.\nConsidering these factors, we expect full year net sales growth of 1% to 3% and diluted net earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.82 per share. While we have work to do the rest of this fiscal year, we cannot lose sight of the progress we have made over the last 2 years. We are a significantly larger company today, 30% bigger, in fact.\nWe are a more balanced company through the products we sell and in the ways we reach our customers, consumers and operators. We have transformed our company, not only through the go-forward initiative but with the investments we have continued to make in technology, capacity and capabilities. And we have made all of this progress while simultaneously navigating a dynamic and volatile environment and managing through the impacts of HPAI.\nOur brands remain vibrant and relevant. Our strategies remain effective and our business is positioned for long-term growth.\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the first quarter and additional color on key drivers to our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the first quarter were $3 billion, a 2% decline to last year. Planned lower commodity pork and turkey volumes were the primary drivers of the decrease in net sales.\nWe have now lapped our new pork supply agreement as of January and turkey supplies have improved since the fall. We anticipate more normalized volume comparisons for the remainder of the year, barring a return of HPAI in the spring.\nFirst quarter gross profit was $496 million compared to $539 million last year. Gross profit margin declined 100 basis points as the impact from pricing actions was more than offset by unfavorable mix and persistent inflationary pressures.\nFor the first quarter, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased marginally to 7.5%. The company continued to support its leading brands through advertising investments.\nAdvertising expenses were $47 million during the quarter comparable to last year. Of note, we promoted Black Label bacon over the holiday season and the Planters brand was once again front and center at this year's big game with the rose of Mr. Peanut.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates for the first quarter increased significantly compared to last year due to improved results for MegaMex and our joint venture in the Philippines.\nOperating income for the first quarter was $289 million compared to $320 million last year. Operating margins compressed to 9.7% compared to 10.5% last year. Net unallocated expenses in the first quarter increased $7 million. This increase was driven by higher employee-related expenses and outside consulting fees.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter moved modestly higher to 22.6% compared to 22.4% last year. Last year's rate reflected higher stock option exercise benefits. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 is expected to be 21% to 23%. The net result of all these factors was diluted net earnings per share of $0.40.\nTurning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $204 million for the first quarter compared to $384 million last year. This decline was driven by lower net earnings and an increase in working capital.\nAs Jim mentioned, we purchased a 29% common stock interest in Garudafood, a leading food and beverage company in Indonesia. We obtained a minority interest from various shareholders for a purchase price of $411 million, including associated transaction costs. The transaction was funded using cash on hand. We do not expect the transaction to have a material impact on our fiscal 2023 results.\nWe are targeting $350 million in capital expenditures for 2023. In addition to the newly commissioned SPAM product line, we recently approved a $40 million expansion for our Columbus line of premium charcuterie products and additional capacity for higher demand Planters items at the Fort Smith, Arkansas facility.\nWe also continue to invest heavily in automation projects as evidenced by our recently completed project supporting turkey processing at the (inaudible) Minnesota facility. The project automates more than 30 difficult, highly repetitive jobs at the plant, further aiding our efforts to improve employee retention and satisfaction.\nWe paid our 378th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $1.10 per share, a 6% increase over last year. We ended the first quarter with $3.3 billion in debt unchanged from the prior year. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating.\nAs Jim detailed, we have lowered our diluted net earnings per share outlook for the year and have action plans in place for the balance of fiscal 2023.\nIn terms of cadence for the year, we expect diluted net earnings per share in the second quarter to be significantly lower than last year. We expect unfavorable mix in the retail segment, short-term margin compression due to our immediate actions across the supply chain and for continued COVID-related disruption in China to negatively affect the second quarter. We are also not expecting a repeat of last year's lower effective tax rate.\nAs we look to the second half of the year, we expect earnings growth compared to last year led by the Foodservice and International segments, gradual improvement in the cost environment and higher turkey volumes. We are beginning to see signs of market stabilization and even cost relief in certain areas such as raw materials and freight.\nAs anticipated, prices on key protein inputs generally declined during the quarter compared to last year and the fourth quarter. The USDA composite cutout declined 19% compared to the fourth quarter and was 2% lower than last year. This decrease was driven primarily by bellies, which declined 26% compared to last year. Higher cost inventory was generally a headwind in the first quarter and will continue to affect results as we work to reduce inventories.\nWe have assumed a benefit from lower raw materials costs in the back half of the year. Similarly, we saw a more balanced freight environment during the first quarter as demand for trucks moderated. We expect freight rates for the remainder of the year to be lower compared to last year. In addition to the actions we are taking to address inventory levels and inflation, our teams remain focused on identifying and capturing cost savings opportunities as supply chain conditions normalize.\nHPAI remains a significant risk facing the business. While the last supported case in our supply chain was early December, the virus continues to impact domestic poultry supplies. There is increased risk to our supply chain into the spring as migration begins along the Mississippi flyway.\nAssuming current conditions hold, reduced production volume in our turkey facilities is expected through the end of the second quarter before steadily improving in the back half of the year. This should be supportive of our turkey business as demand for general turkey products remains strong. Turkey markets have become less favorable as breast meat prices have steadily declined over the last month. Additionally, historically high feed costs remain a headwind for our business.\nConsidering these factors, we expect to improve meat availability in the back half of the year to drive higher sales volumes for our turkey business, offsetting the impact of market declines and higher feed costs. Additionally, we made significant progress towards fully integrating Jennie-O Turkey store into the company's One Supply chain and new operating segments during the first quarter.\nWe remain on track to achieve $20 million to $30 million of savings on a run rate basis by the end of the fiscal 2023. As noted, last quarter, there were incremental investments planned against one supply chain and go forward. Our new business model demands this, and our strong financial position allows us to continue investing for the long term.\nIn closing, I want to acknowledge the demand and work of all the teams across the organization to make the go-forward initiative possible. I remain confident that once fully implemented, our new strategic operating model will better align the businesses to the needs of our customers, consumers, operators and shareholders to deliver sustainable long-term growth.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

Snee\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2022 was a return to growth for our business as we delivered record sales and double-digit earnings growth compared to last year. Fiscal 2022 marked the third consecutive year of record sales and the second most profitable year in our company's 131-year history. In addition to achieving strong year-over-year growth, our team made considerable progress on our 6 strategic priorities.\nFirst, we continued our efforts to protect and grow our core brands. Sales in our retail channel increased 7% in fiscal 2022, led by brands such as SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Natural Choice, Dinty Moore, Hormel Square Table entrees, and Mary Kitchen. Of note, the SPAM family of products achieved its eighth consecutive year of record growth.\nSecond, we made progress amplifying our presence in snacking and entertaining. We delivered excellent growth on the Columbus and Hormel Gatherings brand, and we have successfully integrated the Planters business. We have a powerhouse of brands with the goal of becoming the leading solutions provider in the snacking and entertainment space.\nThird, we saw growth from our ethnic and Food Forward portfolios. Both our MegaMex joint venture and Applegate business achieved sales milestones this fiscal year, driving growth behind the WHOLLY, Herdez and Applegate brands, respectively. These businesses are well positioned in the marketplace due to their strong and reputable brands, on-trend innovation and loyal consumer bases.\nFourth, we continue to expand our leadership position in foodservice. Sales in the foodservice channel grew 20% compared to last year as operators again turn to our items to help solve for labor pressures and to diversify menu offerings.\nWe drove excellent growth in this critically important channel, highlighted by brands such as Bacon 1, Austin Blues, Hormel Fire Braised and Café H. Our foodservice portfolio and direct selling organization remain key differentiators and growth catalysts for the company.\nFifth, we invested into our International business as we look to aggressively develop our global presence. In fiscal 2022, we commissioned a state-of-the-art innovation center supporting the Asia Pacific region and approved another capacity investment to support our growth in China. Our International business is expected to be a significant growth driver for the company.\nAnd finally, we continue to transform our company. We made noteworthy progress on our transformational efforts at Jennie-O Turkey Store and laid the groundwork for the next step in our evolution as a global branded food company, our Go Forward initiative. We also made considerable progress on our 20 by 30 Challenge.\nSome of the year's highlights included matching 100% of our domestic energy use in fiscal 2022 with renewable sourcing, remaining on track to have an approved science-based target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2023, becoming a major sponsor of up to 50,000 acre regenerative agriculture pilot project in Central and Southeast Minnesota, announcing our commitment to create a food secure community program in Austin, Minnesota, with the additional goal of sharing the blueprint and findings globally.\nWe are making a difference, thanks to the incredible work and dedication of our team members, partners and suppliers. Our team showed tremendous results to deliver growth in fiscal 2022.\nThe team overcame broad-based inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, the impacts from highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI, and numerous headwinds in our International business. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the team for their dedication, hard work and for demonstrating our results-matter mentality again this past year.\nIn the fourth quarter, our team delivered diluted earnings per share comparable with record results last year, and last year included an additional week of sales. These results further demonstrate that our brands remain healthy and the strategic investments we have made are enabling growth.\nWe achieved another quarter of organic sales growth, led by our center store grocery portfolio and solid performances from our foodservice businesses.\nSegment profit growth was due to the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment as the team again managed Turkey supply effectively and maximized operational performance. We also made progress across our supply chain to increase production capabilities and restore inventories on key product lines.\nBill rates for retail, deli and foodservice items all improved compared to last year and the third quarter. As we announced in August, we recently began transitioning our business to a new strategic operating model. As of October 31, we have moved to 3 operating segments: Retail, Foodservice and International.\nOver the last month, we have been working to create a unified retail organization with scale, experience, expertise and passion to grow our almost $8 billion portfolio of brands. We are approaching customers differently, bringing together subject-matter experts from across our businesses to find growth opportunities and execute strategies in the marketplace.\nWe are leading with a more food-forward mentality, thinking and acting differently in the ways we position our brands with consumers. This has created new opportunities that were not easily executed in our old model. And we are working with a newly created brand fuel team to ignite the potential of our products in store and on shelf. And these early successes are not limited to our retail team.\nOur combined foodservice team will further leverage the scale of Planters in the convenience store channel while assuming full control of the company's foodservice Turkey business, including the Jennie-O brand.\nThough we are only in the initial stages of the implementation, we are receiving positive responses from our customers and operators. Our immediate focus is to accelerate the execution of our 6 strategic priorities while continuing to meet the needs of our customers, consumers and operators.\nSpecific to the first quarter, our teams will be working to adopt the new organizational design, management structures and accountabilities. The teams will be working to continue the work to integrate Jennie-O Turkey Store into the company's One Supply Chain and new operating segments.\nAnd our teams will be working to stand up the Brand Fuel Center of Excellence, which will house enterprise-wide brand management expertise e-commerce capabilities, insights-led innovation and analytical support to better enable data-driven decisions.\nEarnings will be reported under this structure beginning with the release of fiscal 2023 first quarter results in early March. We will be supplying recast financial information for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 in February 2023.\nThe deliberate and thoughtful steps we have taken thus far are all about better aligning our structure with our proven strategy to create the Hormel Foods of the future. We are excited for the additional collaboration, capabilities and value we will realize from this transition and remain confident in our ability to drive long-term sustainable growth.\nTurning to our outlook. We expect to grow both sales and earnings in fiscal 2023. We enter fiscal 2023 well positioned for the current macroeconomic climate and expect top line growth from all 3 of our new segments: Retail, Foodservice and International.\nIn retail, we expect demand for our center store grocery business to remain strong as consumers continue to seek products and brands that offer high value, versatility and convenience.\nWe expect growth from Planters and the rest of our snacking and entertaining businesses, including the Columbus and Gatherings brands. Planters will be rolling out meaningful innovation throughout the year to complement and expand on the new flavor varieties and packaging introduced in fiscal 2022.\nWe expect to benefit from the investments we have made in additional Black Label Bacon and Hormel Pepperoni capacity and are excited for the new SPAM capacity to be operational in the first half of the year.\nAnd lastly, we expect a recovery in Turkey volumes in the back half of the year, allowing our teams to continue to create a demand-oriented and optimized Turkey portfolio. This is heavily dependent on any future impacts to the supply chain from HPAI. We expect that the pricing actions taken over the past few quarters should result in a benefit to net sales in fiscal 2023.\nHowever, we have also accounted for additional impacts from elasticities as these new pricing actions are adopted in the marketplace. To help mitigate risk to our retail volumes, we plan to increase advertising and brand investment, make further progress on our efforts to continue to improve fill rates and return to full assortments across our leading platforms.\nWe plan to deliver innovation across the portfolio. We'll leverage the capabilities of Go Forward, which include our well-established revenue growth management and digital experience teams, our combined direct selling organization and our newly created brand fuel team.\nIn foodservice, we are expecting another year of growth from our solutions-based portfolio and direct selling team. We entered the year from a position of strength after 2 consecutive years of robust growth during the industry recovery.\nThe consistent inroads our teams have made over time, including during previous economic slowdowns, to diversify our presence in emerging and noncommercial channels will help us navigate through future market volatility and uncertainty.\nAdditionally, the team plans to leverage the Planters and Jennie-O brands to make further gains in the convenience and [K-12] channels, respectively.\nOur International business had a challenging year in 2022, but we expect a strong return to growth in fiscal 2023. Demand for our products globally is robust, and our production capabilities and inventory levels are healthy to support this demand. We believe that many of the export challenges we experienced this past year will gradually subside.\nLike many, we are currently monitoring the situation in China. We are actively engaged with our in-country management team and are prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our team members. This team has been resilient in the face of numerous challenges and will continue to deliver growth with balance between retail and foodservice.\nFrom an overall bottom line perspective, we anticipate earnings growth to be driven by our foodservice and International segments and improvements across the supply chain.\nWe expect to operate in a volatile, complex and high-cost environment again in fiscal 2023, which is why we are increasingly focused on reducing costs and inefficiencies as part of our One Supply Chain initiative. We have a strong track record of consistently capturing approximately $75 million per year of supply chain savings through our continuous improvement programs.\nThough these efforts continued over the last 3 years, the benefits have been masked by pandemic-related impacts, labor shortages, industry-wide supply chain disruption and most recently, broad-based inflation.\nWe will continue to identify and capture cost savings opportunities, find the efficiencies and drive unnecessary costs out of our system. We fully expect that over time, these actions, in addition to the benefits of broader market stabilization, will result in more normalized operating margins for our business.\nTaking all of these factors into account, we expect full-year net sales of $12.6 billion to $12.9 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.83 to $1.93 per share.\nWe have continued to benefit from our balanced business model, which is not heavily dependent on any one channel, protein, input or product category. We also have a dedicated, well-respected, experienced and stable management team that has again proven their ability to navigate and grow our business in volatile market conditions.\nOur long-term strategy to meet consumers where they want to eat with a broad portfolio of trusted brands and products will continue to be a key differentiator for our business. helping to drive growth for our customers and operators.\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss more detailed financial information and provide more color on key drivers to the fiscal 2023 outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I want to start my remarks by congratulating Jim Snee. Jim was recently recognized as the 2022 Responsible CEO Of The Year for transformative leadership by 3BL Media.\nDuring the award ceremony, Dave Armon, CEO of 3BL Media said, and I quote, \"The world needs business leaders who are operating with their eyes wide open and using the power of their businesses to bring forward meaningful ESG programs and policies to operate in a transparent manner.\"\nJim truly embodies these characteristics. We at Hormel Foods are honored to witness firsthand Jim's leadership style and be part of the difference our company is making to inspire a change, lift communities and bring people together. Congratulations, Jim, on this well-deserved recognition.\nThe company achieved a record full-year net sales of $12.5 billion, up 9% from a year ago. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $3.3 billion, a 5% decline from the prior year, which included an additional week. Organic net sales increased 2% for the fourth quarter. Operating income for the fourth quarter and the full year increased 3% and 17%, respectively, overcoming the additional week of sales last year.\nStrong results from Jennie-O Turkey Store segment, higher foodservice sales, pricing actions to mitigate inflationary pressures and the inclusion of the Planters business were the primary drivers to earnings growth during the year.\nFourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.51 was comparable to the record quarterly earnings set last year. Diluted earnings per share for the full year were $1.82, a 10% increase.\nThe company's actions to offset inflationary pressures were evident in the fourth quarter. Operating margin of 11.2% was significantly ahead of 9.6% in the third quarter. Operating margin for the year was 10.5%, an improvement versus operating margin of 9.9% last year.\nFor the full year, SG&A as a percentage of sales fell to 7.1% and from 7.5% last year. Advertising spend increased 14% compared to last year, with higher investments seen across every segment.\nIn fiscal 2023, we are again planning higher investments to support key brands, including Planters, SPAM, SKIPPY, Columbus, Black Label, Hormel Pepperoni and Jennie-O. Net unallocated expenses in 2022 decreased due to Planters acquisition costs last year.\nIn fiscal 2022, higher interest expense and investment losses on the rabbi trust net of associated deferred compensation negatively impacted earnings by approximately $0.05.\nThe effective tax rate for the year was 21.7% compared to 19.3% last year. The effective tax range for fiscal 2023 is expected to be 21% to 23%. The company again generated strong and consistent cash flow, with operating cash flow increasing 13% compared to last year.\nWe generated more than $1 billion in cash from operations, allowing us to invest in future growth, return a record amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, supporting ongoing business needs and increase our cash balance to nearly $1 billion.\nWe invested $279 million in capital projects in 2022. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2023 is $350 million, which includes investment in value-added capacity, technology and automation to increase production and drive long-term savings and efficiencies.\nAs Jim mentioned earlier, we recently approved another significant expansion to our operations in China, which we expect to come in operation in fiscal 2024.\nWe returned a record amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2022. We paid over $550 million in dividends during the year, including our 377th consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15. We announced a 6% increase in the dividend for fiscal 2023, marking the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nOur strong financial position also allows us to continue sharing our successes with our team members. For fiscal 2022, we will share approximately $20 million with the team, including our annual profit sharing for the 84th consecutive year.\nRemaining investment grade is a top priority for the company. The company ended the year with $3.3 billion of debt. On a net basis, we're below our stated goal of 1.5 to 2x EBITDA. Our first debt repayment related to the Planters acquisition is due June 2024 with a fixed rate of 65 basis points. Our total outstanding debt is fixed with an average yield of 1.7%.\nAs Jim previously mentioned, we expect sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2023. I want to revisit some of the comments we made in our third quarter earnings call in the context of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2023.\nHeading into the fourth quarter, we cited the impact of an escalation in certain operational logistical and inflationary costs. Generally, these assumptions played out as expected, and we anticipate similar trends in fiscal 2023.\nWe made additional progress across the supply chain during the fourth quarter and are becoming more efficient and productive. Fill rates improved compared to last year and the third quarter.\nWe continue to see increased applicant and hiring flow at our production facilities. Our focus is on onboarding and training new team members and creating a best-in-class experience throughout our operations.\nFreight and warehousing expenses remain elevated during the quarter. We saw signs of moderation in the domestic freight environment as truck availability improved, though higher diesel prices offset a portion of this benefit.\nHigher warehousing expenses were driven by a recovery in our inventory levels and industry-wide labor challenges. In 2023, we expect some of this pressure to be offset by savings from the work the team has been doing to control freight expenses and expand our logistics network.\nPrices on key protein inputs generally declined during the quarter, except for pork trim. Higher-priced inventory was a headwind in the quarter as we worked through inventory produced during the summer commodity peaks. Protein prices are expected to remain volatile in fiscal 2023.\nAdditionally, we expect packaging, energy and labor costs to remain elevated or increase in 2023 and for upstream challenges to persist.\nActions by our One Supply Chain team will be key to managing and mitigating additional cost escalation in these areas. Beginning in fiscal 2023, our Turkey business will primarily reside in the retail and foodservice segment.\nHPAI has reemerged this fall, and this unprecedented event has affected our vertically integrated supply chain at about 1/3 of the magnitude of the spring event. We now anticipate the impacts for HPAI to reduce production volume in our Turkey facilities through at least the first half of fiscal 2023.\nBreast meat prices remain historically high and have yet to moderate. Our team has done an exceptional job managing through disruptions caused by HPAI, reflected in our guidance range or assumptions for higher pension expense and higher feed costs for our Turkey business.\nTaken together, these costs are approximately $0.15 of headwind, specific to fiscal 2023. In addition to these costs, we have planned incremental investment against One Supply Chain and Go Forward, supporting areas such as infrastructure, automation, data analytics, brand support and investment in innovation capabilities.\nIn closing, I am extremely excited about Go Forward and our plans to unlock even more potential from our now $12 billion uncommon company. We have a long track record of successfully evolving our company, which is a credit to our strong management team and our inspired team members around the world. Better aligning our structure with our strategy, which is at the core of this transition, positions us well into 2023 and for the long term.\nSaid simply, Go Forward ensures that we will continue to deliver on our commitment to our team members, customers and shareholders. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

Snee\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone.\nWith the results we announced this morning, we have successfully achieved 7 straight quarters of record sales and 4 consecutive quarters of earnings growth. In the current environment, this is an especially notable achievement. Over the last 12 months, we have delivered 4 consecutive quarters of record sales in excess of $3 billion. We've grown diluted earnings per share of 15% compared to the trailing 12-month period. We've made considerable progress across our supply chain, including investments in capacity to support high-growth categories and improvement in the staffing levels, production volumes, inventories and fill rates.\nWe've integrated our largest acquisition to date with the Planters snack nuts business, we began transformational work on the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment while simultaneously managing through the impacts of HPAI. We further derisked commodity profitability with a new pork supply agreement, we have generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow, and we've increased the dividend for the 56th consecutive year.\nOur experienced management team has again proven their ability to navigate and grow the business in volatile market conditions. And these results demonstrate that our business is built for growth, our brands remain vibrant and relevant, our strategies remain effective, and our inspired team members around the world truly embody our results matter mentality.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered another quarter of record sales and double-digit operating income growth. Our team's execution again played a pivotal role in growth this quarter. As together, we overcame significant challenges, including continued broad-based inflationary pressures, persistent upstream and downstream supply chain disruptions, limited turkey supply and impacts in China from COVID-related restrictions and temporary plant shutdowns.\nDouble-digit operating income growth this quarter was led by outstanding contributions from Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Foods. The Jennie-O Turkey Store team significantly outperformed our profit expectations for the quarter as the team effectively managed limited turkey supply and maximize operational performance, all while working to restore the impacted turkey farms across the supply chain.\nRefrigerated Foods delivered double-digit value-added earnings growth on retail and foodservice items, more than offsetting lower commodity profitability. Similar to prior quarters, our balanced business model was able to offset inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, which were both significant headwinds during the quarter. Most importantly, our performance indicates our brands remain healthy and are generating growth. Consumers and operators have continued to engage with our brands due to their value, convenience and versatility.\nThe team drove volume, sales and share gains at retail for brands such as SKIPPY, Hormel Gatherings, Hormel chili, Dinty Moore and Mary Kitchen. I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work and coordinated efforts of the SKIPPY team who supported our customers and the category this past quarter. We continue to drive growth across our premium retail brands for products such as Applegate natural and organic meats and Columbus charcuterie. We also experienced an acceleration across our center store portfolio, which is firmly aligned with the value shopper.\nThe Grocery Products segment delivered strong organic volume and sales growth during the quarter and is well positioned to grow as consumers seek flexibility, versatility and yield at lower price points. Demand for foodservice products remained elevated as well as operators again turn to our items to help mitigate labor pressures and diversify menu offerings. Value-added products such as our premium bacon and sausage, sliced meats and line of premium prepared proteins performed exceptionally well this quarter.\nWe saw great demand for brands, including Austin Blues, Natural Choice, Bacon 1, Cafe H and Old Smokehouse. Regardless of channel, our brands have responded well to the pricing actions we have taken over the past 18 months even as current macroeconomic conditions pressure some of our customers, consumers and operators. The demand environment has remained favorable, especially for food and convenient meal solutions. We have seen this in the positive syndicated data for many of our Grocery and Refrigerated Products and in the momentum behind our branded foodservice items. In some cases, demand is still outpacing our ability to fully supply.\nOur broad portfolio of products spanning value tiers, eating occasions and channels positions us well. We anticipate some additional impact from elasticities as new pricing actions are reflected in the marketplace and we have accounted for this in our outlook. To date, the impact of price elasticities has been muted by other factors such as distribution and assortment gains, and as we have increased production to drive improved fill rates.\nOur teams remain keenly focused on the long-term needs of the business, our strategic priorities, and protecting the equity of our brands. Hormel Foods has a history of continuously evolving to become a better, more agile and more balanced global branded food company. In early August, we announced the next step in our strategic evolution, our Go Forward initiative.\nEffective October 31 of this year, the beginning of fiscal 2023, we will be organizing the business into 3 empowered segments: retail, foodservice and international. As a result of this initiative, we expect to elevate our clear strategic growth priorities; better align the business to the needs of our customers, consumers and operators; deepen our sales capabilities; simplify our approach to customers and operators; and enable faster decision-making. The 3 new segments will continue to be supported by the company's One Supply Chain team and corporate functions.\nWe are a much different company today than we were even a decade ago. Since the acquisition of SKIPPY in 2013, we have shifted to becoming a global branded food company with a food-forward mentality and a growing set of leading brands across channels. This shift has involved a series of intentional and strategic actions, including numerous strategic acquisitions focused on snacking and entertaining, growing our branded leadership positions in retail and foodservice and expanding our geographic footprint.\nIt includes regular evaluations of the portfolio, which in some cases led to divestitures of businesses where we identified a better long-term owner; includes a rightsizing of our pork supply chain, including the divestiture of 2 hog harvest facilities and the entry into long-term pork supply agreements. It includes the creation of One Supply Chain, which centralized operations, logistics and sourcing decisions to drive the efficiencies for the total company.\nThe modernization of our technology and e-commerce capabilities, including Project Orion and the creation of the digital experience group and most recently, the transformational efforts at Jennie-O Turkey Store. This next step, a new operating model is a culmination of these recent strategic actions.\nAs part of the Go Forward initiative, we will be folding in the important work we've been doing to transform the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. As we said, when we announced the transformational efforts, turkey will continue to play an important role in our company and will contribute to growth in both retail and foodservice. We remain on track to integrate all business functions, combine the Jennie-O Turkey Store supply chain into the broader Hormel Foods One Supply Chain and drive SG&A cost synergies of approximately $20 million to $30 million annually by fiscal 2023.\nOur successful transition to the new strategic operating model is dependent on strong leadership and execution from our teams. As previously disclosed, Deanna Brady, Mark Ourada and Swen Neufeldt will be leading the retail, foodservice, and international segments, respectively. Each of these leaders has over 25 years of experience with the company and reputations for delivering results.\nUnder their leadership, we expect to drive sustainable growth in line with our long-term growth goals of 2% to 3% top line growth and 5% to 7% bottom line growth. There has been a tremendous amount of what we've done on this initiative and more work to do in the coming months as we create the Hormel Foods of the future.\nWe will provide more information on Go Forward next week at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference. We will also be releasing recast financial information during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to aid in comparability to historical financial data.\nEarlier this week, we released our 2021 Global Impact Report, which details how we are advancing corporate responsibility, ESG, and our food journey at Hormel Foods. This is the 16th year we have published a report of this kind. Thanks to the incredible work and dedication of our team members, partners and suppliers, Hormel Foods is making a difference. We remain committed to our mission to be one of the top corporate citizens in the world and encourage you to review the report and the progress we have made to advance efforts through our 20 By 30 Challenge.\nOur business remains healthy even as we continue to navigate some of the most difficult operating conditions in the company's 130-year history. Our revised full year guidance reflects both the continued top line strength we expect to see across our business and escalated cost pressures, which are impacting the back half of the year. For the full year, we are increasing our net sales expectations to $12.2 billion to $12.8 billion, and we are lowering our diluted earnings per share guidance range to $1.78 to $1.85 per share.\nThere are 2 key takeaways from our guidance revision. One, we expect top line strength across our businesses to continue as our portfolio is well positioned for the current macroeconomic climate. And two, an escalation in certain operational, logistical and inflationary costs, which began impacting results in the third quarter has lowered our earnings expectations for the back half of the year. However, we believe the majority of these cost pressures to be transient in nature and to subside over time.\nFirst, from a top line perspective, momentum remains very strong. We are confident in our ability to exceed our previous sales guidance due to strong demand for our foodservice and center store grocery brands, higher turkey markets, and the pricing actions we have taken across the portfolio. Our long-term strategy to meet consumers where they want to eat with a broad portfolio of products has been a key differentiator in the current environment.\nSecond, we expect to absorb incremental costs in the fourth quarter related to certain operational, logistical and inflationary headwinds similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. In terms of magnitude, we view each of these cost buckets similarly.\nStarting with operational costs. We have made progress across our supply chain over the past year as a recovery in staffing levels has contributed to higher production volumes inventories and fill rates. As we said last quarter, inefficiencies related to new team members and turnover have impacted operations leading to higher costs. We continue to see this pressure in the third quarter and do not expect meaningful improvement for the balance of the year.\nWe are also experiencing higher-than-expected freight and warehousing costs both domestically and for our international business. Freight rates have moderated recently, but this benefit has been more than offset by elevated fuel surcharges and significantly higher warehousing costs. Protein prices on key inputs have remained elevated compared to our expectations and historical averages. While we have mechanisms in place to manage the impact of elevated and volatile protein costs, markets have generally sustained higher price levels for longer than we anticipated in our previous outlook. We believe these cost pressures are transient and likely to subside over the coming quarters.\nWe fully expect our One Supply Chain team to continue to improve over time as our teams effectively onboard, train and retain our new team members while striving to provide a best-in-class workplace experience. This is in addition to the investments we are making in automation and supply chain optimization. We also expect to benefit from the work the team has been doing to control freight expenses and capture the benefits from our recently expanded logistics network.\nFinally, we are starting to see a relief across key input cost markets that are better aligned to our expectations, which should present the opportunity for margin expansion in the coming quarters. The revision to guidance for the year is disappointing, but we will continue to manage the business for the long term as we navigate these difficult business conditions, leveraging our balanced business model and experienced management team.\nAs I look beyond the fourth quarter, I have a high level of optimism regarding our future. We expect our brands to continue to perform well and plan to introduce an exciting slate of innovation in 2023. We anticipate improvements in our supply chain and the industry-wide supply chain as the broader markets stabilize. We expect turkey supply to normalize, allowing our teams to continue their work to create a demand-oriented and optimized turkey portfolio.\nWe fully expect our international business to be a significant growth driver for the company and to benefit from the investments we have made during the year, including the new Asia Pacific Innovation Center. And once implemented, our new strategic operating model will better align the businesses to the needs of our customers, consumers and operators to drive sustainable long-term growth. For all of these reasons and from the inspired work of our 20,000 team members around the world, I could not be more excited for the future of our company.\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss financial information relating to the quarter and provide more color on key drivers to the outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone.\nRecord third quarter sales were $3 billion. Net sales and organic net sales increased 6% and 3%, respectively, compared to last year. Volume for the quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, down 9% compared to last year. Organic volume declined 11%. These declines were in line with our expectations and are attributable to our effort to rationalize lower-margin commodity port volume and lower Turkey sales as a result of HPAI. These volume declines generally had strong underlying growth from many of the value-added businesses.\nGross profit increased to $83 million compared to last year, a 20% increase. Gross profit margin was 16.7% compared to 14.8% last year. Improvement was driven primarily by strength in Jennie-O Turkey Store and the Refrigerated Foods in addition to strategic pricing actions to help offset inflationary pressures.\nSG&A expenses declined 2% in the third quarter as we lapped the Planters' acquisition-related expenses last year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for the third quarter decreased to 7.3% from 7.9% last year. We continued to generate strong sales and demonstrate disciplined cost management.\nWe again increased the support for our leading brands. For the quarter, advertising expense increased 21% or approximately $0.01 per share. Advertising expenses have increased 29% year-to-date.\nOperating income increased 40% to $291 million. On a comparable basis, which removes the impact of Planters onetime costs last year, adjusted operating income increased 17%. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.6% compared to 7.2% last year. Adjusted operating margin was 8.7% last year.\nThe effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter, up from 13.3% for the same period last year. Last year's rate reflected the benefit from a large volume of stock option exercises and a onetime foreign tax benefit. Our effective tax rate guidance range of 20.5% to 22.5% remains unchanged. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share of $0.40 represented a 25% increase compared to last year. On a comparable basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%.\nThe company continued to generate consistent and strong cash flows. Operating cash flow for the third quarter increased 143% to $186 million and operating cash flow through the first 3 quarters increased 74% to $763 million. We paid our 376th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15 at an annual rate of $1.04 per share. This completes the 94th consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend payments to our shareholders.\nCapital expenditures in the third quarter were $61 million compared to $54 million last year. The fiscal 2022 target for capital expenditures is unchanged at $310 million. We are benefiting from new production capacity we have added to our system over the past year and remain on track to open new capacity for SPAM in the first half of fiscal 2023.\nRemaining investment grade is a top priority for the company. Since acquiring Planters business last year, we have grown our cash position and EBITDA. On a net basis, we're now well within the stated goal of 1.5 to 2x EBITDA by 2023.\nTurning to our segment results for the quarter. Refrigerated Foods volume declined 18% and organic volume decreased 19% compared to last year. As referenced earlier, this anticipated decline in volume was primarily due to lower commodity sales resulting from the company's new pork supply agreement. Sales increased 2% and organic sales increased 1%. Retail products, such as Applegate, natural and organic needs, Hormel's Gatherings party trays, Hormel Natural Choice sliced meats, Hormel Square Table entrees and Lloyd's barbeque products grew volume and sales for the quarter while the Foodservice businesses delivered another excellent quarter.\nRefrigerated Foods segment profit increased 16% driven by strong results from the value-added businesses, more than offsetting higher operational and logistics costs and lower commodity profitability. Grocery Products volume increased 15% and sales increased 25%, led by strong demand across the nut butters. Mexican and simple meals portfolio and the addition of the Planters business. Organic volume increased 8% and organic sales increased 13%. Organic sales gains were led by products such as SKIPPY Spreads, WHOLLY Guacamole, Hormel chili, Dinty Moore beef stew and Mary Kitchen hash.\nSegment profit declined 5% due to the impact from continued inflationary pressures and lower results from MegaMex. Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered another outstanding quarter despite challenges related to HPAI. Volume and sales declines were less than expected and segment profit increased by more than $30 million due to higher commodity prices and foodservice sales.\nFor the International & Other segment, volume was down 11% and organic volume declined 12%. Net sales declined 5% and organic sales fell 6%. Higher global sales of SPAM luncheon meat and improved results in Brazil did not overcome an overall decline in export sales and lower sales in China. Export volumes declined because of current export logistics challenge and lower commodity sales due to the company's new pork supply agreement. Sales in China was negatively impacted by COVID-related restrictions and temporary planned shutdowns.\nSegment profit declined 9% as growth in China did not offset the impact of lower export sales. We have revised our full year fiscal 2022 sales and earnings guidance ranges. Consolidated net sales are expected to exceed our previous expectations benefiting from continued top line strength and pricing actions implemented across the gross products portfolio at the start of the quarter.\nWe project elasticities to remain below historical levels. From a segment perspective, we anticipate profit growth from the Jennie-O Turkey Store and International & Other and anticipate declines for Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products. As a reminder, all segments benefited from an additional week of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nJennie-O Turkey Store remains on pace to exceed profit expectations for the year with significant profit growth in the fourth quarter. Sales volumes are projected to decline approximately 30% in the fourth quarter due to continued supply gaps in its vertically integrated supply chain and whole-bird sales pulled forward into the third quarter. Further, with the positive cases identified earlier this week in our supply chain, we expect the impact from HPAI to reduce production volume in our turkey facilities through at least the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nThe International & Other segment anticipates growth in the fourth quarter driven by branded exports and improved profitability in China. Persistent shipping interruptions pose a risk to export sales and profit growth while additional COVID-related restrictions in China could pressure in-country results.\nRefrigerated Foods expects continued strength in the foodservice business and strong demand for its retail products. Profits will be pressured by higher raw material and operational and logistics costs. Lastly most of products expect improved results sequentially due to strong demand across the business and from pricing actions effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nAs Jim detailed, we continue to battle extreme input cost volatility and inflation during the third quarter and expect this to continue for the balance of the year. Our previous outlook assumed key protein markets to move seasonally lower into the fourth quarter. Given that prices on key inputs remained elevated for the majority of August, we are managing through higher-than-expected inventory costs to begin the quarter.\nWe have seen some relief in these key markets over the past week which, if sustained, would benefit margins in the back half of the fourth quarter. Lower industry-wide turkey supplies are expected to keep prices higher near term. Breast meat prices set a record in the third quarter and have yet to moderate. Our team has done an exceptional job managing through disruptions caused by HPAI.\nWe continue to see increased hiring and applicant flow at our production facilities. Inefficiencies and elevated production costs related to newer team members, turnover, absenteeism and overtime, have affected operations but should ease over time. Investments in value-added capacity are paying off strategically, including our pepperoni expansion in Omaha, new bacon lines at the Austin facility and the addition of co-manufacturing partners to support multiple product lines.\nWe expect freight and warehousing costs for the domestic and international businesses to remain elevated, and our One Supply Chain team is actively looking for ways to drive efficiencies and control costs.\nIn closing, I am excited for the next step in our evolution as a global branded food company, the Go Forward initiative. This will create greater focus on our 6 strategic priorities, better align our business to the needs of our customers, consumers and operators and position us well to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

Snee\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Our team continues to successfully navigate some of the most difficult operating conditions in the company's 130-year history as we again delivered strong top and bottom line growth this quarter. I want to express my gratitude to the entire team for their commitment and ability to drive results.\nThere are many examples across our company of our results-matter focus. And I would like to specifically acknowledge 2 teams who showed incredible dedication and determination during the last quarter.\nFirst, I want to recognize our Jennie-O Turkey Store team. In March, highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, was confirmed in our supply chain. And our team quickly and effectively mobilized into crisis mode. This involved working long hours over the course of many weeks to protect the safety of the turkey flocks, provide transparent communication to customers and operators and plan for future business interruptions, all while operating the day-to-day business. This was compounded by severe weather in early May, which also impacted several facilities within the supply chain.\nOur Jennie-O team went through a lot this quarter, showing unwavering commitment and resolve in the face of some exceedingly demanding situations. I thank them for the work they've accomplished and for the work yet to come.\nSecond, I would like to applaud our team in China for their incredible execution during truly unprecedented times. Strict lockdowns forced the partial closure of 2 of our manufacturing facilities. Some of our team members volunteered to sleep and live inside the facilities for 10 days to ensure the plants remained operational until normal production could resume.\nSimultaneously, our sales and marketing teams drove outstanding retail sales gains in anticipation of widespread lockdowns. The ingenuity, resourcefulness and grit displayed by our entire team in China was truly commendable and another example of what makes our company uncommon.\nIn the second quarter, our team delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of record sales and third consecutive quarter of earnings growth. Operating margin also improved compared to the first quarter, an indication that our balanced business model and efforts to mitigate inflationary pressures are working.\nCustomer and operator demand for our leading brands remained robust as we continue to realize the benefits of investments in our direct sales force, diversified product portfolios, increased advertising, brand building and innovation. Across all channels, our brands have responded well to pricing actions. And we are actively managing pricing and promotional levers to ensure the long-term health of our brands and the categories in which they compete.\nWe also made meaningful progress across our supply chain during the quarter where our investments in capacity and recovery in staffing levels contributed to improved fill rates, inventories and production volumes.\nOne of our most important strategies has been to create a balanced, flexible and diversified business model able to withstand market volatility, business fluctuations and other unforeseen events. As our second quarter and first half results clearly demonstrate, our strategy to bring balance into our business continues to differentiate Hormel Foods from others in the industry.\nOne of the ways we do this is through our channel diversification. In the initial stages of the pandemic, we leaned heavily on our retail businesses, both domestically and internationally, to drive growth. In the current environment, we are growing with the foodservice industry through its recovery and continuing to meet elevated demand at retail.\nFrom a top line perspective, we drove 15% growth from our retail businesses in the second quarter and continued to see elevated demand for our leading brands, including WHOLLY, SKIPPY, Hormel Square Table refrigerated entrees, SPAM, Hormel Gatherings, Jennie-O, Columbus and Applegate.\nWe are also seeing our investments in the e-commerce channel pay dividends with solid above-category sales growth and share gains. As measured by IRI, sales increased 5% for the quarter, ending with a strong April. E-commerce constitutes around 12% of our tracked retail sales and is an important part of our future growth.\nWe demonstrated our leadership position in the foodservice channel again during the second quarter, driving sales growth of 32% compared to last year. Growth was extremely balanced with strength in both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store.\nWe have made substantial gains in the fast-growing convenience store channel, in large part due to the scale the Planters brand brings to our company. Growth from the Planters and Corn Nuts businesses in this channel is enabling expanded placements of other products.\nRecent wins in the retail and snacking space include SPAM, chili, SKIPPY Peanut Butter, Compleats, Black Label bacon and egg bite, Columbus snack trays, Justin's items and Hormel Gatherings party trays. Additionally, we've placed premium foodservice items such as Austin Blues barbecue, Fire Braised meats and Bacon 1 pre-cooked bacon to be used in prepared items in this channel. Like e-commerce and the retail channel, convenience stores provide an important part of our future growth in foodservice.\nInternationally, we are continuing to make progress to bring even more balance to the company. Our business in China is a great example of this. This quarter, we again experienced demand softness in foodservice due to the country's COVID-related restrictions. Our team quickly pivoted its resources from foodservice to the retail channel. Sales of SPAM and SKIPPY surged. And our team was also able to effectively redirect foodservice items to food security programs to help supply those experiencing lockdowns.\nOur strategy to meet consumers where they want to eat with a broad portfolio of products from mainstream to premium, both domestically and internationally, is a strategy that has served us well and will continue to serve us well into the future.\nFrom an earnings perspective, our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had an outstanding quarter as its ability to adjust to current market conditions and meet strong foodservice demand drove higher results. Likewise, our foodservice businesses in Refrigerated Foods were able to price for inflation and deliver excellent volume growth. These businesses more than offset higher freight expenses for all segments and the earnings decline in Grocery Products, which absorbed significantly higher costs for certain inputs such as avocados, protein and packaging.\nWe have announced another round of pricing actions across our grocery portfolio to help mitigate these inflationary pressures, but we'll, in the meantime, lean into our balanced model as we did this past quarter. The balanced business model has been a key driver behind our recent success and our long-term growth. We remain confident in our ability to withstand volatile economic conditions and market cycles through our continued focus on balance.\nWe successfully completed the integration of all aspects of the Planters snack nuts business during the second quarter, and the business continues to perform at the high end of our expectations. During the cutover period in February, we experienced lower fill rates as we fully transitioned inventory into our logistics network and assumed control of the entire supply chain. While this did have a short-term impact on sales and consumption, we have seen improvements in customer service levels and expect consumption data to show continued improvement in the coming months.\nAs we celebrate 1 year of owning the Planters business, I am proud of the excellent progress we have made on our commitments from last June. We have invested heavily behind the Planters and Corn Nuts brands. We are on track to capture the synergies identified during diligence, and we have leveraged this business to amplify our scale in snacking and entertaining.\nAfter an excellent first quarter and significant profit growth in the second quarter, our Jennie-O Turkey Store team is facing an uncertain period ahead due to the impacts and risks to its supply chain from HPAI. Similar to what we experienced in 2015, HPAI is expected to have a meaningful impact on industry poultry supplies over the coming months, including large supply gaps in the Jennie-O Turkey Store vertically integrated supply chain beginning in the third quarter.\nOn a positive note, it appears that the bio-security measures the company has implemented since 2015 have provided additional protection against the virus, as the number of company-managed turkeys impacted to date is 25% lower than during the previous event. Breast meat prices have already risen to levels higher than any point in 2015, currently trading above $6 compared to the previous all-time high of $5.85. We have seen increases in other turkey markets as well.\nFrom a cost perspective, feed prices are significantly higher with corn and soybean meal up more than 125% and 40%, respectively, as of early May. Additionally, there is further upside risk to feed prices with later plantings due to cold and wet weather across the Midwest this spring. The cost of production labor at company manufacturing facilities has also increased more than 50% on average compared to 2015. Our team is taking the appropriate actions to protect the health of the turkeys across our supply chain, managing through operational challenges caused by the outbreaks and adapting to changing business conditions.\nWhile simultaneously managing through the impacts of HPAI, our team made progress on the Jennie-O Turkey Store business transformation. During the second quarter, we closed the Benson Avenue facility and successfully transferred approximately 200 employees to the newer and larger manufacturing facility in Willmar.\nWe remain on track to integrate business functions, consolidate the Jennie-O Turkey Store supply chain into the broader Hormel Foods One Supply Chain and drive SG&A cost synergies of approximately $20 million to $30 million annually by fiscal 2023. Above all, the team is focused on creating a business model that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers, consumers and operators to drive long-term sustainable growth.\nI also want to provide an update on the great work our team is doing to fulfill our ESG commitments and achieve our 20 by 30 goals. During the second quarter, we announced we are on track to match 100% of domestic energy use with renewable sourcing by the end of 2022. We announced that our Justin's brand is transitioning to jars that use 30% less plastic. We were ranked #57 on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Fortune 500 list of the largest green power users.\nWe were named one of America's most trustworthy companies by Newsweek. And in May, for the 13th time, we were named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL Media. This ranking recognizes outstanding environmental, social and governance transparency and performance. We are proud and honored to continue to be named a top corporate citizen.\nLastly, I want to share a recent success story from our Inspired Pathways free community college program. This week, we hired the first individuals from the program to participate in paid summer internships. This marks yet another example of why we believe this program can be generational for our employees, their dependents and for the future of the company.\nWe are reaffirming our sales guidance range of net sales between $11.7 billion and $12.5 billion and narrowing the earnings range of $1.87 to $1.97 per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver our sales guidance given robust demand for our brands across the retail, foodservice and international channels, improvements in our supply chain, investments in capacity and from strategic pricing actions.\nFrom an earnings perspective, we expect a strong finish to the year from our Refrigerated Foods business. We anticipate a fourth quarter improvement from pricing actions taken across our Grocery Products portfolio. We are navigating the impact of HPAI on the Jennie-O Turkey Store supply chain and external factors affecting the International & Other segment, including current export logistics challenges and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Our teams have actions in place to manage through these challenges and drive results for the company.\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss financial information relating to the quarter and provide more color on key drivers to our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone.\nWe delivered another quarter of record sales of $3.1 billion, a 19% increase compared to last year. Organic sales increased 10%. Gross profit increased $77 million compared to last year, a 16% increase. This improvement was driven by strength in Jennie-O Turkey Store, growth from Refrigerated Foods, the addition of the Planters snack nuts business and strategic pricing actions to offset inflationary pressures.\nGross profit margin was 17.9% compared to 18.3% last year and 17.7% in the first quarter. SG&A expenses increased 12% compared to last year due to the addition of the Planters snack nuts business and the higher advertising investments in our brands. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased to 7.3% from 7.7% last year. This speaks to our continued strong sales growth and disciplined cost management.\nWe increased advertising investments in the second quarter to support the Planters, Columbus and SPAM brands. For the quarter, advertising expense increased by 27% or approximately $0.01 per share.\nOperating income increased 16% to $335 million. Operating margins were 10.8% compared to 11.1% last year. Operating margin increased sequentially from 10.5% in the first quarter. As anticipated, we delivered quarter-over-quarter improvement in operating margin and made continued progress in mitigating the significant inflation we experienced.\nInterest and investment income declined $9 million, primarily due to lower results from our rabbi trust, which generally tracks with equity market. Interest expense increased $7 million compared to last year.\nOur effective tax rate was 18.7% for the quarter, down from 22.1% for the same period last year. The lower rate this quarter was primarily due to tax benefits from increased stock option exercises. Our effective tax range guidance of 20.5% to 22.5% is unchanged from the prior outlook. The net result of all these factors was diluted earnings per share of $0.48, a 14% increase over $0.42 last year.\nTurning to cash flows. Operating cash flow for the second quarter increased 24% to $193 million. Operating cash flow for the first half of 2022 increased 60% to $577 million. Strong earnings growth has been a key catalyst to these increases.\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter were $78 million compared to $45 million last year. During the quarter, we benefited from new capacity, including our pepperoni expansion at Papillion Foods plant in Nebraska and raw bacon investment in our plant in Austin.\nOur fiscal 2022 target for capital expenditures is unchanged at $310 million. We paid our 375th consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15 at an annual rate of $1.04 per share. We did not repurchase any shares during the first half. We will repurchase shares opportunistically based on our internal valuation.\nWe expect to make our first payment and begin our deleveraging related to Planters acquisition in the back half of the year. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating and deleveraging to 1.5 to 2x EBITDA by 2023.\nTurning to our segment results. Segment profit increased by 15% as growth in Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Foods more than offset declines in Grocery Products and International & Other. The company benefited from Planters sales of $239 million in the quarter and the related profit contribution.\nRefrigerated Foods volume declined 13%, and organic volume decreased 14%. The decline in volume was primarily due to our strategic decision to restructure a pork supply agreement, reducing our exposure to low-margin commodity pork business and better aligning resources to value-added growth. Sales increased 13%, and organic sales increased 11%.\nRefrigerated Foods segment profit increased 3%. Refrigerated Foods saw meaningful improvement in many areas across the supply chain due to improved labor availability and additional production capacity helping to offset production constraint.\nGrocery Products volume increased 19%, and sales increased 39% due to the addition of the Planters business. Organic volume increased 2%, and organic sales increased 7%. Segment profit declined 9% as organic sales growth and the addition of Planters snack nuts business was unable to offset considerable inflationary pressures and lower results from MegaMex.\nJennie-O Turkey Store had another excellent quarter with sales up 16% and segment profit up nearly 400%. Higher commodity prices and improved foodservice sales drove the substantial improvement in segment profit. HPAI had an immaterial impact on the segment's results for the second quarter.\nFor the International & Other segment, volume was down 14% and organic volume declined 15% due, in large part, to lower commodity sales associated with the company's new pork supply agreement. Segment profit declined 3% as profit growth in China did not overcome lower results from the export business.\nWe continue to battle extreme input cost volatility and inflation. We have seen increases across all our inputs, including raw materials, packaging and supplies, freight and logistics and labor. We expect a stabilization as demand and supply come more into balance and anticipate certain costs, such as labor, to be more structural in nature.\nProtein markets have generally remained elevated and above the year-ago and historical levels. For context, pork prices, as measured by the USDA composite cutout, were 6% higher in the second quarter compared to last year and more than 30% higher than the 5-year average. We have seen similar dynamics across beef and chicken markets and witnessed an acceleration in the turkey market during the quarter due to the emergence of HPAI.\nFeed also continues to be highly inflationary. Our hedging program at Jennie-O Turkey Store has effectively helped us manage risk near term. Looking to the back half of the year, we expect protein and feed costs to remain volatile and elevated compared to historical levels.\nCosts for packaging and supplies are up double-digits on average over last year and accelerated during the most recent quarter. Trucking freight is also up significantly on both an absolute and per volume basis. This is being driven by volatility in the spot market and soaring diesel fuel prices. While we're noticing some relief in spot markets in the third quarter, increased fuel surcharges are partially offsetting this benefit. Ocean freight rates and export logistics continue to challenge our international team.\nLabor shortages have been underpinning the inflation we have seen across many of our inputs and in our own facilities. We continue to see positive trends in staffing levels, which has allowed us to increase production in important product lines such as SPAM, raw bacon and pizza toppings. Inefficiencies related to new team members and the turnover continued to impact operations, but we expect improvement in the back half of the year. As labor recovers across the industry-wide supply chain, we expect fewer upstream and downstream challenges.\nOur experienced management team has done an excellent job managing profitability in the face of these challenges through strategic shifts in product mix, disciplined management of SG&A and driving efficiencies through our One Supply Chain. As Jim mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2022 sales guidance and narrowing our earnings guidance range.\nFor Refrigerated Foods, we expect a strong finish to the year led by continued strength in the foodservice businesses and strong demand for retail products. Our Grocery Products business will continue to be challenged by inflationary pressures until the recently announced pricing actions for this segment becomes effective in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the uncertainty regarding HPAI and based on our current expectations, Jennie-O Turkey Store sales volumes are expected to decline approximately 30% in the back half of the year due to supply gaps in its vertically integrated supply chain. With the third quarter representing the seasonal earnings low for this business, we expect third quarter earnings to be in line with last year.\nThe International & Other segment continues to see strong demand both in its export business and in China. However, due to the impact of 2 partial plant shutdowns in China as a result of COVID-related restrictions and persistent export logistic challenges, there remains a risk to earnings growth in the back half of the year.\nAcross our retail businesses, we expect continued strong demand and anticipate improvements in fill rates, assortment and its strategic promotional activity to mitigate potential downside of elasticities. We continue to see strong momentum in the foodservice channel with demand from many items outpacing our ability to supply. This strong demand, coupled with supply chain improvement, give us confidence in our ability to deliver sales and earnings growth in the second half of the year.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.",

Good morning, everyone. I want to start off by thanking our dedicated team members around the world for once again achieving strong results in a complex and dynamic environment. The combination of our execution and balanced business model allowed us to deliver strong first quarter results, keeping us on track to achieve our sales and earnings guidance for the year. These results further demonstrate the importance of our strategy, the positive impact of our actions and our team's ability to perform in challenging operating conditions. Our entire team can be proud of our accomplishments this quarter.\nIn the first quarter, our team delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record sales and achieved high-quality earnings growth. Net sales surpassed $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, a 24% increase. Operating income also increased significantly, up 19%. Most importantly, demand for our products remained elevated across all our business segments and go-to-market channels. We increased advertising investments during the quarter to sustain our momentum.\nOur One Supply Chain team once again demonstrated their resiliency and allowed us to deliver organic growth in our domestic value-added businesses for the quarter. From late December through January, our team experienced some of the heaviest operational impacts that we have seen since the start of the pandemic. These impacts stemmed from significant labor shortages due to the Omicron variant, severe upstream and downstream disruptions and industry-wide operational challenges. I want to again thank our One Supply Chain team for their tireless work and their unwavering commitment to employee safety in these challenging times.\nFiscal 2022 is an important year as we return to top and bottom line growth. Our path forward, which we detailed at our Virtual Investor Day in October, represents the 6 strategic imperatives that will guide our actions over the next few years. These include expanding our leadership in foodservice, protecting and growing our core brands, aggressively developing our global presence, amplifying our scale in snacking and entertaining, enhancing growth of our ethnic and Food Forward portfolios and continuing to transform our company.\nTo provide added color on the quarter as well as our long-term views on the business, I'd like to give an update on the progress we have made since October.\nIn the first quarter, we again demonstrated our leadership position in the foodservice channel. Sales were 51% ahead of last year. We continue to benefit from our direct sales force and differentiated portfolio, which is perfectly positioned to meet the needs of today's foodservice operators with labor and time-saving products. We saw improvement in almost every category across our portfolio of foodservice businesses. Consumer demand for food away from home has been very strong. And according to recently published government and technomic data, conditions are improving across the food service industry to help meet this demand.\nFoodservice sales have risen at an average rate of approximately 25% over the trailing 12-month period, accelerating through the close of calendar year 2021. Operator sentiment also continues to improve from pandemic lows, and foodservice industry employment has made steady gains. These factors, coupled with the demand we are seeing for our products across all geographies in the U.S., support our positive views on the near-term and long-term health of the industry.\nAs we look forward, we plan to further expand our leadership position in areas like restaurants, hotels, colleges and universities and use the scale of the Planters brand to grow our company's presence in emerging growth spaces, such as convenience stores. We also expect to protect and grow our core brands in fiscal 2022 and into the future.\nOur retail businesses grew sales 17% during the first quarter. We have leading positions in over 40 categories, with brands such as Hormel Black Label, SPAM, SKIPPY, WHOLLY and Jennie-O. Elevated demand for many of these core brands over the last 2 years has surpassed our ability to fully supply.\nAnd in these highly inflationary times, having leading brands that connect to consumers in meaningful ways is vital to success. We understand the importance of brand stewardship. And in the first quarter, we increased advertising investments in each business segment to ensure our brands remain well supported, collectively increasing advertising investments by 38%. The strong brand equity we have built over a decade has allowed us to simultaneously increase our household penetration, grow the size and our share in many of the categories in which we compete and implement strategic pricing actions to help offset inflationary pressures.\nWe have made excellent strides connecting with consumers in the e-commerce channel as well. During the quarter, we exceeded overall category growth, with more than 12% of our IRI track retail sales now coming from this particularly important and fast-growing channel.\nTransitioning to our third priority, we need to aggressively develop and expand our global presence. Our international business is healthy and positioned for long-term growth despite issues affecting the first quarter.\nSimilar to the broader industry in China, we experienced some demand softness, predominantly in foodservice, due to the country's COVID-related restrictions. Additionally, limited railcar availability and U.S. port congestion negatively affected our export business.\nAs we look ahead, our export business is expected to benefit from demand for our global brands such as SPAM and SKIPPY. Our China business is expected to see growth from its scalable foodservice business as well as from retail, with momentum behind the SPAM brand and innovative snacking items such as beef, turkey and SKIPPY funkiness.\nAnd we have made considerable progress growing our global presence through our partnerships in the Philippines, South Korea, Europe and Indonesia. We have great partners in these geographies who share our growth mindset. To further support growth, we plan to continue to make many investments into our international business this year.\nDuring the first quarter, we increased brand investments in advertising. Later this year, we will open a new Asia Pacific research and development facility, which will support our operations in China and throughout Southeast Asia. And we have plans to further build out our infrastructure in the important Chinese market. We expect to bring meaningful scale to other select global markets as well. And we are making the necessary investments to succeed long term.\nOur fourth priority focuses on our next growth platform, snacking and entertaining. Snacking and entertainment cuts across all segments and channels, and we are ideally positioned to leverage our powerful and complementary portfolio of brands across salsa, guacamole, nut butters, nuts and premium deli meats.\nPlanters is a cornerstone to our snacking platform, and that business continues to perform at the high end of our expectations. We completed the supply chain integration of the Planters and Corn Nuts businesses in February. As a result, we expect continued synergies and improved customer service levels going forward.\nAs we discussed, when we announced the acquisition of the Planters business, we are on track to launch many new innovative items, including Planters Sweet & Spicy Dry Roasted peanuts and introduce a refresh to the branding and packaging. We're also investing in the brand, including our newest campaign, All or One. Seeing the great work of our teams has made me even more confident about where we can take this brand in the future and further strengthens our belief in the potential for Planters.\nOur fifth initiative is to enhance the growth of our ethnic and Food Forward portfolios. Our MegaMex and Applegate businesses have been growing, and we are evolving our portfolio at a rapid pace to meet the changing needs of today's consumers.\nOur MegaMex business grew volume and sales during the first quarter, led by strong demand for WHOLLY products at retail. Applegate delivered another outstanding quarter, with growth across the portfolio from products such as breaded chicken, breakfast sausage and sliced meats. Applegate has given us a clear competitive advantage in the natural and organic meat space and has provided a platform for some of our most important environmental work, such as regenerative agriculture.\nFinally, we need to continue to transform our company to enable future growth by modernizing our organization. Initiatives like Project Orion, One Supply Chain and our automation efforts are all focus areas, as is the work we are doing to transform the Jennie-O Turkey Store business.\nAs promised from our fourth quarter call, we want to give you an update on our Jennie-O Turkey Store transformation. Our priority has been to build a more demand-oriented and optimized turkey portfolio that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers, consumers and operators that will result in long-term growth, improved profitability and lower earnings volatility. To that end, we have taken numerous actions and will take many more actions to optimize our business model.\nDuring the first quarter, we started to see the benefits of our actions of shifting from commodity to branded value-added products. For an example, as an industry leader in turkey, we are investing behind the Jennie-O brand to drive greater growth in our most profitable, high-growth product lines in retail and foodservice. In conjunction with driving improvement in our value-added products, we are also taking aggressive actions to optimize our portfolio. Combined with increased pricing, our brand investments and SKU rationalization are leading to a healthier business.\nFrom a supply chain perspective, we remain on track to close the Benson Avenue facility in Willmar, Minnesota, in the second quarter. Our Benson Avenue team members are currently transitioning to our newer and larger facility in Willmar, which will supplement our staffing levels.\nTo date, the Jennie-O supply chain has largely been run separately from the rest of our supply chain, here to it being vertically integrated. By the start of fiscal 2023, we will leverage our One Supply Chain capabilities to integrate all facilities into the broader Hormel Foods network.\nAs we integrate these plants into the Hormel Foods network and rationalize commodity SKUs, we will free up plant space for additional production capacity of many product lines that will service any brand in the Hormel Foods portfolio. This is a monumental step and one that will make our entire company more efficient.\nSimilar to the integration of the supply chain, we will integrate key business functions more deeply into the Hormel Foods organization. In addition to integrating IT services, finance and accounting and HR we, integrated the R&D organization into Hormel Foods R&D during the first quarter.\nLooking to the remainder of the fiscal year, we will start the process to integrate other business functions, such as our selling organization and marketing teams, into the broader organization. This integration will leverage the strengths of the parent company and the knowledge of Turkey to create a better business model. Over time, we expect the Jennie-O Turkey Store business to achieve higher or stable growth and improved profitability. We also expect other financial gains, including increased asset efficiency, higher manufacturing throughputs, better labor utilization and CapEx avoidance. We expect these changes will drive selling, general and administrative cost synergies of approximately $20 million to $30 million annually by fiscal 2023.\nIn addition to the progress we have made on our 2022 Path Forward, we continue to invest in our people, our partners and our communities to deliver on our ESG commitments. During the first quarter, we distributed our annual profit sharing for the 83rd consecutive year. We continued our environmental stewardship work, with investments in additional wind energy projects, which strengthens our position in renewable energy. We supplied donations to many causes, responded to crises where we could help and supported many local communities. Additionally, our Inspired Pathways Community College program continued to receive accolades and was awarded an Anthem Award for the most impactful corporate initiative in education, arts and culture.\nAnd because of our good work, we continue to be recognized. We were recently named one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek, one of the world's top female-friendly companies by Forbes and as a Best of the Best Employer for the ninth consecutive year by the Military Times.\nWith our strong start to the year in the face of challenging operating conditions, we are reaffirming our sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2022. We expect net sales to be between $11.7 million and $12.5 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be between $1.87 and $2.03 per share.\nOur outlook for the remainder of the year assumes, among other things, elevated levels of demand across our go-to-market channels; margin improvement from our efforts to combat inflation, including pricing actions and a positive shift in mix; strength from our high-growth brands and businesses, including Columbus, Applegate and foodservice; continued Plant's performance at the high end of our expectations; improved supply chain performance as labor pressures ease; and the benefit of new capacity for dry sausage, pizza toppings, bacon and other value-added products.\nI believe our team has always had a keen competency to evolve and adapt as conditions change. We have certainly improved upon this competency over the last 2 years and we were able to leverage it again to drive growth in the first quarter. I expect our team will continue to navigate and overcome the challenging operating environment to deliver our growth goals this year. Our results-focused mentality is just another factor that makes our company and our Inspire team members (inaudible).\nAt this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss financial information relating to the quarter and provide more color on key drivers to our outlook.\n\nJacinth C. Smiley\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hormel Foods Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I want to echo Jim's comments on how proud I am of our entire team and how we collectively rose above the challenges we encountered in the first quarter.\nDuring the first quarter, we delivered record sales of $3 billion, a 24% increase. Organic sales increased 13% for the quarter. Gross profit increased $89 million compared to last year, a 20% increase. This improvement was driven by strength in Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and the addition of the Planters snack nuts business.\nGross profit margin was 17.7% compared to 18.3% last year. Pricing actions across all businesses did not fully offset double-digit increases in freight expenses and continued supply chain disruptions. We are encouraged by the quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross margin as our pricing initiatives catch up with the dramatic inflation we have seen over the past year.\nWe increased advertising investments in all 4 segments to support the Planters, SPAM, Jennie-O and SKIPPY brands as well as the Hormel pepperoni and Hormel chili product line. For the quarter, advertising expense increased by 38% or approximately $0.02 per share.\nSG&A expenses increased 15% compared to last year due to the addition of the Planters snack nuts Snape business and higher advertising investments for our brands. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased to 7.4% from 8% last year. This speaks to our strong sales growth and disciplined cost management.\nOperating income increased 19% to $320 million. Operating margins were 10.5% compared to 10.9% last year. Operating margin increased sequentially from 10.4% in the fourth quarter.\nInterest expense increased $6 million compared to last year, driven by the debt we took out in June to fund the acquisition of the Planters snack nut business We expect a similar amount of interest expense for each quarter during fiscal 2022.\nOur effective tax rate increased to 22.4% from 19.7% last year, a 270 basis points increase. Last year's tax rate benefited from a state tax settlement. Our effective tax rate guidance of 20.5% to 22.5% is unchanged from our prior outlook.\nThe net result of all these factors was diluted earnings per share of $0.44, a 7% increase over $0.41 last year.\nTurning to our segment results. Three of our 4 segments delivered sales and profit growth, which is a testament to our balanced business model. In total, segment profit increased by 13% as growth in Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Jennie-O Turkey Store more than offset the decline in International.\nRefrigerated Foods volume decreased 4% (inaudible) agreement to reduce our exposure to low-margin commodity pork business. Sales increased 19%, and organic sales increased 17%. Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 15%, led by the strength in our foodservice business and decisive pricing actions we took across many of our branded businesses. (inaudible) was able to overcome double-digit increases in freight rates and significant supply chain challenges to deliver this impressive result.\nLike prior quarters, Refrigerated Foods continues to be negatively affected by production constraints due to labor challenges. Market conditions for key inputs such as hogs, bellies, pork trim and beef trim remained elevated and above year ago levels. Further, most markets increased throughout the quarter, which can cause margins to narrow as our pricing catches up with input costs. Looking at the first month of the second quarter, we continue to see increases in hogs, cutout and belly prices. Elevated levels of domestic and international demand, low levels of cold storage and industry-wide labor shortages continue to be material factors affecting protein production.\nGrocery Products volume increased 22% and sales increased 48% due to the addition of the Planters snack nuts business. Organic volume increased 1% and organic sales increased 7%. Segment profit increased 8% due primarily to the addition of the Planters snack nuts business. This more than offset a decline at our MegaMex joint venture due to steep increases in avocado prices and significant increases in freight, steel, aluminum and other supply chain costs across the business. Production constraints also limited our growth in volume, sales and segment profit.\nJennie-O Turkey Store had an excellent quarter, with sales up 15% and segment profit up 62%. Improvements in foodservice, increased whole bird shipments and pricing actions across all categories contributed to the performance.\nLike our other businesses, Jennie-O Turkey Store also absorbed higher logistics and supply chain costs. Feed costs increased by over 35% compared to last year. We took decisive action last year to hedge most of our grain costs, which protects us from major shifts in market prices (inaudible)\nthe international COVID-19-related restrictions in China and U.S. export logistics challenges, volume decreased 17% and organic volume decreased 19%. Sales decreased 3% and organic sales decreased 6%. Segment profit declined 19% due to lower sales and logistics challenges. We see the current challenges as more transient in nature and remain optimistic about our international growth opportunities.\nTurning to cash flow. Operating cash flow from the first quarter increased 87% to $384 million. Capital expenditures were $50 million compared to $40 million last year. Our target for capital expenditures in 2022 is unchanged at $310 million.\nWe paid our 374th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $1.04 per share, a 6% increase over last year. Dividend growth remains a high priority.\nWe did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We will repurchase shares opportunistically based on our internal valuation.\nWe ended the first quarter with $3.3 billion in debt or approximately 2.3x EBITDA. Although no mandatory debt repayments are required until 2024, based on our strong and consistent cash flow, we expect to make incremental payments as soon as the second half of 2022. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating and deleveraging to 1.5 to 2x EBITDA by 2023.\nAs Jim mentioned, we are reaffirming our sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2022. A key factor in our outlook is the ongoing complexity of the current operating environment. We are managing several key factors, including input cost inflation and the performance of our upstream and downstream supply chain. We see elevated demand, both domestically and abroad, but disruptions from both suppliers and logistics partners are impacting our ability to fully meet the demand.\nOur One Supply Chain team continues to improve the hiring and retention of team members and has developed many innovative strategies to mitigate the effect of labor shortages. With the strong demand that we continue to see across all our businesses, we are maximizing our production flexibility to produce the items that are most in demand, increasing internal capacity, leveraging our co-manufacturing partnerships to increase throughput and making improvements to transportation load factors.\nWe have been combating extreme input cost volatility and inflation over the past 2 years. Our experienced management team has done an excellent job managing profitability through multiple rounds of pricing actions, effective management of promotional expenses, strategic shifts in product mix and disciplined management of SG&A. Financially, the actions our team is taking should result in quarter-over-quarter improvement in operating margins throughout fiscal 2022.\nDuring my first quarter as Chief Financial Officer, I have been incredibly impressed with the accountability, commitment to results and pride I see across our entire company. This gives me even more confidence in our ability to deliver growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of this call.",

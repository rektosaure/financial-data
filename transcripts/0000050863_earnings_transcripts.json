Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn William Pitzer\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window.\nI am joined today by our CEO, Lip-Bu Tan; and our CFO, David Zinsner, Lip-Bu will open up with comments on our third quarter results as well as provide an update on our progress implementing strategic priorities. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including fourth quarter guidance. Before we transition to answer your questions.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also can references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, let me turn things over to Lip-Bu.\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, John, and let me add my welcome this afternoon. we delivered a solid Q3 with revenue, gross margin, earnings per share above guidance. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of improved execution delivered by the underwriting growth in our core markets and the steady progress we are making to rebuild the company. While we are still a long way to go we are taking the right steps to create sustainable shareholder value. We significantly improved our cash position and liquidity in Q3. A key focus for me since becoming CEO in March.\nThis includes accelerated funding from the United States government, important investments from NVIDIA and SoftBank Group and monetizing portion of Altera and Mobileye. The action we took to strengthen the balance sheet, give us greater operational flexibility and position us well to continue to execute our strategy with confidence. In particular, I'm honored by the trust and confident President Trump and Secretary Lutnick had place in me. Their support highlights Intel strategic role as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company with leading-edge logic, R&D and manufacturing.\nWe are fully committed to advancing the Trump administration's vision to restoring semiconductor production and proudly welcome the U.S. government as an essential partners in our efforts. We also made tangible progress to improve our execution this quarter. We remain on track, not only to rightsize the company by year-end, but also to evolve the talent mix, reestablish the engineering-first mindset and optimize the executive and management levels across the organization.\nWe are seeing a significant increase in day-to-day energy and collaborations as our employees return to office after a sustained period of remote and hybrid work. Let me dive deeper into our underlying business trend. Over the course of my career, I have had privilege of contributing multiple ways of disruptive innovation. But I can't recall a time that I have been more excited about the future of computing and opportunities in front of us. We are still in the early stage of AI revolution, and I believe Intel can and will play a much more significant role as we transform the company.\nLet's start with our core x86 franchise, which continues to play a critical role in the age of AI. AI is clearly accelerating demand for new compute architectures, hardware models and algorithms. At the same time is fueling renewed growth of traditional compute as the underwriting data and the resulting insights continue to rely heavily on our existing products from cloud to edge. AI is driving near-term upside to our business, and it is a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth as we execute. In addition, with unmatched compatibility, security and flexibility by virtue of being the largest installed base of general purpose compute x86 is well positioned to power the hybrid compute environment that AI workloads demand, particularly for inference edge workloads and Agentic system.\nIt is a great starting point from which to rebuild our market position to revitalizing and rejuvenating the x86 and positioning for the new era of computing with great products and partnerships. Our collaboration with NVIDIA is a prime example. We are joining forces to create a new class of products and experience, spanning multiple generation that accelerate the adoption of AI for the hyperscale, enterprise and consumer markets.\nBy connecting our architectures to NVIDIA NV link we combined Intel CPU and x86 leadership with NVIDIA unmatched AI and accelerated computing strength, unlocking innovative solutions that will deliver better customer experience and provide a big hit for Intel in the leading AI platform of tomorrow. We need to continue to build on this momentum and capitalize on our position by improving our engineering and design execution.\nThis includes hiring promoting top architecture talent as well as reimagining our core road map to ensure it is the best-in-class features. To accelerate this effort, we recently created the Central Engineering Group, which will unify our horizontal engineering functions to drive leverage across foundational IP development, test chip design, EDA tools and design platforms. This new structure will eliminate duplications, improve time to decision-making and enhance coherence across all product development.\nIn addition and just as important, the group will spearhead the build-out of our new ASIC and design service business to deliver purpose-built silicon for a broad range of external customers. This will not only extend the reach of our core x86 IP, but also leverage our design strength to deliver an array of solutions from general purpose to fixed function computing.\nIn client, we are on track to launch our first Panther Lake SKU by year-end, followed by additional SKUs in the first half of next year. This will help us to solidify our strong position in the notebook segment across both consumer and enterprise with cost-optimized products across our full PC stack from our entry-level offering to our mainstream core family, up through our highest-performing core ultra family. In high-end desktop, competition remains intense, but we are making steady progress. Arrow Lake shipments have increased throughout the year. and our next-generation Nova Lake product, new architecture and software upgrades to further strengthen our offerings, particularly in the PC gaming space.\nWith this lineup, we believe we will have the strongest PC portfolio in yields. In traditional service, AI workloads are driving both refresh of the installed base and capacity expansion, fueled by rapid growth in tokenization the increased demand around data storage and processing and a need to elevate power and space constraints. We remain the AI hit notes of choice with strong demand for granite rapids, including instances across every major hyperscalers. We are listening to what customers need and strong performance per ward and TCO are top of mind.\nAs I shared with you last quarter, the key part, including improving our multi-trading capabilities as we close existing gap and work to regain shares. Finally, on our AI accelerator strategy, I continue to believe that we can play a meaningful role in developing compute platforms for emerging influence workloads driven by Agentic AI and physical AI. This will be a far larger market than that for AI training workloads. We will work to position Intel as a compute platform of choice for AI inference and we look to partner with a raise of incumbents as well as emerging companies that are defining this new compute paradigm.\nThis is a multiyear initiative and we will strike partnership when we can deliver true differentiation and market-leading products. In the near term, we will continue delivering AI capabilities to Xeon, AIPC, Arc and our open soft West. Looking ahead, we plan to launch successive generation of inference-optimized GPUs on the annual cadence that features enhanced memory and bandwidth to meet enterprise needs.\nTurning to Intel Foundry, our momentum continues. We are making steady progress on Intel 18A. We are on track to bring Panther Lake to market this year. Intel 18A use are progressing at a predictable rate and Fab52 in Arizona, which is dedicated to high-volume manufacturing is now fully operational. In addition, we are advancing our work on Intel 18AP, and we continue to hit our PDK milestones. Our Intel 18A family is the foundation for at least next 3 generation of client and server products. I will work with U.S. government within the secure and grit and other committed customers.\nIt is a critical note that will drive wafer volumes well into the next decade, and generate a healthy return on our investment. On Intel 14A, the team continued to focus on technology definition, sister architecture, process flow, design enablement and foundation IP. We remain active, engaged with potential external customers and are encouraged by the earlier feedback which help us to drive and inform our decisions.\nLastly, our advanced packaging activities continue to progress well, especially in the area like EMIB and EMIB T, which we have 2 differentiations. Like our Intel products, my conviction in the market potential for Intel Foundry continue to grow. The rapid expansion of critical AI infrastructure is fueling unprecedented demand for wafer capacity and advanced packaging services that presents a substantial opportunity demanding multiple suppliers. Intel foundry is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this unprecedented demand as we execute. As I mentioned last quarter, our investment in foundry will be disciplined, and we will focus on capability and scalability, giving us flexibility to ramp quickly and we will only add capacity when we have committed external demand. Building a world-class foundry is a long-term effort founded on trust.\nAs a foundry, we need to ensure that our process can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with a unique way of building their own products. We must learn to delight our customers as they call on us to build wafers to meet all their needs for performance, yield, cost and schedule. This is only by doing this that they can rely on us as a true long-term partner to ensure their success. This requires a change of mindset that I'm driving across Intel Foundry as we position this business for long-term success.\nAs we look ahead, my focus remains firmly on the long-term opportunity across every market we serve today and those we will enter tomorrow. Our strategy is crystallized around our unique strength and value proposition, supported by the accelerating and unprecedented demand for compute in the AI-driven economy. Our leadership continues to strengthen. Our culture is becoming more accountable, collaborative and execution-oriented. And my confidence in the future grow stronger every day. I look forward to keep you updated as we advance our journey.\nI will now turn it over to Dave for detail on our current business trends and financials.\n\nDavid A. Zinsner\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lip-Bu. In Q3, we delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue above our guidance, driven by continued strength in our core markets. Although we remain vigilant regarding macroeconomic volatility, customer purchasing behavior and inventory levels are healthy and industry supply has tightened materially. Furthermore, we are increasingly confident that the rapid adoption of AI is driving growth in traditional compute and reinforcing momentum across our businesses.\nIn client, we are 5 years post the COVID pull forward and are benefiting from the refresh of a larger installed base. Enterprises continue to migrate to Windows 11, and AIPC adoption is growing. In data center, the accelerating build-out of AI infrastructure is positive for server CPU demand from head nodes, inference, orchestration layers and storage. We are cautiously optimistic that the CPU TAM will continue to grow in 2026 even as we have work to do to improve our competitive position.\nThird quarter revenue was $13.7 billion, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and up 6% sequentially. Capacity constraints, especially on Intel 10 and Intel 7 limited our ability to fully meet demand in Q3 for both data center and client products. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40%, 4 percentage points better than our guidance on higher revenue, a more favorable mix and lower inventory reserves, partially offset by higher volume of Lunar Lake and the early ramp of Intel 18A.\nWe delivered third quarter earnings per share of $0.23 versus our guidance of breakeven EPS driven by higher revenue, stronger gross margins and continued cost discipline. Q3 operating cash flow was $2.5 billion with gross CapEx of $3 billion in the quarter, and positive adjusted free cash flow of $900 million. One of our top priorities for 2025 was shoring up our balance sheet. To that end, we executed on deals to secure roughly $20 billion of cash, including 3 important strategic partnerships. We exited Q3 with $30.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. In Q3, we received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government, $2 billion from SoftBank Group, $4.3 billion from the Altera closure and $900 million from the Mobileye stake sale.\nWe expect NVIDIA's $5 billion investment to close by the end of Q4. Finally, we repaid $4.3 billion of debt in the quarter and we will continue prioritizing deleveraging by paying maturities as they come due in 2026.\nMoving to segment results for Q3. Intel products revenue was $12.7 billion, up 7% sequentially and above our expectations across client and server. The team executed well to support upside in the quarter given the current tight capacity environment, which we expect to persist into 2026. We are working closely with customers to maximize our available output, including adjusting pricing and mix to shift demand towards products where we have supply and they have demand. CCG revenue was $8.5 billion, up 8% quarter-over-quarter and above our expectation due to a seasonally stronger TAM, Windows 11 driven refresh and a stronger pricing mix with the ramp of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake.\nWithin the quarter, CCG further advanced its relationship with Microsoft through a collaboration with Windows ML and the deep integration of Intel vPro manageability with Microsoft Intune enabling secure cloud connected fleet management for businesses of all sizes. The team also met all key milestones in support of launching Core Ultra 3 co-named Panther Lake. We expect the client consumption TAM to approach 290 million units in 2025 and marking 2 straight years of growth of the post-COVID bottom in 2023. This represents the fastest TAM growth since 2021, and we're prudently preparing for another year of strong demand in 2026 as Core Ultra 3 ramps into a healthy PC ecosystem.\nPCAI revenue was $4.1 billion up 5% sequentially, above expectations, driven by improved product mix and higher enterprise demand. The strength in host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute continued in the quarter even as supply constraints limited additional upside. Our latest Xeon 6 processors, code-named Granite Rapids offer significant benefits, including up to 68% TCO savings and up to 80% less power as compared to the average server install base. It is increasingly clear that CPUs play a critical role today and will going forward within the AI data center as AI usage expands and especially as inference workloads outpaced that of training. Some data center customers are beginning to ask about longer-term strategic supply agreements to support their business goals due to the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure.\nThis dynamic, combined with the underinvestment in traditional infrastructure over the last couple of years should enable the revenue TAM for server CPUs to comfortably grow going forward. Operating profit for Intel Products was $3.7 billion, 29% of revenue and up $972 million quarter-over-quarter on stronger product margin, lower operating expenses and a favorable compare due to period costs in Q2.\nBefore discussing Intel Foundry, I want to acknowledge the tireless effort of the NVIDIA and Intel teams. There's a lot of work in front of us, but the collaboration we announced this quarter was the culmination of almost a year of hard work with a company that cuts no corners and prioritizes engineering excellence of all. The x86 architecture has been the foundation of the digital revolution that powers the modern world. AI is the next phase of that revolution, and we're on a path to ensure x86 remains at the heart of it. Engage like this one with NVIDIA are critical to this effort.\nMoving to Intel Foundry. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, down 4% sequentially. In Q3, Intel foundry delivered Intel 10 and 7 volume above expectations, met key 18A milestones and released hardened 18AP Ks to the ecosystem. Foundry also advanced the development of Intel 14A and continues to make progress expanding its advanced packaging deal pipeline. Intel Foundry operating loss in Q3 was $2.3 billion, better by $847 million sequentially primarily on favorable comparison due to the approximately $800 million impairment charge in Q2. As Lip-Bu discussed, our confidence in the long-term foundry TAM continues to grow, bolstered by accelerating deployment and adoption of AI and the growing need for wafers and advanced packaging services. Projections are calling for a greater than 10x increase of gigawatts of AI capacity by 2030, creating significant opportunities for Intel foundry with external customers, both for wafers and our differentiated advanced packaging capabilities like EMIB T.\nWe continue the work to earn our customers and our improved balance sheet flexibility will allow us to quickly and responsibly respond to demand as it comes. Turning to -- all Other. Revenue came in at $1 billion, of which Alterra contributed $386 million and was down 6% sequentially due to the intra-quarter closure of Altera. The 3 primary components of all other in Q3 were Mobileye, Altera and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $100 million of operating profit.\nNow turning to guidance. For Q4, we're forecasting a revenue range of $12.8 billion to $13.8 billion. At the midpoint, and adjusting for the Altera deconsolidation, Q4's revenue is roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. We expect Intel products up modestly sequentially, but below customer demand as we continue to navigate supply environment. Within Intel products, we expect CCG to be down modestly and DCAI to be up strongly sequentially as we prioritize wafer capacity for service shipments over entry-level client parts. We expect Intel Foundry revenue up quarter-over-quarter on increased Intel 18A revenue and its external foundry revenue up due to the deconsolidation of Alterra.\nFor all other which now excludes Altera, we expect revenue to decline consistent with mobilized guidance, partially offset by sequential growth in ES. At the midpoint of $13.3 billion, we forecast a gross margin of approximately 36.5% down sequentially due to product mix, the impact of the first shipments of Core Ultra 3, which has the typically higher costs you see in the early stages of a new product ramp and the deconsolidation of Altera. We forecast a tax rate of [ 4% ] and EPS of $0.08. And all on a non-GAAP basis. We expect noncontrolled income to be approximately $350 million to $400 million in Q4 on a GAAP basis, and we forecast average fully diluted share count of roughly 5 billion shares for Q4.\nMoving to CapEx. We continue to anticipate 2025 gross capital investment will be approximately $18 billion and we expect to deploy more than $27 billion of CapEx in 2025 versus $17 billion deployed in 2024. I'll wrap up by saying we exit Q3 with a significantly stronger balance sheet, solid demand in the near term and growing confidence in our core x86 franchise as well as the longer-term opportunities in Foundry, ASICs and accelerators. We also recognize the work we need to reach our full potential. We continue to add external talent and unlock our workforce to improve our execution across product and process development as well as manufacturing.\nWe will closely manage what's in our control, react quickly as the environment evolves and focus on delivering long-term shareholder value.\nAt this time, I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 11 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today.\nBy now you should have received a copy of the Q2 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO Lip-Bu Tan and by our CFO David Zinsner. Lip-Bu Tan will open with comments on our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our strategy and priorities. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including third quarter guidance, before we transition to answer your questions before we begin. Please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.\nOur earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and let me add my welcome. We had a solid Q2 with revenue above the high end of our guidance. This reflects strong demand across our business and good execution by the team. As expected, headline profitability was impacted by several one-time items, and impairments, but I am pleased by the underlying operating performance in the quarter even as we have more work to do. Dave will go through our detailed financials shortly.\nToday I want to provide you with updates on four major initiatives where we have started to make progress and will continue to focus in coming quarters. Our organization and culture, our foundry strategy, our core x86 franchise, and our AI strategy. First, on organization and culture. Over the last three months I have completed a systematic review of every organization and function reporting to the CEO. These reviews included detailed analysis of head count, skill sets, spending, site distribution, executive population, and restructuring plans. We have much work to do in building a clean and streamlined organization, which we have started in earnest and it remained an area of focus for me during Q3.\nOur goal is to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies and increase accountability at every level of the company. As mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we need to right size and scale back the company while ensuring that we are retaining our best internal talents and hiring the best external talents from industry and universities. During Q2, we completed the majority of the actions needed to achieve our year end target of 75,000 employees. These were hard but necessary decisions and we reduced management layers by approximately 50% in the process. We are on track to implement our return to office mandate starting September. These actions are necessary not just to reduce our operating expenses, but to make the company more agile, collaborative, and vibrant to simplify our business and improve our product and process execution.\nNext on our Foundry strategy, I continue to believe that our heritage and expertise in semiconductor technology development and manufacturing remains a very valuable and vital asset. I also fully appreciate the strategic importance of the U.S.-domiciled semiconductor manufacturing.\nTransforming this unique asset into a robust foundry business requires us to take a systematic approach and act from the position of strength. The foundry business is a service business that relies on foundational principle of trust. We need to demonstrate to our customers that we can deliver wafers on time with high quality, reliability, and yield, that we can manufacture their products at scale. We need to have process and packaging technology that is not only competitive but more importantly is designed to meet the needs of customers. In addition, we also need to develop a rich and diverse ecosystem of IP and EDA partners who will enable our customer to seamlessly design chips using our process. Finally, perhaps most importantly, we need to build capacity smartly and carefully on a schedule that meets the needs of our customers and supports the economics of our business.\nThis approach is fundamentally different than the path we have been on for the last four years. Unfortunately, the capacity investment we made over the last several years were well ahead of demand and were unwise and excessive. Our factory footprint has become needlessly fragmented. Going forward, we will grow our capacity based solely on the volume commitments, and deploy CapEx lockstep with the tangible milestones and not before.\nAs part of this new financial discipline, we have decided not to continue with our manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland. We also plan to consolidate our assembly and test operation in Costa Rica into larger existing sites in Vietnam and Malaysia, and we will further slow the pace of construction in Ohio to ensure our spending is aligned with market demand. Importantly, based on the progress we have already made in Ohio, we have flexibility to accelerate work as needed to meet customer needs.\nFunding specifically to process technology development on Intel 18A, we will continue make steady progress on our yield and performance targets. Intel 18A is the foundation of at least next three generations of Intel client and server products, and we remain committed to ramping this technology to scale. Intel 18A and Intel 18AP are critical nodes for Intel products and will drive meaningful wafer volumes well into the next decade.\nOur foundry and products teams remain focused on enabling Panther Lake to launch this year. Once we get our own product ramping in high volume, we will be in better position to attract external customers to this technology.\nThe Intel 18A family is also important as we continue to advance our work for the U.S. Government within the Secure Enclave program as well as for other initial committed customers.\nOn Intel 14A, the foundry technology team is continuing to focus on the basic building blocks, technology definitions and transistor architecture, process flow design enablement, PDKs, foundational IPs, and test chips to validate and improve performance and defect density.\nDesigning 14A at its inception as a foundry node from the ground up better positions us to meet specific customer requirements and address a broadened segment of the market. This work is being driven and informed by direct input from large external customers and from our own internal products teams.\nA key aspect of prudently pursuing our foundry ambition is also making sure we maintain sensible optionality for our internal product teams. They will continue to work closely with both internal and external foundry partners. They will do their homework and make process and supplier decisions based on what is best for our end customers against criteria of performance, cost, yield, and time to market.\nOur external foundry strategy has always been rooted in the economic reality of semiconductor manufacturing up to and through Intel 18A. We could generate a reasonable return on our investments with only Intel products. The increase in capital cost at Intel 14A make it clear that we need both Intel products and a meaningful external customer to drive acceptable returns on our deployed capital, and I will only invest when I'm confident those returns exist. I'm intimately familiar with the foundry and Fabless ecosystem, having helped create it over the last two decades. I'm using that experience to put our Intel foundry on a more solid footing for the future. I will do so while being prudent with our capital and ensure we can deliver attractive returns on the investment we make. I do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it they will come under my leadership.\nWe will build what customers need when they need it and earn their trust to consistent execution.\non to our core x86 franchise in client, our top priority is delivering our first Panther Lake SKU by year-end, followed by additional SKUs in the first half of 2026. The successful launch of the Panther Lake will solidify our strong share in the notebook market across consumer, and enterprise. We still have gaps to close in the high-end desktop market, but I'm encouraged by our unmatched go-to-market reach, our x86 ecosystem, and the progress we are making on Nova Lake due out at the end of 2026.\nIn traditional servers we continue to have solid position in AI host nodes and storage where our single threaded performance has been optimized for those workloads. Granite Rapids is ramping as planned and we continue to see good demand for our more established server products, but sustainable share improvement in this market will take time. Specifically we need to improve in broader hyperscale workloads where performance per watt is key differentiator.\nI have also taken steps to correct past mistakes regarding multithreading capabilities on our P-cores. I'm also making progress on bringing in new leadership in our data center business, and look forward to being able to announce these changes next quarter. Longer term, my directive to our silicon and platform teams is to define products with clean and simple architecture, better cost structure to simplify our SKU stack, all while enabling a path to robust product margin. I'm also instituting a policy where every major chip design needs to be personally reviewed and approved by me before tape-out. I have already begun this process. This discipline will improve our execution speed and move up towards a first-time-right mindset while also saving development costs.\nFinally, turning to AI, in the past we approached AI with a traditional silicon and training centric mindset without a cohesive silicon systems, software stack and strategy. While we do need to build and consolidate upon our silicon franchise based upon our x86 CPU and our Xe GPUs, we recognize the need to move up the abstraction stack into system and software. This is the area where Intel has traditionally been weak or entirely absent, but we intend to incubate and grow these important skill sets and capabilities under my leadership. This will take time, but it will be vital for Intel to stay relevant in the next wave of computing. In addition, we see the AI market continuing to evolve, and we are concentrating our effort on areas we believe we can disrupt and differentiate like inference and agentic AI.\nWe need to start by first understanding emerging and real AI workloads, then work backwards to design software systems and silicon to enable best outcome for those particular workloads. We will strive to become the compute platform of choice, but we will also work towards a full stack AI solution, and I look forward to sharing more on our strategy in the coming months. Underpinning all of these efforts is a strong focus on improving our balance sheet. We continue to maintain solid liquidity, but despite meaningful capital spending offsets, our last full fiscal year of positive adjusted free cash flow was 2021. This is completely unacceptable. How we allocate our owners' capital and the return we generate for them are of paramount importance to me. We have several major levers to generate better cash flow, including driving operating leverage and managing our capital outlays.\nI discussed earlier the action we have taken to reduce operating expenses and improve execution. I'm very confident in our ability to hit our operating expenses targets for 2025 and 2026 respectively.\nWe have already lowered our CapEx guidance from the beginning of the year by roughly $5 billion year to date. While purchasing commitments make further reduction in 2025 difficult, we will continue to work to reduce capital spending in 2026. Lastly, as it relates to our non-core assets, we successfully monetize a portion of our ownership of Mobileye earlier this month, and we look forward to closing the Altera transaction with Silver Lake this quarter. I will evaluate other opportunities as we continue to sharpen our focus around our core business and strategy. I believe the actions we have taken during my first few months are steering us in the right direction. That said, I also know that turning the company around will take time and require patience.\nWe have a lot to fix in order to move the company forward and I'm determined to drive the changes necessary to improve our performance.\nI am optimistic that as we execute, we will rebuild this company and have a bright future. I will now turn it over to Dave to go into more detail on the financials.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Lip-Bu.\nI'll start by characterizing the prevailing market conditions in Q2. On our Q1 earnings call, we signaled the economic landscape had become increasingly uncertain, driven by shifting trade policies, persistent inflation concerns, and increased regulatory risk. Fortunately, markets largely functioned normally in Q2, enabling the fundamental demand drivers underpinning our core markets to manifest in client. We saw continued solid demand driven by the end of Service for Windows 10 and the aging COVID-era installed base. In addition, AI PCs continued to grow as a percentage of our mix. On the traditional server side, we saw hyperscalers and enterprises continue to refresh their CPU installed base to take advantage of our newer products with better performance within a lower power envelope. Both dynamics underscore the durable demand within our two largest markets and the enduring strength of the x86 ecosystem.\nSecond quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, coming in above the high end of our guidance range driven by strength across client and data center. Similar to comments we made in Q4 and Q1, we think it's likely Q2 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior to mitigate tariff uncertainty, although it continues to be difficult to quantify. Turning to non-GAAP gross margins and EPS, last quarter we indicated that incremental costs associated with our spending reduction plan would likely impact non-GAAP gross margin, but since those costs were not yet calculated, they were not included in our Q2 gross margin and EPS guidance of 36.5% and breakeven, respectively. As such, we recognized approximately $800 million of non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges related to excess prior generation tools for which we couldn't find reuse and approximately $200 million of one-time period costs.\nThese charges resulted in Q2 gross margin of 29.7% and EPS of -$0.10. Excluding these charges, our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 37.5% and non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.10, both results ahead of our Q2 guidance. Beyond those costs, we also were impacted by $1.9 billion of charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. The large majority of those charges are associated with the severance for our headcount reduction aligned with our restructuring plan. We expect the principal cash cost associated with the restructuring charges to land in Q3 2025. While difficult, these decisions have us firmly on track to meet our calendar year 2025 and calendar year 2026 OpEx targets of $17 billion and $16 billion respectively.\nQ2 operating cash flow was $2.1 billion with gross CapEx of $4.5 billion in the quarter, and net CapEx of $3.1 billion resulting in adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.1 billion. We have $21.2 billion of cash and short-term investments and remain focused on beginning the process of delevering this year as cash from operations continues to improve. Moving to segment results for Q2, Intel Products revenue was $11.8 billion, up slightly sequentially and above our expectations across client and server. I was pleased by the team's ability to support revenue upside in the quarter as capacity for Intel 7 remains very tight. CCG revenue was up 3% quarter over quarter and above our expectation, with continued PC refresh demand and upside in edge deployments.\nWithin the quarter, CCG launched a number of AI PCs with key OEM partners, announced the expansion of its Arc GPUs for AI use cases tailored to inference and professional workstations, and made its OpenEdge platform code available to the developer community, all in support of the growing opportunity for us to compete as AI inference moves to the edge. DCAI revenue was down 5% sequentially but above expectations, driven by variability in hyperscale demand, partially offset by continued strength in host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute. In addition, we saw upside to plan on the continued ramp of Xeon 6, code named Granite Rapids. In Q2, DCAI launched three new Xeon 6 processors with Priority Core Turbo technology to boost AI workloads.\nOne of these Xeon 6 SKUs was selected as the host node for Nvidia DGX B300AI accelerated systems, and Imperial College London chose Xeon 6 to power its latest HPC supercomputer, demonstrating Xeon remains the CPU of choice for AI workloads. Operating profit for Intel products was $2.7 billion, 23% of revenue, and down $250 million quarter over quarter, principally driven by the period costs I highlighted earlier.\nIntel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.4 billion, down 5% sequentially, and above expectations on better than forecasted output of Intel 7 wafers and increased advanced packaging services in Q2. 18A reached a key milestone with the start of production wafers in Arizona ahead of Intel products. Q4 launch of its next generation client product codenamed Panther Lake. Intel Foundry released an early version of Intel 14A's PDK to lead external customers, and at Direct Connect in April announced an EMIB advanced packaging partnership with Amcor. Intel Foundry operating loss in Q2 was $3.2 billion, down $848 million sequentially, materially driven by the $800 million impairment charges I discussed earlier. Turning to all other, revenue came in at $1.1 billion and was up 12% sequentially and above expectations. The three primary components of all other are Mobileye, Altera, and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $69 million of operating profit.\nNow turning to guidance, historically sequential growth in Q3 has been up high single digits. However, we've seen three out of four quarters of revenue growth above our expectations, which we attribute at least in part to customers hedging against tariff uncertainty. As such, while we believe the underlying fundamentals of our core markets support growth, we feel it prudent to continue to plan for a below seasonal second half of 2025. For Q3, we're forecasting a revenue range of $12.6-$13.6 billion, down 2% to up 6%. Sequentially, within Intel products, we expect more strength in CCG. We expect Intel Foundry revenue down slightly quarter over quarter due to capacity constraints in Intel 7, which we expect to persist through the second half of the year, and reduced expectations for external advanced packaging revenue.\nFor all other, we expect revenue for the sum of those parts to be roughly flat sequentially at the midpoint of $13.1 billion. We expect a gross margin of approximately 36% on an increased mix of outsourced products, the early ramp of Panther Lake, and increased costs associated with tariffs. We forecast a tax rate of 12% and breakeven EPS, all on a non-GAAP basis.\nWe're forecasting 2025 OpEx of $17 billion with a 2026 OpEx target of $16 billion. We expect non-controlling interest, or NCI, to be approximately $250-$300 million in both Q3 and Q4 on a GAAP basis. NCI is still expected to grow meaningfully in fiscal year 2026. In Q2, we took tangible steps to increase focus on our core business while leveraging non-core assets to shore up the balance sheet. We raised approximately $900 million through the Mobileye offering, and we are on track to complete the stake sale of Altera in Q3. Our guidance includes Altera for the full quarter, but we will deconsolidate at deal close. Once the deconsolidation is complete, we will recognize our remaining Altera investment within equity investments on the balance sheet.\nOn the income statement, we will recognize our proportional share of Altera's net income on a one-quarter lag through gains and losses on equity investments, net, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. As a result, it is likely our Q3 non-GAAP results will reflect only a portion of the financial results for Altera. Moving to CapEx, we anticipate 2025 gross capital investment will be approximately $18 billion and forecast $8-$11 billion for net CapEx. Better utilization of our construction in progress will allow us to deploy more overall CapEx in 2025 than in 2024, and we expect the improved utilization to continue in 2026, resulting in lower gross and net CapEx next year. Beginning the process of delevering our balance sheet in 2025 remains a top priority for us.\nI'll wrap up by saying Q2 operationally was the third consecutive solid quarter, reflecting our commitment to maintain a high SEI do ratio, closely manage what's in our control, and react quickly as the environment evolves. I have confidence that the strategic priorities we've established are the right ones, and I'm optimistic about our ability to execute on them while acknowledging there are no quick fixes. With that, I'll turn over to John to start the Q and A.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q and A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Let me, the first one's for you, and thank you for walking through the strategic details that you're putting into place. It seems like fixing the foundry side is based on trust, as you said before, and that trust seems has its origin in fixing the x86 side of the business. I guess my question is how fast can you fix that? I know you are having to sign off on every tape out, but is the trust that 18A can ramp dependent upon Nova Lake and Diamond Rapids? Are we talking 2027, 2028? What are the sort of steps we need to see to build that trust in your x86 business so that the foundry business can ramp?\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, thank you so much for a good question. First of all, we focus on the 18A. So far, the last two months, I have twice a week review with the team, and we make steady progress on our technology towards the yield, performance target, and reliability. I think, as you mentioned, 18A is the foundation for at least three generations of our Intel client and server business products, and we are committed to ramp that. So far, you know, what gives me the confidence is we are engaging with external ecosystem partners to help us to look at the yield and how we can improve, and that in the past we did not engage that.\nI really see that, you know, for feedback from the partners that, hey, the culture, the intensity for our team is really focused on the yield performance, and they really like the attitude on that. So far, I think it gives me a lot of confidence that we can launch our Panther Lake SKU by the end of the year. I also think the external customer includes Secure Enclave with the U.S. Government, and then with the sufficient internal volume and then showing the good progress, we can have a better attraction to our external customer. I think this is a process to kind of build the trust with the customer. They can count on us on the reliability, the yield, and we can deliver on time, on scale, to really supporting them.\nThey're going to just put the resources on their revenue based on our foundry. There is a lot of responsibility for us to deliver with high quality. That's something that I feel very committed, and we like what we, I see. It gives me a lot more confidence.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a follow-up question?\nPlease do.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nOne potentially a little nearer term for Dave, on the gross margin side, you mentioned that the gross margin was guided down a bit sequentially for a couple different reasons. Can you dive a little deeply and a little more deeply into those? Perhaps more importantly, just what do you see as the tailwinds and headwinds to gross margin as we look, say, into next year? I know you're not going to guide it specifically, but just some of the puts and takes would be great.\nThank you.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, okay, thanks, Ross. Yeah, let's just delve into the gross margins for the third quarter. I'd say the predominant driver of the lower gross margins in the third quarter is Lunar Lake. We expect a pretty significant ramp in Lunar Lake in the third quarter. You know, I've made this comment I think multiple times on calls, but it's got the memory in the package. You know, we kind of pass it on at the same cost we bought it. That really has a negative impact on the way the gross margins look optically. As we mix higher to Lunar Lake, that's obviously going to be a headwind to us in terms of gross margins, as expected. Perhaps having a little bit more of a significant transition from Q2-Q3. We thought we'd have probably more volume in Q2.\nThe second big driver of gross margins is the ramp that Lip-Bu just talked about of Panther Lake. You know, obviously we're in the early stages of the maturity of Panther Lake, so the cost per wafer is going to be higher, and so that is going to drive some headwinds. Obviously, as Lip-Bu said, you know, yields improve, more importantly, volumes increase, that reduces the cost, and so that will transition to a tailwind ultimately, I think next year. You know, the big benefit for us is this significant ramp in Panther Lake. You know, given that we're bringing a fair amount of wafers back inside, that drives a lower cost, and we get the better cost structure of Panther Lake showing up with the higher volumes. That's clearly going to be beneficial to us in terms of, in terms of gross margin.\nYou know, that said, you know, a lot of this will be determined on mix, and we'll have to see how things play out through next year. In terms of the mix, the last thing I'd say, and maybe this, maybe even a little bit more longer term than you asked. The question, Ross, is, you know, the way we think about foundry, we, you know, as we ramp more leading edge nodes, that is going to be a benefit to us in terms of gross margins. We think foundry gross margins will expand next year, and that will be a continuing story out for several years. The other side of things is the product side, and I think there are three levers to products. One is pricing, and as Lip-Bu said, he's really focused on bringing out products that customers really value.\nAs that becomes a reality, it'll show up in the pricing that will help out, help us on gross margins. The second is the cost structure. Lip-Bu is also really focusing on cleaner designs, simpler designs, driving more efficient use of silicon, and so forth. You know, as we get better cost structure as well over time, and there are products on the roadmap that already have it, even as PoR will see improvement in gross margins. In the near term, while all this is going on, I'm looking at all the other extraneous things that drive cost of sales. You know, how many samples we do, you know, how we run the fabs, and so forth, and driving improvements there to position us for better gross margins.\nRoss, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please? Certainly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot.\nLipu.\nI wanted to ask about the foundry strategy. You did add a bunch of risk factors and language on 14A that kind of seems to leave the door open to kind of walking away from its development.\nI know you did talk about.\nSome of that, if I'm an outside customer and I'm looking at your.\nRoadmap.\nI see this hedging on.\n14A, why would I engage? I guess, how do you sort of marry the hedging on 14A development with trying to build an external foundry business? I guess I kind of read it as maybe a hard pivot away from foundry and doing what's right for the product business, but can you sort of talk about that?\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, very good question. I think on the 14A, first of all, the team is laser focused on building up the basic building blocks, technology definition, transistor architecture, process flow, design enablement, PDK, foundation IP, and the test chip to verify and improve the performance and the defect density. Saying that, clearly we learned quite a lot on the mistake we make on the 18A, and now we apply into the 14A, so I think we learn a lot. Secondly, we also reach out to the outside.\nPartners helping us with show them the data and how can we improve the yield and per month, so that we can drive that, give me a lot of confidence we can get there. Even more important, we're engaging with customers that going to enable us, and then with clear milestone to execute in terms of process development and with PDK, with all the different IP that we need to really put it together. I think that gives me a lot more confidence that this time we have customers engaging early enough in the inceptions, and also we learn from our mistake and we can learn quicker and then get a better result. All in all, I think I give a lot more confidence.\nThe team is laser focused, and the feedback from the partners and outside is that, wow, the culture is changing, and you guys are really focused on the yield rather than just performance. I think that part will be able to enable us. Plus, the other part is we really engage with all the external EDA and IP provider, make sure that we have the whole program together to do the pattern matching for the customer. The good news is customer are excited. The 14A is a process node, but clearly I will make sure that until I see the internal customer, external customer, volume commitment before I put CapEx into the operation. That is something that you have to meet my requirement in terms of performance and yield.\nIt's a lot of responsibility to be serving our customer, make sure that we can deliver the result, consistent, reliable result to them, so that their revenue can depend on us.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a quick follow up question?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, yeah. I guess I just kind of wonder how an external customer would continue to be engaged. The question really is for Dave. Dave, you talked about CapEx coming down next year. What is maintenance CapEx, like how much can you cut CapEx next year? Could you take like $5 billion out of gross CapEx next year?\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nIf you can give some sense on that.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks. Yeah, okay, good question. Let me unpack it a little bit. I would say why CapEx can come down next year is, you know, we bought a lot over the last few years, quite honestly, and you know, we have to digest that, and that enables us to deploy more capital than we have to spend, which I guess is a good thing at this point. That's what's driving the fundamental view that we should be down in CapEx. It's not really moving it to maintenance CapEx, I would say, you know, but to, you know, kind of ballpark a number, I'd say probably half our CapEx is main, you know, but our normalized CapEx, call it at this $18 billion level for this year, is probably what you consider sustaining or maintenance CapEx.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Semiconductors, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. You mentioned again the Intel 7 being in short supply through the end of the calendar year.\nCan you talk about, you know, what's driving that? Is there, are you going to be able to drive more volume to the Intel 4 products, and you know what.\nYou have to add wafer starts in Intel.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI'm just kind of curious, what's going on with that.\nYeah, I mean Raptor Lake is doing really well. I mean that's the biggest driver of it.\nThat's why.\nBack to my comments around Lunar Lake ramping next quarter. You know what we're really seeing a lot of strength in is Raptor Lake right now. I think, you know, the price points of Raptor Lake are, I think, where a lot of consumers and enterprises are buying PCs. And so that's what's kind of pulling it, pulling it in. But I do suspect that we'll see mixes change. You know, you mentioned Intel 4, Intel 3, you know, Meteor Lake, and of course we all are ramping, and we're in the process of ramping Granite Rapids, which will drive more volume of Intel 4, Intel 3. So we're already building out the capacity and wafer out in that area.\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nJody, have a follow-up question?\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Semiconductors, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I do. Coming back to the CapEx, I mean.\nYou still have the large amount of.\nConstruction in progress that hasn't yet been productively employed. Are you going to be able to get full value out of that? I know there was a CHIPS first strategy. Is it going to continue to persist.\nThat there's a large amount of that or will you start depreciating that at some point?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, there was a big chunk of it. That was Arizona actually. We actually flipped that at the beginning of this quarter. So that's obviously already ramping on 18A. So we actually saw it come in. I think it was north of $50 billion at the end of Q2. And I think we're at this point now down into the kind of mid- to high $30s. So we've made a significant move in the right direction. You know, construction in progress or assets under construction is a mix of equipment and buildings. So the other thing that we're doing is trying to use more of that. And so that will also bring the number down. So we should have a steady improvement in that number through the rest of this year.\nThe goal is to kind of drive it down further next year. That said, we are going, you know, we are going to want to continue to have optionality on fab white space. And that's, you know, while we are slowing down Ohio, we're not stopping Ohio. So we're going to continue to make investments, and there will be assets under construction or construction in progress on our balance sheet to make sure we have flexibility as the demand drivers change.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research LLC\n\nHey guys, thanks for the question. Wanted to ask about servers. I may have missed it, but what's the trend you're expecting into the third quarter, and what are your thoughts about share losses there and when perhaps those dissipate a bit into the following year?\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nOkay, so I'll take. We're not giving out the guidance by business unit. You know, we're roughly up a little bit. We'll have to see how things play out between servers and CPUs. You know, as far as share goes, you know, obviously, you know, we're not where we want to be in terms of a competitive portfolio. And that's what Lip-Bu is really focused on improving. That said, you know, Granite Rapids is a better part. Diamond Rapids, the next part will be a better part. So we think we, you know, continually improve our relative competitive position. But to really be where we want to be still takes some work. And so, you know, I think the great thing about it is we actually have held share relatively well despite, you know, our position in the market in terms of performance.\nI think it's a good testament to the x86 ecosystem and the strength of that and our particular capabilities in the x86 system in terms of the ecosystem that we provide to our customers.\nBen, do you have a follow up?\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research LLC\n\nYeah, I was wondering if Lip-Bu would mind expanding on his commentary around the AI strategy.\nObviously you're going to be updating that at some point, if you don't mind clarifying when that will be.\nBut what do you?\nAre you inferring that you have a GPU centric strategy or something else? And how should we be thinking about how you're going to attack that market? Thanks.\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, very good question. So I think we're going to unfold our AI strategy in the months to come, but let me just share with you. I think we're going to look at it from where are we going to target and focus, and you know, first of all is the inference side and also the agentic AI, and that is really taking off, and we want to provide that intersection on that. And then we're going to take a different approach. We're going to look at the whole system software to the silicon and then drive the performance, and agentic, it's very important is the accuracy and speed. So I think with all this AI compute going to be even more intensive, but the workload is a little bit different.\nSo we want to look at how we can intercept using our franchise of x86 and then with the accelerator and then somehow drive that whole become the compute platform of the future. And so those are the things that were in the drawing board. We are working on it, and then we will share with you when we are ready. And so far the engagement with customer they love what we are, and basically we have to put the team and we are delighted. We add on a few team members come on board, and also we're going to focus on adding more software talents. So in a way that we can really drive some of this opportunity and bigger player in this opportunity.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line. William Stein from Truist Securities, your question please.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat, thank you for taking my question.\nLip-Bu. I'd also like to lean into this AI topic a little bit because I think you might not have used the.\nWe're full stack, but that's certainly what it sounds like.\nSo when I think about the opportunity that Intel has, I guess I've.\nThink of it as: do you want to be sort of like Nvidia? But Nvidia already has a very established position. You have cloud service providers doing ASICs.\nAnd you have AMD trying to do the same thing.\nSo, it sounds almost like you're aiming to be the third or arguably the fourth supplier in a market where there's really only two successful, and so far Nvidia and some of its customers. And I wonder to what degree you have considered or still considering another approach like doing ASICs to establish a better.\nPosition in this market. I hope that question makes sense but.\nAny clarification and education you could provide us would help a lot, I think. Thank you.\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nVery good question. Thank you. And then, first of all, I think you are correct. What I described about the system software is a full stack solution we try to provide, and then clearly we are behind, and we had tried to find the area that we can really wade in and then drive a different solution and service, and I think meanwhile want to play into our strength in the x86 so that we can really play that whole orchestrating what is the workload and then how do we optimize that, and then the other part is also important. Look at some of the new architecture.\nAnd that's why I'm embracing some of the startups and some of the incubating ideas so that we can bring that in. Back to another question that you have is the ASIC. So we are also very open to working with the system companies providing the AI platform that it can be purpose-built and so that really drives their performance. So absolutely we're going to drive that opportunity.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nWill, do you have a follow up question?\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nYeah, I'd like to maybe just ask about the write-downs in the quarter?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nIt sounds like that was equipment, but I wonder if there was any inventory in that as well, and maybe any clarification on what you're writing down to the degree think it would help us. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, we did have inventory write-downs, but we weren't isolating that. That's just part of the normal cost of sales roll up the rate. This particular write-down that we're isolating mostly was around.\nRoughly around impairments of equipment, and then there was another couple hundred million dollars. That was a kind of an adjustment in terms of how we take some certain extraneous costs, originally through inventory, and now moving it more to a period cost, the equipment. It was kind of a bunch of different things, but I would say I'll give you one of the bigger ones. That was an example. We had some tools that we had bought; they were sitting in assets under construction bucket. We had tools in the line that were older tools, and we took the opportunity since we had an extra excess amount, so we took the newer tools, put them in line, took the older tools out. They had a higher net book value than the value we can get in the open marketplace if we sell them.\nSo we wrote them down to that value and.\nThey'll be held in assets held for sale. So it was things of that nature, like I said, mostly older tools that we just couldn't find a purpose for.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks. Well, Jonathan, can we have the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For the first one I wanted to.\nTouch on 18A and 14A. So you said 18A would be supplying.\nThe next three generations of Intel products. So I guess that's 2026, 2027, and 2028. So I guess that would suggest 14A if it comes out, would be 2029 at the earliest. I guess number one, is that timing correct and then you know, just within that given the plans, you know, at.\nleast the contingency plans to maybe not do 14A.\nI mean, I guess it suggested if 14A dies, does the foundry strategy die with it?\nCan you run a sustainable business?\nJust on internal volume with 18A and increasing outsource if 14A doesn't do what it needs to do?\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nStacy, good question. So first of all, I think the, as I mentioned earlier, 18A is important to us for the third generation of internal product. And then when we're ready then we can go outside with more confidence to get a customer to support us. And then on the 14A, you know, same as a 14 from TSMC, the timing is all in the 2028, 2029, so that's no different, no change. And clearly we're laser focused on the process technology with the two engaging customer and with clear milestone to deliver. And then clearly I think we're going to learn a lot and then we're not going to put any CapEx until we see the yield performance and also our internal customer and external customer feedback and the volume commitment that we put the CapEx in.\nThe perception will be very clear, we are committed to the foundry business. Meanwhile, we're going to be very disciplined in our CapEx deployment, make sure that we see the volume, see the customer commitment, then we deploy.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nMaybe I'll just add one more thing if I understood the last question. Can you still do 18A?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI think is what you said, you know, we actually won't get to peak volumes on 18A until probably the beginning of the next decade. So this is going to be a node that we use for a very long time, and we're expecting a really good ROI on it. We largely are.\nLet's see, calculating that based on the internal uses for it, given that most of that is coming internally in the near term, I would say I wouldn't write off 18A as potentially getting external customers at some point. Clearly we probably won't get a lot in wave one as it seems, but there will be multiple waves and 18A will find different use cases over time and there'll be more opportunities for us to attract external customers after we do so much improvement in terms of performance and yield on our own products. Stacy, do you have a quick follow up? I do, thanks. I want to ask about the CapEx. So you talked about sustaining CapEx at like 50% of the current level, which would be like $9 billion I guess.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nShould I be thinking about that as?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nA plausible scenario for next year? I mean, if I take the current run rate for this year, like the gross CapEx in the first half and $18 billion for the year, it suggests like a quarterly run rate of, I don't know, $3.6 billion be something like $14, $14 and a half billion for the year. Like I guess I'm trying to figure out like what's a plausible number for where you might land next year given what you see. Is $9 billion actually on the table or is it closer to $14 or what do you guys actually have in mind? Yeah, fair question, Stacy.\nI was given like a ballpark, you know, what would be just, you know, we weren't like moving forward with something, but clearly we're going to need our assets under construction will not be enough to support all our CapEx investments, even with maintenance CapEx next year. So, you know, we haven't quite figured out exactly yet what the plan will look like for next year. We don't lock in our CapEx until early in the year. So that would be, you know, call it sometime in the January time frame of 2026. That will lock in 2026 as CapEx, but I think it's meaningfully higher than $9 billion. But certainly we think it's going to be less than $18 billion.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes to the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question please.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks.\nFor my first question, I wanted to discuss competition in the server CPU market. I see in your 10-Q you mentioned.\nServer ASVs are down 8% from last year because of a competitive environment. I thought that, you know, rising cores.\nWould mean greater ASP, so just if you could address that. But then kind of more medium- to longer-term Lip-Bu.\nHow impactful is competition from Arm who?\nIs claiming to take over 1/2 the server market?\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah, good question. So, I think, let me just look at the server market. You know, clearly, you know, we still have about, you know, 55%.\nMarket share, and clearly we have some mistake we make on the high-end performing server area. And one thing is this called Simultaneous Multithreading, and I think used to be Intel strength, but somehow we overlook it. And then now we are double down make sure that we will have that performance gap we can narrow. And then, meanwhile, we also engaging with some of the big hyperscale and also high-end enterprise; we learn what are the workload they require, and we laser focus on getting the product roadmap clear and simplified and make it easier to work with us. And so I think we take all the steps; we listen to customer. One thing that I think we change, we listen to customer very closely, and then engaging with them early in the product development and design definition stage, and they love it.\nAnd so, I think we have a chance to regain back, and then with the new products so that we can really drive the success here.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nZach, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes, thank you.\nMaybe one for Dave on gross margins.\nSo, Dave, let's say if your sales grow mid single digit next year, hypothetically.\nWhat will gross margins do?\nWhen you look at all the puts.\nAnd takes around the mix of 18A.\nWhat you need to outsource, I.\nknow you're not giving specific outlook, but.\nLet's say your top line grows. Is there a simple formula to look at gross margins versus the 36% level?\nThat you're at right now? Thank you.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nObviously the devil's in the details on this, but I think a good rule of thumb is that we get somewhere in the 40% to 60% fall through next year. Hopefully closer to the higher end of that if, if things work out in our favor.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nJonathan, we have time for one last question please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly, Aaron. Our final question for today comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking a question. I want to go back to the server discussion as well. I know in the past you guys have talked about the progression of 18A and Clearwater Forest, which I can appreciate the lower volume skew. But you know, I'm curious as you think about stabilizing your market share and maybe being able to recapture share, do you think that that's, that's a function of Diamond Rapids? And if so, you know, can we at all think about the timing of Diamond Rapids as you know, 2026, second half of 2026. Any clarity on that would be helpful.\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I think a good question. I think clearly we are looking at review our roadmap and then you mentioned about Clearwater Forest then the Diamond Rapids and clearly I think the time frame and you know it's ± now six months and I think overall I think we are pretty much focused on that and the next generation will be called Coral Rapids and clearly we're going to be review the whole Coral Rapids and that will be under 28, 29 and we make sure that we have a robust products to come out. So I think it's going to be fine tune and.\nDiscuss with the customer, get the validation from the customer, and so far I think we are. We can also have a new leader and some changes I'm making, and then clearly I think we're going to drive that. Whole data center is a very important business for us. We're going to be become competitive again.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nAaron, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah I do.\nThanks John. So real quickly just Dave, I want to go back like the skip of the Arizona and the Ireland fabs just remind us again how we should be modeling that. I think in the past you talked about a $500 million headwind this year and then that going to like $1.3 to 1.5 billion next year and significantly higher in 2027. So any kind of updates, should we still think about that? Is that increasing just you know any color?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, those are roughly the right numbers to forecast. You know obviously as we get out into the 2027-2028 timeframe we're kind of hitting the normalized run rates of these skips so it'll be higher than the $1.2-$1.3. We'll update you as we progress.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you all for joining us today. I must say I have been pleased with the teams and the progress we have made transitioning to a financially disciplined foundry, resetting how we engage with our customer and our partners, and simplify our operations. I look forward to discuss our continued progress with you next quarter. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn William Pitzer\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window.\nI'm joined today by our CEO, Lip-Bu Tan; and our CFO, David Zinsner. Lip-Bu will open with comments on our first quarter results as well as some initial observations, priorities and actions that he is driving. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including second quarter guidance. We will then transition to answer your questions.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We -- it also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release and most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures including reconciliations were appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, let me turn things over to Lip-Bu.\n\nLip-Bu Tan\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, John, and let me add my welcome. I joined Intel 5 weeks ago. The reason I'm here is simple, I love our company, I saw the challenges we were facing and I could not sit on the sidelines, knowing I had the opportunity to turn things around and put us back on the path to gain market share and drive sustainable growth. .\nQ1 was a step in the right direction, driven by Dave and Michelle's leadership, we delivered revenue, gross margins, EPS above our guidance. I want to thank them both as well as our teams for the good execution, especially with the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Our goal now is to build on this progress, but it won't be easy. There are many areas we need to improve, and there's no quick fixes. We must remain laser-focused on execution.\nOne of my biggest learning so far is that we need to fundamentally transform our culture and the way in which we operate. Organizational complexity and bureaucracies have been suffocating the innovation and agility we need to win. It takes too long for decisions to get made. New ideas and people who generate them have not been given the room or resources to incubate and grow. The unnecessary silos have led to bad execution.\nI'm here to fix this. I'm taking swift actions to simplify the way we do business and drive transparency and accountability across the company. We will empower smaller teams to move faster and make better decisions, and we will significantly reduce the number of layers that get in their way.\nAs a first step, I have flattened the structure of my leadership team, all critical product, manufacturing and G&A functions, which were spread over 2 to 3 layers are now directly reporting to me. This will allow me to get closer to our product and engineering groups and work directly with them to close the gaps with competition more quickly.\nI will apply the same streamlining approach across the company with a focus on empowering our engineering talents to create great products and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. To accelerate this simplification, we are taking more costs out of the business. The lower our call calendar 2025 and Calendar 2026 OpEx targets. We now expect OpEx of $17 billion this year and $16 billion next year.\nIn addition, as we continue to identify ways to operate our manufacturing network more efficiently, I have directed our teams to find additional $2 billion of savings in our gross CapEx, taking our target for this year to $18 billion.\nWe will continue to take a closer look at our existing factory footprint to ensure that we are making the most efficient use of our in-store capacity before committing to any additional spending. I will continue to make the needed investment to reignite innovation, even as we reduce our overall expenses by minimizing projects and programs that have been taking attention away from our core client and server business.\nThey will include revitalizing our engineering call. I'm rebuilding our engineering talent pool with urgency by promoting strong leaders internally, bringing back critical lost talent and recruiting new people. In addition, we are mandating a 4 day per week return to office policy, effective Q3 2025.\nI know firsthand the power of teamwork and this action is necessary to reinstill a more collaborative working environment, improving efficiency and boost innovation. By eliminating inefficiencies and transforming how we do business, I strongly believe we can reduce our costs while securing our future.\nMany of you have asked about my longer-term strategic plan. It is appropriate question. It's little bit too soon for me to provide all the details, but let me share with you my priorities. First, the best products always win, and this is very important that we refocus our core franchise to start building best-in-class products again. We have a good foundation, our ecosystem in client and data center computing is valuable and durable and we still maintain a large market share in both.\nMy focus will be ensuring that our team built products that are highly competitive and meet the needs of our customers as we enter a new era of computing defined by AI agents and reasoning models. To achieve this, we are taking a holistic approach to redefine our portfolio to optimize our products for new and emerging AI workloads. We are making necessary adjustments to our product road map so that we are positioned to make the best-in-class products, while staying laser-focused on execution, and ensuring on-time delivery.\nHowever, I want to emphasize that this is not a quick fix here. These changes will take time. Our goal is to become the platform of choice for our customers. This requires us to radically evolve our design and engineering mindset and anticipate the needs of our customers well in advance. I have received direct feedback from many of our largest customers, who are also close personal friends. I'm taking this feedback to heart and using it to inform and change our approach to product and platform design.\nSecond, we need to refine our AI strategy with a focus on emerging areas of interest. My experience helping successfully fund and incubate many start-ups in this space provides unique insights that we will leverage in this front. Our goal will be to take our integrated system and platform view to develop full stack AI solutions that enable more accuracy, power efficiency and security for our enterprise customers. Our goal will be to enable the next wave of computing defined by reasoning models, Agentic AI and physical AI.\nThird, we need to build trust with foundry customers. We have a lot of important building blocks in place. including the ramp of Intel 18A in second half of 2025 to support the launch of our first Pentium Lake SKU by year-end with additional SKUs coming in the first half of 2026. However, I know from my years at Cadence Design that success in foundry business requires more than process technology, manufacturing capabilities alone. It is first and foremost, a customer service business built on foundational principle of trust. And we need to instill customer service mindset across our foundry business.\nSuccess in foundry relies on recognizing that each customer use different design tools, methodologies and styles. As a foundry, we need to ensure that our process technologies can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with a unique way of building their products. To do this, we are more rapidly embracing industry standard EDA tools and best design practices.\nHere again, there's no quick fix, but we will make the necessary changes to our road map to deliver on the commitments we make to our foundry customers. We must learn to delight our customers by building wafers that meet their required power, performance, area, cost, quality, yield, reliability and on time schedule. While we are currently focused on delivering Intel 18A, we are also working closely with customers to define the critical KPIs to ensure online delivery of Intel 14A.\nLastly, we need to strengthen our balance sheet. Our business is capital intensive and we have important investment to make at the time when our financial performance is not where it needs to be. This means we need to be prudent with capital. In addition to new targets of OpEx, CapEx, we will also look to further monetize noncore assets. I'm very pleased to have Silver Lake as an investor in Altera and welcome on board Raghib to help drive the business to its potential.\nIn addition, we have made the decision not to spin off Intel Capital, but to work with the team to monetize our existing portfolio while being more selective on new investments that support the strategy. We need to get our balance sheet healthy and start the process of deleveraging this year. As we are building the new Intel, you can expect us to stay humble, drive the necessary changes to delight our customers.\nMy moto has always been to under-promise and over-deliver. And I will be not satisfied until we regain the trust of our customers, putting the company on a sustainable path of gaining shares and growing revenue and deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zinsner\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lip-Bu. Our Q1 results mostly reflected our view entering the year that our 2 biggest markets were poised for growth. On the client side, the end of service for Windows 10, the expected growing adoption of AI PCs and an aging installed base following the COVID era refresh pointed to a PC TAM growing 3% to 5%.\nWe -- Similarly, on the traditional server side, delayed infrastructure upgrades driven by the rapid adoption of AI servers in 2024, supported double-digit CPU core growth this year on a roughly flat units. More recently, the economic landscape has become increasingly uncertain driven by shifting trade policies, persistent inflation and increased regulatory risk.\nWhile we have yet to see a meaningful change in customer buying patterns, we think it's prudent to manage the business with a level of conservatism going into the second half of the year.\nFirst quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, coming in at the high end of our guidance range, driven by better-than-expected Xeon sales. Similar to Q4 2024, we believe Q1 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior in anticipation of potential tariffs, though it is difficult to quantify the magnitude.\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 39.2%, approximately 3 percentage points above our guidance on much stronger-than-expected demand for Raptor Lake, combined with improved cost for Meteor Lake. While we continue to see the mix of AI PCs growing throughout the year, the rate of growth off a lower-than-expected Q1 will be lower.\nWe delivered first quarter earnings per share of $0.13 versus our guidance of breakeven EPS driven by higher revenue, stronger gross margin and lower operating expenses. I was particularly pleased to see our spending down $400 million sequentially and $700 million year-over-year as we continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure.\nQ1 operating cash flow was $800 million. We had gross CapEx of $6.2 billion with offsets of $1.7 billion in the quarter resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $3.7 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $21 billion and received $1.1 billion from CHIPS grants and $1.9 billion for the final close of our NAND business sale to SK Hynix.\nMoving to segment results for Q1. As previewed on our Q4 '24 earnings, we updated our segment reporting for Q1 2025. Details can be found in the appendix to our earnings deck and in our Q1 25 10-Q. The following commentary reflects the updated segmentation and accompanying recasted 2024 financials.\nIntel products revenue was $11.8 billion, down 10% sequentially, but above our expectations. CCG revenue was down 13% quarter-over-quarter, below typical seasonality and in line with our expectation with higher-than-expected volumes offset by product mix and competitive pressure. DCAI revenue was down 5% sequentially and above expectations driven by hyperscaler demand for host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute.\nOperating profit for Intel Products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue and down $632 million quarter-over-quarter on lower revenue, partially offset by reduced operating expenses.\nIntel Foundry, delivered revenue of $4.7 billion, up 8% sequentially on pull-ins of Intel 7 wafers and increased advanced packaging services. Intel foundry operating loss in Q1 was $2.3 billion, roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and in line with expectations. Structural cost improvements were offset by start-up costs associated with the ramp of products on Intel 18A.\nTurning to All Other. Revenue came in at $943 million and was down 15% sequentially, slightly above expectations. The 3 primary components of All Other are Mobileye, Altera and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $103 million of operating profit.\nAs Lip-Bu stated, we announced on April 14, our intention to sell 51% of Altera to Silver Lake Partners for an almost $9 billion valuation with Intel receiving net cash proceeds of $4.4 billion. We believe the value of our remaining 49% stake in Altera will grow over time through our partnership with Silver Lake and with the addition of Raghib Hussain as the CEO. We expect this deal to close in the second half of 2025, at which point we expect to deconsolidate Altera from our financial results.\nNow turning to guidance. Historically, average sequential growth in Q2 has been roughly flat with Q1. However, the very fluid trade policies in the U.S. and beyond as well as regulatory risks have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing. This makes it more difficult to forecast how we will perform for the quarter and for the year even as the underlying fundamentals supporting growth I discussed earlier, remain intact.\nWhile we have offsets, including a global, highly diversified manufacturing footprint to help mitigate tariffs, we will certainly see cost increase, and we feel it prudent to anticipate a TAM contraction. The biggest risk we see is the impact of a potential pullback in investment in spending as businesses and consumers react to higher costs and the uncertain economic backdrop.\nAs a result, we're forecasting a wider-than-normal Q2 revenue range of $11.2 billion to $12.4 billion, down 2% to 12% sequentially. The -- within Intel products, we expect DCAI to decline at a faster rate than CCG. We expect Intel Foundry revenue down quarter-over-quarter due to pull-ins to Q1, lower wafer and advanced packaging volume and capacity constraints in Intel 7, which we expect to persist for the foreseeable future. For All Other, we expect revenue for the sum of those parts to be roughly flat sequentially.\nAt the midpoint of $11.8 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 36.5% on lower revenue and mix to our outsourced and lower-margin client products with a tax rate of 12% and breakeven EPS, all on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs you think about the full year, we recommend you start by using the last 10-year seasonality to model sequential changes in revenue, but be mindful of the significant uncertainty in markets today, especially due to the potential for meaningful tariffs and tight supply on our older nodes. We expect noncontrolled income or NCI and -- to net to 0 in Q2 and for the full year to be approximately $500 million on a GAAP basis. NCI is still expected to grow in fiscal year 2026 and to an updated range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion on a GAAP basis and meaningfully increase further in future years.\nAs Lip-Bu discussed earlier, we're simplifying our organizational structure and the way we work across Intel so that we innovate faster and adapt more quickly where needed to better serve our customers. As a result, we now expect 2025 OpEx of $17 billion, $500 million lower than prior expectations with a 2026 OpEx target of $16 billion.\nWe are likely to have restructuring charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance.\nThese spending reductions will be driven by numerous broad-based transformation activities. Key 2025 focus areas will be refocusing our portfolio, eliminating organizational complexity, transforming our engineering functions and continuing to drive to leading SG&A efficiency.\nAs Lip-Bu stated, we anticipate our 2025 gross capital investment will now be approximately $18 billion, which is below our previous guide of $20 billion, reflecting further operational efficiencies and better utilization of our construction in progress. While gross CapEx is down, we maintain our range for 2025 net CapEx to be approximately $8 billion to $11 billion due to uncertainty regarding timing of the U.S. government fulfilling their obligations in our CHIPS agreement.\nBeginning the process of delevering our balance sheet in 2025 remains a top priority for us as evidenced by our lower OpEx and CapEx targets and the value unlock across our noncore assets.\nI'll wrap up by saying that Q1 was a solid quarter to start even as the rest of the year is more uncertain. We will closely manage what's in our control and react quickly as the environment evolves. I'm encouraged by Lip-Bu's leadership and focus on enhancing our competitive position, improving our balance sheet and setting us on a path to deliver consistent returns to our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to John to begin the Q&A.\n\nJohn William Pitzer\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. Michelle Johnson Holthaus, CEO of Intel products will be joining Lip-Bu and Dave during the Q&A session. As a reminder, we would ask that each of you ask 1 question and a brief follow-up question where applicable.\nWith that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?",

As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. And good afternoon to everyone joining us today.\nBy now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our interim co-CEOs, Michelle Johnston Holthaus and Dave Zinsner. As you know, Michelle is also CEO Intel Products, and Dave continues to serve as Intel CFO. In a few moments, Michelle will open up with some summary comments before providing more detail Intel Products. dave will then discuss Intel Foundry and the overall financials, including our Q1 guidance. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\nIt also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Michelle.\n\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John. Let me add my welcome. It's been roughly two months since Dave and I stepped into our roles as interim co-CEOs. From day one, we have been working closely together alongside the board to drive better execution of our strategy. There are no quick fixes, and we are committed to improving our performance and rebuilding our credibility through persistent hard work that delivers tangible results. As part of this, we are driving more focused investments across the business. We cannot be all things to all people, and we are prioritizing areas where we can drive differentiated value. We are also continuing to simplify our business and become a leaner, more efficient company. And most of all, we are doing a better job of listening to our customers to ensure we meet their needs. Q4 was a step in the right direction.\nWe delivered revenue, gross margin, and EPS above our Intel Products executed to drive revenue in the quarter, even as PC inventory continued to normalize, and Intel Foundry drove incremental operating efficiencies while achieving key grant-related milestones, which supported solid upside to gross margins. As co-CEOs, you can expect us to be very straightforward and direct. We only make commitments we are confident we can deliver. We firmly believe that what we say is not nearly as important as what we do, and everything we do must be in service of our customers. Innovating to solve their most pressing challenges is the surest path to creating shareholder value.\nThis is the mindset I have brought to my position as the CEO Intel Products. this is a great business with great people, partners, and IP to design world-class products from edge to cloud. I take nothing for granted, but I firmly believe core x86 architecture and the ecosystems we have built and invested in over the decades create a solid foundation for success. Our customers share this view, but they need us to improve our execution and hit our commitments. I am setting clear priorities and directions in each business to drive better outcomes. I think Intel Products in three buckets. First Client Traditional Data Center, and third the AI Data Center. Let me spend a few moments on each. In client, Intel CPUs power roughly 7 out of every 10 PCs.\nThis is a strong position that gives us advantages in the market. That said, the market is becoming more competitive, especially as we see new entrants trying to participate in the AI PC category. Personally, I thrive on competition. It drives a healthy paranoia across everything we do, and we're using it as motivation to up our game even more. The success of Core Ultra across Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake has established Intel as the market leader in AI PC CPUs, and we remain on track to ship more than 100 million cumulative systems by the end of 2025. We are innovating at scale unlike any of our competitors. This was on display earlier this month at CES, where we launched the enterprise versions of our AI CPUs with compelling new features to Intel vPro.\nThis is a testament to the strong ecosystem we have built manageability, security, trust, and brand, and we expect these investments to position us well as corporations begin their migration to Windows 11. Alongside our investments in enterprise, our ecosystem reach also positions us well in the AI PC consumer markets. We are working with more than 200 ISVs across more than 400 features to optimize their software on our silicon. I'm excited about the new applications I'm seeing in the pipeline that will begin to proliferate over the coming months. Our goal is to innovate, partner, and fortify our position as the preferred CPU of choice. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we will strengthen our client roadmap with the launch of Panther Lake, our lead product on Intel 18A in the second half of 2025.\nAs the first volume customer of Intel 18A, I see the progress that Intel Foundry is making on performance and yields, and I look forward to being in production in the second half as we demonstrate the benefits of our world class design and process technology capabilities. 2026 is even more exciting from a client perspective as Panther Lake achieves meaningful volumes and we introduce our next generation client family code-named Nova Lake. Both will provide strong performance across the entire PC stack with significantly better costs and margins for us, enhancing our competitive position and reinforcing our value proposition to our partners and customers. Let me now turn Traditional Data Center business. the team has made good progress towards strengthening our offerings and driving better, more predictable execution.\nThis year is all about improving Xeon’s competitive position as we fight harder to close the gap to competition. The ramp of Granite Rapids has been a good first step. We are also making good progress on Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product that we plan to launch in the first half of next year. All of this provides a strong foundation on which to build as we execute. The world’s data center workloads still primarily run on Intel silicon, and we have a strong ecosystem, especially within enterprise. We are going to leverage these strengths as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025. One of the ways we’ll do this is by re-engaging the x86 ecosystem.\nWe have x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group we formed last fall, and we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for building both semi-custom and custom products. This is a big area of opportunity for the business, and we look forward to talking more about this as we have news to share. Turning to the AI data center, I will start by saying that this is an attractive market for us over time, but I am not happy with where we are today. On the one hand, we have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers, and we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU-based inference on-prem and at the edge as AI-infused applications proliferate. On the other hand, we're not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way.\nWe have learned a lot as we have ramped Gaudi and we are applying those learnings going forward. One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our roadmap and concentrate our resources. Many of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month. Based on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center more broadly. As I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably the need to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute. AI is not a market in the traditional sense.\nIt's an enabling application that needs to span across the compute continuum from data center to the edge. As such, a one size fits all approach will not work, and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the continuum. Before I turn the call over to Dave, let me close by speaking as Intel Foundry's largest wafer customer. I have a pretty simple approach. When we are able to combine world class products with world class process technology, we win. As CEO Intel Products, i will always make process technology decisions based on what is best for my customers. An Intel Foundry will need to earn my business every day, just as I need to earn the business of my customers.\nHaving said that, I'm confident in Intel Foundry's team's ability to support my current and future product roadmap, and I'm excited to do more business with them as their Intel Products combined with a more competitive intel foundry is a recipe for success for Intel overall. Dave, over to you.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Michelle. Let me add my welcome. I'm going to address three topics today: update on Intel Foundry, second, Q4 and full-year financials, and third, our Q1 guidance. Starting with Intel Foundry, I've had an opportunity to meet with a number of our partners and potential customers for Intel Foundry over the last couple months. I come away from those meetings encouraged by the opportunity we have in front of us, and I've received clear feedback on what our customers need from us to succeed. This starts with our execution on Intel 18A. This has been an area of good progress. Like any new process, there have been puts and takes along the way, but overall we're confident that we are delivering a competitive process.\nWe're excited by the launch of Panther Lake this year and the internal ramp of Intel 18A in the second half that will support increased volumes and improved profitability in 2026.\nFrom the perspective of external customers, Intel 18A is a very competitive offering that gives each of them a reason to engage with us. However, Foundry wins are about more than just technology. Trust is also a significant factor. Customers must believe you can execute consistently and be willing to invest in IP to port a design to a new foundry. That's why past transitions in the industry have generally started with customers giving new foundry partners smaller volumes, then gradually increasing as trust grows. We've made good progress, but to accelerate this I'm asking the team to redouble their efforts on ease of porting, IP availability, and best known foundry methods. I'm particularly pleased by the willingness of our suppliers and partners to engage with us, augmenting our expertise and hard work with theirs. Job number one is earning the customer's trust.\nThe Intel 18A design wins to date provide good validation of the strategy, and we continue to have a healthy RFQ pipeline of potential customers. But we won't win every deal out of the gates. We'll be selective and focus on areas where we are confident that we can be a meaningful contributor to the success of our customer, and we look forward to updating you as RFQs become wins. In addition, we continue to have good momentum in advanced packaging and in our collaboration with Tower Semiconductor and UMC. All three are critical to utilize our assets longer for higher rates of return. This is a good segue into my other key areas of focus for Intel Foundry. Improving our financials and making sure that we're deploying your capital appropriately. At roughly $18 billion in revenue, Intel Foundry today is larger than all but one external foundry.\nThat's clearly not reflected on our P&L. With negative gross margins and a greater than $13 billion operating loss in 2024, we're going to systematically attack our costs and remain highly focused on our goal of delivering break even operating income for Intel Foundry by the end of 2027, and we expect to demonstrate improvements this year. The financial benefits of shifting our wafer volume from Intel 7 to Intel 18A, along with learning to run our fabs more efficiently and our process nodes longer, will be important drivers of improving our financials beyond 2027. We need to drive to cash flow from operations that supports our capital spending needs and ultimately generate a great return on your capital. I remain very optimistic on our opportunity at Intel Foundry.\nThe pervasive growth of AI is driving accelerating and unprecedented demand for silicon, and there continues to be an unmet need for greater choice and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry. Today.\nTSMC is a valued supplier Intel Products, an important partner to IMS, and they've established a very high standard for what it takes to be a world class foundry. But the market overall needs multiple players, and as we execute, Intel Foundry has a very important role to play globally and especially here in the US where we continue to invest in leading edge R&D and manufacturing capacity.\nWe're also pleased to sign with the US Department of Commerce a definitive agreement awarding us up to $7.86 billion in grants. As you know, these grants are milestone based and we have already received $1.1 billion in Q4 and have received an additional $1.1 billion in January of Q1. In addition, we continue to make good progress building Secure Enclave in partnership with the US Department of Defense. We look forward to continued engagement with the Trump Administration as we advance this work and support their efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership. Finally, as you will recall, we announced our intention to establish an independent subsidiary structure for Intel Foundry to provide clear governance and operational separation. This structure also enables us to seek additional funding options from both strategic and financial partners, which we are now actively beginning to explore.\nLet me now turn to our consolidated financial results and Q1 guidance.\nQ4 revenue $14.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of the range we provided in October as a result of solid growth in CCG equipment sales at IMS and the edge business of NEX. Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 42.1%, 260 basis points ahead of guidance on higher revenue, better costs, and the receipt of our first CHIPS grant offset partially by inventory reserves related to Gaudi. We delivered Q4 earnings per share of $0.13 versus our guidance of $0.12. Higher revenue, stronger gross margin, and improved operating leverage was offset by lower interest and other income, which includes an accrual related to our second SCIP agreement of roughly $750 million reflecting an adjustment in our planned capacity ramp in Ireland.\nIn Q2, we began the process of resizing our expense structure to support more modest long-term growth, including adjusting our capacity plans to more conservative levels, driving impairments in Q3 and this accrual in Q4. Q4 operating cash flow was positive $3.2 billion, down approximately $900 million sequentially due to the cash outlays associated with our Q3 restructuring charges. We had gross CapEx of $6.3 billion with offsets of $1.6 billion in the quarter, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we also received a portion of the CHIPS grants this quarter.\nFor the full year revenue was $53.1 billion, down 2.1% year-over-year. Modest year-over-year growth Intel Products was more than offset by lower revenue at Mobileye and Altera as well as the forecasted decline in foundry services due to the end of life on traditional packaging revenue. Full-year gross margin was 36% and down 760 basis points due to Q3 impairments, lower revenue, and inventory impacts.\nFull year EPS was minus $0.13 and down $1.18 on lower revenue, lower gross margin, and higher period charges. We generated $8.3 billion in cash from operations, made $24 billion of gross capital investments, and generated capital offsets of approximately $13.4 billion from SCIP partner contributions and government grants and incentives. As a result, adjusted free cash flow was minus $2.2 billion and we ended the year with $22.1 billion of cash and short term investments. Moving to Segment Intel Products revenue was $13 billion, up 7% sequentially. CCG revenue was up 9% quarter over quarter as the rate at which our customers digested inventory slowed meaningfully from Q3. While difficult to quantify, we suspect a portion of Q4 revenue upside was due to customers hedging against potential tariffs.\nDCAI revenue was up slightly sequentially, up a better than expected Q3 as demand for traditional servers remains stable. Revenue for NEX was up 7.5% sequentially and is now up more than 20% from Q2 lows as customers are returning to more normal buying patterns, especially in our edge business.\nOperating profit Intel Products with $3.6 billion, 28% of revenue, and up $300 million quarter over quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially on increased EUV wafer mix and higher equipment sales by IMS. EUV wafer revenue grew from 1% of total revenue in 2023 to greater than 5% in 2024. Intel Foundry operating loss in Q4 of $2.3 billion improved meaningfully sequentially as Q3 was impacted by $3.1 billion of impairments. Excluding impairments, operating loss would have been roughly flat quarter on quarter.\nTurning to All Other, Mobileye reported revenue of $490 million, up 1% sequentially, with operating profit of $103 million, and earlier today guided for full year 2025 increases to both revenue and operating income. Altera delivered revenue of $429 million, up 4% sequentially. Operating margin was 21% versus 2% in Q3. On better gross margins and operating leverage for Q1, we expect Altera revenue to be down sequentially less than overall Intel consolidated. We continue to make good progress on the stake sale of Altera and see a path for an IPO in the coming years. Now turning to guidance, Q1 has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter of the year, down high single- to low double-digit percentage sequentially on average. In addition, we see added pressure coming from macro uncertainty, especially around tariffs, balancing of PC inventory, and increasing competition.\nThese mitigating factors support a more tempered revenue outlook as we come into the new year. As a result, we're forecasting a revenue range of $11.7-$12.7 billion in Q1 2025, down between 11%-18% sequentially. Intel Products, we expect revenue to decline across all three of our segments at roughly similar rates. We expect Intel Foundry revenue roughly flat to down modestly quarter over quarter, helped by continued mix shift to EUV wafers, Intel 18A samples, and advanced packaging.\nAt the midpoint of $12.2 billion. We expect gross margin of approximately 36% with a tax rate of 12% and breakeven EPS all on a non-GAAP basis. Let me take a few moments to provide some commentary that may be helpful for your full year 2025 modeling. At the consolidated level, we expect gross margin to improve from Intel Products gross margin was 51% in 2024 and is expected to decline this year due to product mix in both CCG and DCAI. Intel Foundry gross margin will improve on EUV mix shift and growth in advanced packaging. Despite expected depreciation growth in 2025 of roughly 10%, we continue to target 2025 OpEx of $17.5 billion with further reductions in 2026.\nWe expect Non-Controlling Interest or NCI to net to roughly 0 in Q1 and be in the range of $500-$700 million impact this year on a GAAP basis. NCI is expected to grow in fiscal year 2026 to a range of $1.2-$1.4 billion on a GAAP basis and increase further in future years as we increase wafer outs at our fabs where we have agreements with SCIP Partners.\nWe anticipate that our 2025 gross capital investments will be approximately $20 billion at the low end of our previous guide of $20 to $23 billion, reflecting further capacity adjustments to Ohio and Ireland, as well as better utilization of what we call our construction in progress. Specifically, we invested ahead of demand over the past few years, and these capital investments will enable us to meet expected demand at a lower level of spending as we drive to more efficiently deploy our capital. We expect 2025 net CapEx of $8 to $11 billion, with roughly half of the offsets expected to come from government incentives and tax credits, and half from partner contributions. Delevering in 2025 remains a top priority for us on lower CapEx. Increased cash from operations and value unlocked across our non-core assets.\nFinally, I will remind you that we will provide new segment reporting in conjunction with our Q1 earnings. We expect to make further changes to our segments and, including moving the edge portion of NEX into CCG, and our auto business from All Other into CCG. In addition, we expect to move the networking portion of NEX, which includes Xeon sales, into DCAI, and the IMS equipment business out of Intel Foundry into All Other. I'll wrap up by saying that Q4 was a solid quarter to close out a challenging year. With that said, our profitability is below where it needs to be, and we must enhance our competitive position in the market. Michelle and I will continue taking actions to improve the operational and financial trajectory of the business. We'll remain focused on building a Intel Products business and becoming a more efficient Intel Foundry.\nAnd by driving continued progress in these areas, we're confident in our ability to unlock value for our stakeholders. Before we open the line to questions, it's worth mentioning that the Board remains intensely focused on the search for a permanent CEO. The search is progressing, but we have nothing new to report and won't be able to add additional information on this topic today. With that, I'll turn it over to John to start the Q and A.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one would be for MJ. You talked about no quick fixes but a lot of things to improve the roadmap. Specifically, on the DCAI side of things, can you talk about how much you think Granite is closing the gap? It sounds like Clearwater Forest is not mentioned nearly as much as far as a 2025 event, neither from a launch or from a revenue perspective.\nSo if there's any updates on that and then just overall what it's going to take and when do you think we will be able to externally see that gap close versus competitors?\n\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products, Intel Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Ross. I look at it this way, so when I talk about no quick fixes, I think it's going to be one to two years of consistent execution and continuing to see better products each year, really to bring our customers back to the table and be excited about Intel's roadmap. Granite Rapids is a good first step in doing that. It does close the gap. Our customers are excited about it, and we are starting to see the competitiveness of that product materialize in volume. But I'm also very clear-eyed about where we stand. And so we've just got to see that continued throughout 2026 when we get to Diamond Rapids, etc. So you also asked me about Clearwater Forest. So I really look at the data center market in kind of two buckets.\nWe have our P-core products, which you know is Granite Rapids, and then we have our E-core products, which equates to Clearwater Forest. What we've seen is that's more of a niche market, and we haven't seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected. But as we look at Clearwater Forest, we expect that to come to market in the first half of 2026. 18A is doing just fine on its performance and yield for Granite Rapids, but it does have some complicated packaging expectations that move it to 2026. But we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well. But this is going to be a journey, it's not a destination.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nYes. Switching over to Dave, on the profitability side, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes on the gross margin sequentially in Q1? Obviously revenues are down, but anything else. And then you mentioned that it would be the low point of the year, the gross margin in Q1. But what would be the headwinds and tailwinds as you think through 2025 as a whole on that metric? Thank you.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Ross. Okay, so for Q1, the biggest obvious contributor to gross margins sequentially is the revenue decline. You know, at the midpoint we're declining a little over $2 billion. And so that obviously, you know, on a mostly fixed cost business, that does affect it. We also did have a couple of bluebirds in Q4. One was the revenue beat, and so that actually elevated the revenue a bit. But the other was when we signed the CHIPS agreement.\nWe were able to take some of the grant and accrue it as, you know, kind of a benefit to cost of sales because it offset period expenses we had spent before. So.\nWe weren't sure we were going to sign it in the fourth quarter, which is why I didn't guide that in the guidance from last quarter. But obviously it materialized and that pushed the gross margins up for the fourth quarter.\nIn the first quarter, I think. We've kind of telegraphed this now for several Intel Products gross margins are going to be under pressure this year. Some of the parts have a higher cost. In particular, Lunar Lake has a higher cost, as you know, because it's got the memory and package. And so, you know, we're basically buying that memory and turning around and selling it at the same price. That's really weighing the margins down on Lunar Lake. Margins for products is going to be under pressure pretty much throughout this year. As Panther Lake comes, you know, in volume next year more materially and you know, in addition, the products beyond that, we'll start to see some improvement in margins Intel Products. now that was always to be offset in a lot of ways by the margins of Intel Foundry.\nYou know, we see more of a mix of EUV wafers. They have better pricing with a better cost. And so we'll see a mix improvement throughout the year. We're also reducing our spending there in OpEx as part of our, you know, kind of overall $10 billion plus cost spending reduction. But it doesn't really show up in the first quarter. It's not until we get into the second and third quarter that we start to see that improvement show up. So those are really the bigger drivers of margins on the first quarter. It is a low point. As we talked about, you know, the benefits are going to be really around, you know, margins improving on Intel Foundry as the mix of EUV wafers increases throughout the year.\nIn particular, as we get Panther Lake in there in the back half of the year and we're selling 18A wafers at a higher margin. And then next year we have Panther Lake made more volume and all those wafers start to come back and that becomes a really big benefit to Intel overall.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi guys, thanks for taking my question. First question, just on the segment guide for next quarter. Why are all three product segments down equally when it sounds like you've gotten more headwinds just on the server side of PCs inventory digestion and maybe the roll off of some of that tariff pull forward?\nWhat's going on in the data center and the NEX businesses that makes them as bad as Client in the Q1?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nWell, broadly across all markets, and you know, we didn't necessarily telegraph every market in terms of where we think, but I'd say broadly, you know, we're a little bit cautious on the macro, and that affects all markets. In addition, seasonality does play in most of the markets, and that does impact Q1 as well. So I would say combination of just macro uncertainty combined with kind of typical seasonality across all the businesses. Stacy, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nYeah, I do, thank you.\nSo you also talked about increased competitiveness weighing on margins at least in the Q1. So again I presume that's a question on pricing, I guess, is that right? Do you expect that to persist through the year, and how do you think about that competitiveness potentially weighing on pricing across client and especially in the data center?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Okay, so the co-CEO is trying to figure out who should answer that. Okay, go ahead, Michelle, whoever wants to take it.\n\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products, Intel Corporation\n\nThe way I look at that is we do have increased competition as we see new market entrants particularly come in to CCG. We've got a very good product in Lunar Lake there. But as Dave talked about, you know, the margins on that product are more pressured based on the cost of the product. But we are going to stem the market segment share decline in client and we're going to go after winning every socket that mirrors itself. When you think about the data center market as well. As I said, Granite Rapids is a very positive step in a competitive direction. But we have to stem the tide of share loss in data center and so we will be fighting for every socket in that business.\nThe way I look at it is we need to be aggressive, we need to win share, and we need to show our customers that they can win with us.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon.\nThank you for taking the question. I guess first question under your new co-leadership would be curious to hear how your strategy has potentially evolved, specifically for IFS.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI mean, I think, and we've talked about this over the last couple quarters. For one, we are not looking to spend ahead of success. And so, you know, you saw our CapEx guide come down from the 20 to 23 range, down to 20. That's in, you know, in support of that strategy. You know, we want to absolutely wow the customers, but to do that we've got to be very careful around what we're promising them as well. So I think what you'll see a lot of is a little bit more conservatism around how we deploy capital, how we engage with customers. We want to be doing more than what we promise to every turn, to every stakeholder, including investors, including customers, including suppliers, so what have you.\nThat's pretty much the strategy, the main goal of building a world-class foundry that's still in place. You know, we feel that there absolutely is a need for another player in the leading edge semiconductor manufacturing space, in particular in the US. It aligns with the government, the US government's interests as well. So we're absolutely committed to that. It's now about being very cautious and careful around generating the best ROIC for the shareholders. CJ, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nI do. Thanks, I guess. Dave, another question for you. I believe that three months ago the stated goal for 2025 was to be free cash flow positive. I guess given kind of the weakness we're seeing in Q1 and uncertainty. Can you kind of walk through how you're thinking about the path to turning free cash flow positive?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, so we're not obviously guiding, you know, beyond the first quarter, but I would just say we, you know, we did a very good job in a challenging situation in 2024 around cash flow from operations by driving strong working capital improvements. And we adjusted CapEx accordingly, and that helped, you know, stem the tide. So while we were negative in 2024, you know, we were closer to zero than we should have been. Based on the top line results, I'd say it's more about the same in 2025. We're going to be acutely focused on cash flow from operations, really managing working capital effectively. We adjusted the CapEx down as I talked about, in relationship to a different outlook. We do expect some pretty significant.\nOffsets as well. More than $10 billion of offsets, which will also help. I won't throw out a number yet for, for adjusted free cash flow for the year, but I would just say that it's a focus that we, that we're where we want to improve. I would say in addition to that we have these non-core businesses and we see opportunity to monetize there. That will help us delever because that's a focus of us focus of ours in 2025. We are, you know, far along on the process of Altera. I suspect that by the time we get to earnings next, next quarter we'll have something to say there that will help generate some cash that we can use to delever.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, C.J. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Semiconductors, Morgan Stanley\n\nYour question please. Great, thank you. In the prepared remarks you made reference to the sort of tempering of expectations of Falcon Shores. Can you talk about, you know, what was behind that and kind of what does it take for you to get competitive in that space?\n\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, of course I can, Joe. I think it really comes down to taking the time over the last six weeks to actively engage with the teams. Look at our roadmaps, look at where we are from a competitive perspective and from an execution perspective. And that really resulted in that decision. A lot of conversations with my customers as well in regards to what do they see is needed to be competitive and to deliver the right product. And so when I looked at that, obviously we have our Gaudi product, we're learning a lot from that. But one of the things that we've learned from Gaudi is it's not enough to just deliver the silicon. We need to be able to deliver a complete rack-scale solution. And that's what we're going to be able to do with Falcon, excuse me, with Jaguar Shores.\nFalcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system, networking, memory, all the component functions of that. But what customers really want is that full-scale rack-scale solution. So we're able to get to that with Jaguar Shores. I think we've also seen a lot this week with DeepSeek and a lot of the excitement around not one size fits all. So I'm also trying to look at the roadmap to say there's a lot of IP and assets Intel Product Co that we can leverage to address this market. We've got great CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, FPGAs, and we need to figure out how we harness those because if we've seen anything this week, when there are constraints put on customers, they figure out different ways to deploy technology.\nThat's also a great opportunity and something that I'm looking at if there's ways that we can be disruptive there.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Semiconductors, Morgan Stanley\n\nI do, and thank you for your candor about all of that. I think separately you mentioned in the prepared remarks about potentially seeing tariffs driving some pull forward. Can you just talk about, you know, how pervasive that might be? Is that conservatism that might be happening? Are you seeing evidence that that's happening? Just some color on where that's coming from?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I mean we, you know, we obviously have a fairly good sense of, you know, what customers, you know, need from quarter to quarter. And in a couple of instances, customers ordered more than we think they were digesting. And so, you know, it was really just the analytics that gave us insight into that they're doing that for a reason. And we know tariffs are a big.\nSubject of a lot of our customers. It was in the region you might expect, in the Asian region, that we saw this.\nIt's hard for me to extrapolate this beyond this quarter. A lot's not known yet around what might be the plans on tariffs. I just thought it was a little bit of hedging going on by customers that, you know, pulled revenue into the fourth quarter and away from the first quarter.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes in line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I also wanted to ask about gross margin. I think the message you were saying is that it's kind of 60% incremental and that was kind of off of the 39.5 that you guided for, you know, Q4. But obviously you came in, you had these one-timers and now we're down in March.\nSo can you just sort of like level set us for kind of how to think of the incrementals from here?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nIncrementals from Q1, in other words, into Q2, Q3, and Q4. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, just. Yeah, just kind of like is it off at 39? Is it off at 36? Yeah, yeah. The rule of thumb has generally been 60% in this period of what I call catch up. Obviously we think we can do better fall through as we get more stabilized. The one dynamic in 2025 is this kind of margin pressure around product like Lunar Lake. That probably pulls the range down to probably something more like in the 40%-60% fall through is probably the right way to think about it just for that dynamic. Now we get into 2026 and you start to see a lot more 18A volume through Panther Lake. I think we're in the 60% plus range at that level.\nTim, do you have a follow-on question?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, yeah. Dave, also, so you took the CapEx to the low end, but there's a billion-dollar outflow that's in the financing section of the cash flow statement. What is that? I guess I'm trying to figure out just on an apples-to-apples basis, is like CapEx really coming down this year, and is that a line item in the financing section? Is that going to keep getting bigger this year? Thanks.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nLet's see. Let me go back in the CapEx.\nIf you look at CapEx for 2025, the $20 billion forecast, what's driving that lower is really a function of.\nBetter utilizing assets under construction. So our philosophy had been to invest kind of ahead of what was required, and we built up a pretty significant balance in assets under construction, I mean to the tune of greater than $50 billion. So we actually have a lot of capital on the balance sheet that really hasn't been deployed. And so what we push the teams to do, in an effort to drive better ROA and return on invested capital, is to have them digest as much as possible and limit the amount of purchases.\nThat we make externally. That's going to allow us to get down to the $20 billion range. I would be, we're not doing any funky financing around this, but I would.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nWell, you know, in the spirit of transparency say that, you know, CapEx is two things, right? It's what you place in terms of orders on equipment and it's when you give them the cash. And so for sure we are working the payment terms of suppliers to improve our, you know, to improve our CapEx lower, our CapEx that, that is pushing, you know, spend out even as we're getting the assets in. But quite honestly by the time we've actually deployed it and it's depreciating, we've actually in all cases I think spent the money because it goes on to assets under construction and probably hangs in there for like nine months before it's ever deployed.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question please.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question first.\nKind of related questions are on the data center, server on CPU market? And I'm curious, when you look at Intel versus your x86 competitor, do you think their share gains are because of better design or access to better manufacturing? And so what can be fixed and what will take time to fix? If you were to outsource more right to external foundry, does that help you regain share? And I imagine that applies more to cloud and then on the enterprise side, have you seen any share shifts at all over the last few years?\n\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Vivek.\nWell, if you look at data center and the competitiveness, as I said or stated earlier, you know, Granite Rapids did a good job of making a good first step in closing the gap versus competition. But we still have a gap, and so we've got to be laser focused next on delivering Diamond Rapids. And the feedback for both of those products early is very positive when it comes to external manufacturing. I've been pretty transparent about this in the way I think about it in my philosophy, and you know, the way I look at it is you have to have the right product, the right process, and you have to deliver that within the right market window. If you look at Intel overall today, we do about 30% of our manufacturing externally across a variety of partners.\nThat's probably the high for where we are today, but it will never be 0%. What I can tell you is 18A is going well. They earned my business obviously, both for Panther Lake and for Clearwater Forest. But as I think about being more competitive in data center moving forward and I look at future designs, I will ask myself that question every time as we look at the roadmap. So I think it would not be unfathomable that I would put a data center product outside if that meant that I hit the right product, the right market window, as well as the right performance for my customers.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nVivek, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes, thank you, John. So maybe one for Dave on this non-controlling interest. I think Dave, you said $500-$700 million for this year. So a little bit lower than I think the $700 million you had before. But then it starts to grow to $1.2 or $1.4 billion. Is this always going to keep on increasing? What is the right way for us to model it? Because the less you outsource, I guess the more you insource, the more you give to Intel Foundry, the more reversals, right, you have to do on this NCI part? I would imagine so. Is there a reasonable way to model how much of a headwind this is to your reported EPS?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, it's a good question. I mean just to break it all out, it's more than just the SCIPs.\nSCIP 1 and 2 are obviously in there. But also Mobileye shows up in non-controlling interest, and as we sell down stakes in companies like Mobileye and Altera, it actually exacerbates that NCI. So Altera, it doesn't have any NCI, but as soon as we sell a stake, it is going to have NCI. So there are a number of things that go into it, which makes it a little bit difficult to forecast because you have to kind of know what you have to know two things with certainty. One, exactly what share of every asset you have, and two, what your production is going to look like in the fabs that you have had these SCIPs. So what we felt comfortable was with guiding, guiding 25 and giving you an indication for 26. It's likely to go up in 27.\nBut I think it's probably too soon to actually identify what the exact number will look like.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line. Ben Reitzes from Melius, your question please.\n\nBen Reitzis\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey guys, thanks a lot for the question.\nDave and MJ, I wanted to, you know, I know in your prepared remarks you said you look forward to working with the Trump administration. I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail about your initial talks with them. Have they reached out and who's like leading the discussions from your side and you know, any color on what you're exactly talking about and what they're particularly interested in. I mean Howard Lutnick, obviously he sounds like this is very near and dear to him during his confirmation hearings and would love to just kind of get a little bit more color on where you, what you have done so far and where you think it's going, and then I'll have a follow up. Thanks so much guys. Yeah, okay, thanks Ben. Maybe I'll take that as the co-CEO. How's that?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation",
    "content2": "We have good engagement with them. We've really been engaged since the election with the team at various levels, obviously at the CEO level. But also we have a strong government affairs team that engages with them every day. I feel really good about their outlook on bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. I think this is a very positive sign. Obviously for us. Quite honestly, we never left the US so we're in a kind of the pole position in that regard. And I think they understand the value of doing R&D in the US for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, which also is positive. You know, they want to see more jobs coming back to the US. We pay high-wage, high-tech jobs so that's obviously positive for them.\nBut more importantly, you know, this is about security, both in terms of just the supply chain, but also in, you know, kind of secure manufacturing for the Department of Defense, which, you know, we're obviously in a position to do for them. You know, I imagine that, you know, as we progress, we'll be more engaged with them to make this a reality. And both Michelle and I will be meeting fairly regularly with Trump administration officials to go make their goals a reality for the U.S. Ben, you said you had a follow up. Yeah, thanks. I want to double click on a prior question on gross margins and ask it a little bit more in caveman terms rather than incrementals. You talked about Q1 being the bottom.\nI'm trying to figure out how high it goes sequentially as we go throughout the year. Given sounds like you're going to be a lot more price aggressive in server CPUs and client CPUs from what I heard. So in addition to, I'm trying to balance that with the thought of outsourcing more to TSMC for the year, et cetera. So if that's the low point, I guess what I'm trying to say. Can you be more prescriptive in light of that pricing comment I made and if it's right, then just give us a little more color on where we go from the Q1.\n\nBen Reitzis\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nThat'd be great. Thanks.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, yeah, I mean, intend to be competitive in the product space. And also, you know, as I mentioned, the cost structure is, you know, under some pressure in particular because of Lunar Lake.\nSo that, that absolutely will impact the gross margins on products. There won't be a lot of lift in that business unit through the year. It's really not until Panther Lake comes that they, I think, start to see some better cost structure and, you know, have a, have a part that's very competitive that I think allows us to, you know, perhaps even relax some of that pressure in a competitive market. That said, the foundry business will see improvements, you know, over the course of the year. More wafers will be coming back with Panther Lake. It becomes even better in the following year. We are improving the cost structure of the foundry business as part of our overall spending reduction plan. So that will also help.\nAnd then just keep in mind, you know, these, these wafers that we're producing at Intel 3 and 18A have much better cost structure and margin structure relative, I should say, relative to the price structure than their predecessors. And that will be beneficial on the foundry side. So in the caveman macro sense, I think the best thing to do is probably take this like somewhere in the 40%-60% fall through and that's probably the right rough order math to get you to where the margins will go in any quarter based on what you're projecting the revenue to be in that quarter.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question.\nI want to build off of that last question a little bit. You know, during the prepared remarks, you had mentioned 1% in 2023 was EUV wafer mix, and that progressed to north of 5% this year. Can you give us a framework of how you would define success looking through 2025, maybe exiting the year, as far as EUV wafer mix, and remind us again what the, the delta is in terms of cost structure, the margin dynamics of an EUV wafer?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, well, I'll say on the second part, maybe I'll, I'll answer that one first. I would say the price on those wafers goes up at 3x the cost of those, of those wafers. Oh, sorry, maybe said it. The blended ASP and cost goes up 3.3x as you go to 18A versus the cost.\nSo it's a pretty dramatic improvement in gross margins as you move into 18A versus pre-EUV wafers.\nProbably be tough for me to hazard a guess on exactly how we'll exit the year in terms of our percentage of EUV. It's definitely going to go up. You know, Granite is on Intel 3, Panther Lake is on 18A, Meteor Lake is on Intel 3 or 4, call it the 3-4 node. Panther Lake is on 18A this year, so we'll see a pretty meaningful jump in the percentage of wafers that will be EUV as we exit 2025. Yep. Aaron, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nI do, and it's probably a dumb question, but I'm just going to ask it because I'm just a little confused that, you know, the SCIP impact, this $500-$700 million going to $1.2 billion. Just, just remind us again so we're all clear that when you report EPS.\nOn a non.\nGAAP basis, that's in that EPS number. Just so I'm modeling it correctly. I'm sure my peers are already, but I want to make sure I've got that all clear in my head.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI just want to make it clear it's not just SCIP. I mean that includes the Mobileye income and will include the Altera income to some extent. But yeah, all of that in the NCI we do take it against our non-GAAP number to get our fully diluted non-GAAP EPS number.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nAaron. Thank you. John, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you. Thanks for squeezing me in, Dave. On the foundry break-even, I guess target for 2027 maybe, can you talk about what are the assumptions behind that? I mean, do you think you can get there with, you know, mostly internal wafers or do you need external customers as well? If so, you know, what sort of revenue do we need from external customers to, I guess, achieve that break-even?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, so we're still aiming to get to break even in 2027. As you pointed out, it's really on the back of internal wafers or wafers Intel Products, i should say. And it's obviously a lot based on EUV wafers, which carry a better margin, and as that mix improves, that significantly improves the margins. But more importantly, I think the original premise by creating this different P&L structure was to drive the foundry business. Really at that point was just a function: manufacturing to be more focused on efficiency, to squeeze out more from the existing footprint, to be more sensitive to capital, and ultimately just think about ROIC and everything they do. And I think that has worked actually. I mean I hear it all the time.\nIt's amazing the transformation we've seen in staff meetings and Michelle and I that attend that, you know, how they completely pivoted to how to make money in that business. And so I think it's working. I think we'll see significantly more efficiency as we go into, you know, work through 2025 and into 2026. So I feel good about our ability to get to break even. Obviously we want to have external customers and so you know, we have some very small amount that we've assumed for 2027 but if 18A looks like it's, it's something that hunts based on feedback from customers and I feel like we will probably outperform in that regard in terms of the mix of external customers versus internal customers.\nSo you know, those are all the factors that I think will drive 27 to profitability. Ultimately obviously want to get to or push to a breakeven and ultimately want to get the business to a profitable level that's consistent with what the foundry industry gets. Srini, do you have a quick follow on?\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Raymond James\n\nYeah, quick one. So on the 18A Panther Lake, I think in the past, I think Dave, the comment was that you expect to bring roughly 70% of the die in house. Is that still the plan? And then is that pretty set in stone that you're bringing it back for sure, or do you have any flexibility whether to bring back more of the die or less of the die if you need to? So just trying to understand, you know.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I'm going to let Michelle answer that because it really is her decision on how she builds her product.\n\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. So we did move Panther Lake inside and it's an 18A design win. But as I stated before, you know, we look at each generation of product based on was the right product, what's the right process, what's the right market window, and what allows our customers to win. So for Panther Lake, that was 18A and as I said, we're very happy with where we are from a performance and yield perspective at this point in the process. So that will stay on 18A. Then as you look forward to, you know, our next generation product for client after that, Nova Lake, we'll actually have die both inside and outside for that process. So you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside.\nAgain, it's about optimizing to what allows us to win in the market, what allows us to win with our customers, and optimizing the overall product portfolio. Because at the end of the day, if our customers are successful, we win. That drives more wafers and Intel Foundry and that allows us to win. But I'll continue to have a balance and as I said, we'll be doing the same look across our data center portfolio as well.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nAll right, thanks, Michelle. So with that, let me wrap up by saying thank you as always for joining the call. MJ and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress and the actions we've taken. Q4 was a good step forward, obviously, but we have a lot of hard work ahead of us and we're looking forward to updating you as we go along. We hope to see many of you in person at the investors conferences we'll be attending in Q1. I'd also like to highlight that the Intel Foundry team will be hosting their second annual Direct Connect User event on 29 April in San Jose. We hope many of you will join that in person. So thank you and good night.\n\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nInterim Co-CEO and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nSA.\nSam.\nSa.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star 1 1 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 1 1 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q2 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.\nOur earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate, to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 profitability was disappointing despite continued progress on product and process roadmaps. With our new operating model firmly in place, we are accelerating actions to improve profitability and capital efficiency by more than $10 billion in 2025, which I will discuss shortly. For the quarter, we delivered sequential revenue growth in line with our forecast, despite the unexpected timing of new export control restrictions announced in May. Q2 profitability was below our expectations, due in part by our decision to more quickly ramp Core Ultra AI CPUs as well as other selective actions we took to better position ourselves for future quarters, which Dave will address fully in his comments. We previously signaled that our investments to define and drive the AI PC category would pressure margins in the near term. We believe the trade-offs are worth it.\nThe AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026. We know today's investments will accelerate and extend our leadership and drive significant benefits in the years to come. Our efforts will culminate with the introduction of Panther Lake in H2 2025. Panther Lake is our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a much more performant and cost competitive process which will additionally allow us to bring more of our tiles in house, meaningfully improving our overall profitability. Another important driver of improved financial performance is the cost reduction plan we announced today. This plan represents structural improvements enabled by our new operating model which we are pulling forward to adjust to current business trends. Having separate financial reporting for Intel products and Intel Foundry clarifies and focuses roles and responsibilities across the company.\nIt also enables us to eliminate complexity and maximize the impact of our resources. Taking a clean sheet view of the business is allowing us to take swift and broad-based actions beginning this quarter. As a result, we expect to drive a meaningful reduction in our spending and headcount beginning in the second half of this year. We are targeting a headcount reduction of greater than 15% by the end of 2025, with the majority of this action completed by the end of this year. We do not take this lightly, and we have carefully considered the impact this will have on the Intel family. These are hard but necessary decisions. Our actions will reduce OpEx to approximately $20 billion in 2024, and we see a bigger impact next year with 2025 OpEx targeted at $17.5 billion, more than 20% below prior estimates.\nWe expect further benefits in 2026 with OpEx to decline in absolute dollars yet again. Even as we lower overall spending, we will continue to fund the investments needed to deliver our strategy.\nOur new operating model is also driving benefits to our capital requirements, giving us the transparency to more rigorously scrutinize every project and every dollar of capital. As a result, we now expect gross CapEx in 2024 to be between $25 and 27 billion. That is a reduction of over 20% from our plan entering the year and additionally reflects expectations for softer second half demand. Combined with strong execution of our Smart Capital strategy including our second SCIP with Apollo, we expect net capital spending in 2024 will be between $11 and 13 billion. These benefits will carry forward to next year as well. For 2025, gross capital spending is targeted between $20 and 23 billion and net capital spending between $12 and 14 billion.\nIncreased capital efficiency as a positive impact to gross margins over time, but we will also accelerate improvements by generating roughly $1 billion of savings in non-variable cost of sales in 2025. Once again, these reductions do not impact our ability to execute our plan. We designed our Smart Capital strategy to enable us to conservatively manage the day-to-day business to trendline growth while maintaining the operational flexibility to quickly and cost-effectively capture upside when it comes.\nWe are taking the bold step of suspending the dividend at the beginning of the fourth quarter, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy. We reiterate our long term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels. Reductions across OpEx, CapEx, and cost of sales total well over $10 billion in direct savings in 2025 and provides clear line of sight to a sustainable model with the ongoing financial resources and liquidity needed to support our long term strategy. We remain confident that we have and will continue to make the investments needed to drive long term shareholder value and we view cost discipline as the compass that drives effective execution, helping teams stay on track to both prioritize and achieve measurable results.\nThe operational and capital improvements we are driving will be especially important as we manage the business through the near term. While we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth through the rest of the year, the pace of the recovery will be slower than expected, which is reflected in our Q3 outlook. Specifically, Q3 will be impacted by a modest inventory digestion in CCG, DCAI, and our more cyclical businesses of NEX, Altera, and Mobileye. Trending below our original forecast, our outlook reflects industry-wide conditions without any meaningful change in our market share expectations. As we look into Q4, normal seasonal revenue growth has historically been in a range of flat to up 5% quarter on quarter. With improved client inventory levels exiting Q3, we see Q4 revenue at the high end of that range.\nLet me now provide more details on our key business units starting with Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership with our aggressive five nodes in four years march, and the finish line is officially within sight. We are well into the ramp of Intel 4, Intel 3, and Intel 20A is being readied for production next quarter on Intel 18A. We released the 1.0 PDK last month and are on track to be manufacturing ready by the end of this year with production wafer start volumes in H1 2025. Panther Lake for client is now running Windows and looking very healthy. This is the first microprocessor to use RibbonFET, PowerVia, and advanced packaging, achieving a significant milestone. Clearwater Forest processor, which also includes Foveros Direct and other key advanced packaging capabilities, is booted and likewise looking very healthy.\nThese are the first of many Intel 18A products on track to bring Intel 18A to the mass market. Importantly, the launch of 18A will be our fifth node in four years, completing an historic pace of design and process innovation and returning Intel to process leadership. Our team is resolute and determined to finish what we started and once we do it will unlock further growth and value creation across our foundry and product businesses. Our investments in a global footprint of leading edge capacity continues to weigh on near term profitability, but long term they position us to profitably participate in the largest and fastest growing parts of the semiconductor market. We continue to expect the investments we're driving through this year to put us on a course for meaningful financial traction with operating profits for Intel Foundry troughing in 2024 and then driving to break even.\nTo help accelerate our foundry services business. Kevin has led large foundry and fabless businesses outside Intel and is a great addition to our leadership team. He has hit the ground running, spending considerable time with current and future foundry customers as we ramp our process, packaging, and chipset capabilities for the AI era. We are also pleased to welcome Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron later this month to lead our foundry manufacturing and supply chain organization. He brings more than 20 years of leadership in deep technical R&D and manufacturing expertise that will help advance our priorities. Overall, our foundry team is driving excellent collaboration with our design ecosystem partners. In Q2, ANSYS, Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys all announced the availability of reference flows for Intel's embedded multi-die interconnect bridge advanced packaging technology.\nEMIB makes it possible to cost-effectively scale to a larger silicon area by connecting multiple die in a single package, which simplifies the design process and offers design flexibility. These same partners also declared readiness for Intel 18A designs, and we will be collaborating closely with the ecosystem in the second half to prepare for next year's 18A launches. Beyond Intel 18A, we are well on our way to Intel 14A and Intel 10A development. Even as we continue to extend leadership and innovation on our process roadmap, we are transitioning to a more normal cadence of node development. The normalized cadence will have positive implications for both pace and magnitude of ongoing R&D and capital spending requirements. Let's now turn to Intel products in our largest and most profitable business, CCG. We continue to strengthen our position and execute well against our roadmap.\nThe AI PC category is transforming every aspect of the compute experience, and Intel is at the forefront of this category, creating momentum. Intel Core Ultra volume more than doubled sequentially in Q2 and is already powering AI capabilities across more than 300 applications and 500 AI models. This is an ongoing testament to the strong ecosystem we have nurtured through 40 years of consistent investments. We have now shipped more than 15 million Windows AI PCs since our December launch, multiples more than all of our competitors combined, and we remain on track to ship more than 40 million AI PCs by year-end and over 100 million accumulative by the end of 2025. Lunar Lake, our next-generation AI PC which achieved production release ahead of schedule in July, will be the next industry-wide catalyst for device refresh.\nLunar Lake delivers superior performance at half the power with 50% better graphics performance and 40% more power efficiency versus the prior generation. Lunar Lake delivers 3x more TOPS gen on gen with our enhanced NPU and will be the ultimate AI CPU on the shelf for the holiday cycle. Microsoft has qualified Lunar Lake to power more than 80 new Copilot+ PCs across more than 20 OEMs which will begin to ship this quarter.\nLunar Lake will quickly be joined by Arrow Lake which will scale AI to the desktop category next quarter, and as mentioned earlier, we are already gearing up to launch Panther Lake next year to further extend our leadership position. So very good progress in CCG and a super strong roadmap over the next 18 months. Let me now turn to DCAI. This is one of the most important areas of focus as we work to improve our performance and market position. We have a strong foundation on which to build, including the more than 130 million Xeons powering data centers around the world today, and our roadmap is designed to build upon this vast installed base to deliver greater performance and efficiency, enable AI solutions that are open, flexible, and scalable, and reduce total cost of ownership for customers.\nWe took some important steps forward this quarter, starting with the launch of Xeon 6 with E-core processors, formerly code-named Sierra Forest. This is our first Intel 3 product and is particularly well suited for high-density scale-out workloads. It drives performance up, power down, and dramatic rack consolidation. Early adopters are already seeing 25% better performance per watt versus competitive solutions. This will be followed by Xeon 6 with P-core codenamed Granite Rapids, which delivers greater performance for the most demanding workloads and will begin shipping this quarter. Looking to the future, we are excited about the launch of Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product featuring our industry-leading hybrid bonding. Clearwater Forest has achieved power-on and is on track to launch in 2025.\nAs we reestablish Xeon's competitive position, we are strongly positioned as the head node of choice in AI servers. We are also focused on improving our accelerator roadmap. We're delivering a combination of performance, flexibility, and value that is very compelling to customers, particularly cloud and enterprises seeking scalable, cost-effective gen AI solutions. Our focus on open models, open developer frameworks, and reference designs combining Xeon with accelerators through OPEA or Open Platform for enterprise AI are gaining considerable market traction. Launching in Q3, Gaudi 3 will take our accelerator performance to the next level at just 2/3 the cost of competitive offerings. To put it into perspective, we expect Gaudi 3 to deliver roughly 2x performance per dollar on both inference and training versus H100. Gaudi 3 has strong ecosystem support including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Foxconn, GIGABYTE, Inventec, Quanta Cloud Technology, and Wistron.\nTurning to NEX, we continue to see stability in Q2 while introducing new products that will expand our leadership in edge and networking into the future. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, we announced an array of AI-optimized scale-out Ethernet solutions including the Intel AI Network Interface Card and Foundry chiplets, which will launch next year. A recent IPU adapter for the enterprise supported by Dell Technologies and Red Hat broadens access to the solution co-developed with Google Cloud. We expect the IPU to be accretive to growth and profitability as it becomes an increasingly important part of acceleration in the AI data center. We also announced the creation of Ultra Accelerator Link, a new industry standard dedicated to advancing high-speed, low-latency communication for scale-up AI systems, communication, and data centers.\nCombined with a growing number of use cases of AI on the edge, NEX is well positioned to be an accretive growth driver in 2025 and beyond. Lastly, as Altera reaches full operational separation by year-end, we are actively working toward capitalizing the business to generate proceeds for Intel on a path to an IPO in the coming years. We are excited to provide Altera with the mandate, focus, and resources to realize their growth opportunities and execute their strategy. We expect their increased autonomy will help to drive value for our shareholders similar to the decisions we made with Mobileye two years ago, and IMS last year. Before I turn to Dave, let me sum up by saying it has been a hard-fought first half of the year.\nWe have achieved several important milestones, and we are taking clear and decisive actions to improve our sustainable financial performance. We have entered Q3 with a very clear focus and renewed intensity to up our game and are motivated by the progress we are seeing as we execute our strategy and realize our vision. That is the mindset driving us forward as we continue to build a stronger Intel. With that, I'll pass it over to Dave.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down 1% year over year and up 1% sequentially. Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction, which negatively impacted our client business in China. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered 4% year over year growth offset by headwinds. In our more cyclical businesses, profitability was significantly more challenged versus our previous expectations with Q2 gross margin of 38.7% and EPS of $0.02 weaker than expected. Gross margin was due to three main drivers. The largest impact was caused by an accelerated ramp of our AI PC product.\nIn addition to exceeding expectations on Q2 core Altera shipments, we made the decision to accelerate transition of Intel 4 and 3 wafers from our development fab in Oregon to our high volume facility in Ireland where wafer costs are higher in the near term. However, this change resulted in approximately $1 billion of capital savings and will improve Intel 4 and 3 gross margin long term. As we scale up the Ireland Fab, margins were also impacted by higher than typical period charges related to non-core businesses and charges associated with unused capacity. Finally, we saw an unfavorable product mix and more competitive pricing than expected. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, up approximately $3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital.\nGross CapEx of $5.7 billion was more than offset by $11.5 billion in grants and partner contributions, highlighted by Apollo's SCIP investment in our Ireland factory operations, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion.\nIntel products revenue was $11.8 billion, up 4% year over year. The client business grew 9% year over year as the AI PC ramp contributed to higher volume and ASPs, partially offset by export license restrictions communicated during the quarter.\nDCAI revenue was roughly flat sequentially and down three points year over year. We expect sequential growth in the data center through the second half as demand for traditional servers improves modestly. Revenue for the NEX business was approximately flat both sequentially and year over year, though excluding the previously discussed inventory digestion impacting the telco market. NEX delivered 10% year over year growth in the first half. Q2 operating profit for Intel products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue, and up approximately $400 million year over year on higher revenue and reduced inventory reserves.\nIntel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1 point sequentially and up 4% year over year driven by increased wafer volume on Intel 7 and our first EUV nodes. Intel 4 and 3 foundry services revenue more than doubled sequentially off a small base including the start of advanced packaging revenue.\nFoundry operating loss of $2.8 billion was worse sequentially. We expect operating losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q3, with more than 85% of wafer volume still coming from pre-EUV nodes with an uncompetitive cost structure and power, performance, and area deficits reflected in market-based pricing. The continued ramp of our Intel 4 and 3 Ireland facility and elevated R&D and startup costs to support the rapid progression of our leading-edge technology development will also weigh on profitability.\nMobileye revenue of $440 million improved 84% sequentially due to non-recurrence of the significant inventory drawdown that occurred in Q1. The rapid revenue and margin recovery indicates digestion occurred in an organized, predictable fashion and we believe it is now complete. However, difficult conditions in China, which are impacting many western automotive suppliers, led Mobileye to lower their revenue and income guidance for the second half.\nAltera delivered revenue of $361 million, up 6% sequentially, with operating margins improving 4 points in the quarter. Revenue remains below consumption as inventory positions tied to previous supply constraints are worked down. We expect double digit sequential revenue growth through the second half as customers return to more normal buying patterns.\nNow, turning to our Q3 guidance. Weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, and continued focus on AI server investments in the cloud have reduced our TAM expectations for 2024. As a result, customer inventory levels are elevated. We expect customers to reduce inventory over the second half of the year, along with the continued modest negative impact from export controls. These market dynamics should result in below seasonal revenue growth in Q3, with the client business flat to down and modest growth in data center and edge markets. With an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and the continuation of an enterprise refresh cycle, we should see revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter.\nWe expect gross margins to be moderately weaker sequentially with modest revenue growth and efficiencies offset by a continued ramp of new manufacturing nodes. While we will continue our work to improve near-term profitability, a heavier dependence on external wafers as we ramp AI PC products over the next several quarters will pressure gross margins.\nAs a result of these factors, we expect revenue of $12.5 to 13.5 billion in Q3. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 38% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.03, all on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs Pat discussed earlier, lower than anticipated revenue in the back half of the year is putting pressure on gross margins and earnings. We are taking aggressive actions to significantly reduce spending in response. These actions, while difficult, will help streamline the organization to improve productivity and make better decisions more quickly. Please note that we are likely to have charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance. Smart Capital continues to guide the pace and breadth of our global capacity expansion, and our new operating model has uncovered opportunities to build and utilize manufacturing capacity more efficiently.\nAdditionally, we've responded to lower revenue by reducing 2024 gross capital investments to a range of $25 to 27 billion, with a net capital spending of $11 to 13 billion, including our SCIP programs. These adjustments ordinarily would bring us back to approximately breakeven adjusted free cash flow, but we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be modestly negative as we make payments related to the restructuring charges necessary to achieve our spending targets in 2025. With OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and net CapEx of $12 to $14 billion, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. The suspension of the dividend, initial Altera capitalization, and positive adjusted free cash flow should significantly improve our liquidity in 2025 and position us to begin the process of meaningfully decreasing our leverage.\nBefore I close, let me take a moment to highlight a couple items as you model 2025. As previously mentioned, we expect operating expenses to be reduced from street expectations of $21 billion to approximately $17.5 billion. We will also reduce spending within non-variable cost of sales by approximately $1 billion. While that will obviously have a positive impact on gross margins, we still only expect a roughly 60% fall through for gross margin next year. The AI PC is a big winner for the company, and the early signals on the performance of Lunar Lake are very positive. We therefore intend to ramp that product significantly next year to meet market demand. While the part is great, it was originally a narrowly targeted product using largely external wafers and not optimized for cost. As a result, our gross margins will likely be up only modestly next year.\nThe good news is the follow-on product. Panther Lake is internally sourced on 18A and has a much improved cost structure as the momentum of AI PCs drives Panther Lake demand. Together with the improvements from our new operating model and the cost savings from our lower capital spending, we will be in a great position to see meaningful gross margin expansion in subsequent years. Lastly, the non-controlled income from Mobileye, Altera, and IMS. The portion of the SCIP earned by our partners shows up on a line below net income called non-controlling interest. The NCI adjustment has been negligible so far, but we expect it to be a more meaningful driver, reducing our controlled share of income by approximately $700 million on a GAAP basis in 2025 and increasing as wafer production at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland increases in subsequent years.\nIn closing, the market has not recovered as expected, and we're obviously not satisfied with our results. We're responding by aggressively adjusting CapEx spending to achieve profitability and positive adjusted free cash flow that is commensurate with the current market conditions while continuing to invest in and execute our strategy. In addition to these near-term actions, we're also seeing meaningful opportunities to improve financial results leveraging our new operating model. We remain optimistic that reduced spending, operating efficiencies, and more competitive products will keep us on track to our target model of 60% gross margin and 40% operating margin by the end of the decade. I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow up question where appropriate. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first caller?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question please.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. In that big picture, are the challenges the product issue, market issue, strategic issue, execution issue? I'm just wondering, have the core issues been accurately diagnosed? Because when we look at your CPU competitor, they appear to be doing much better in this same environment. So I'm curious, what is Plan B if just cost cuts don't do the job?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, Vivek. To start out, we'd say that this first phase of the recovery, restoration, and rebuilding plan is now well underway with 18A PDK 1.0, with Panther Lake, Clearwater Forest powered on, our GEO footprint now starting to take shape. We have more competitive products in every segment of the industry. That said, with that foundation in place, it's time for us to focus on phase two, building a more financially sustainable model for the company for the future. Many of the new products are yet to ramp into the marketplace, and we're just now getting to competitiveness. But we need to build a more sustainable business model for us that allows us to have the financial wherewithal for the long-term journey. I'd say this rebuilding that we're underway; this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel since the transition from memory to microprocessors four decades ago.\nWe firmly believe in the IDM 2.0 strategy. We're building two world class companies. The forensics that we've done this year, this clean sheet exercise, as we could describe it, is building a world class Intel foundry and building a world class Intel products group. You know, these efforts we believe have identified many opportunities for us to have, you know, financial savings. We've launched those aggressive steps today and we believe that with the new products, a better financial position that we've done for a more efficient operation, that we see the long term opportunity for significant value creation for all of our stakeholders.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nVivek, do you have a follow-up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you, John, for my follow-up. I'm curious, what impact do the restrictions, sorry, the restructuring actions have on either your R&D roadmap, your long-term external foundry opportunity, and any CHIPS Act funding? I think in the past you had suggested about $15 billion in long-term value from external foundry. Is there any impact on those growth targets because of the restructuring action? Just what changes with these restructuring actions? Thank you.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you, Vivek. And fundamentally we believe our strategy will be maintained even as we get these more efficient steps in place. The CHIPS grants, taking your questions one by one on the CHIPS side, these are milestone-based investments. We still believe that we're comfortably able to execute against those milestones across the projects that we've announced. So we believe very comfortably that the CHIPS model that we've put in place. We've worked closely with the CHIPS Program Office and the US Government. We're very comfortable on those plans. Also, the Foundry, we're seeing a lot of momentum in areas like the advanced packaging areas where we're actually seeing quite a lot of uptake and expansion of those opportunities.\nSo the $15 billion of LDV that we've talked about and the $15 billion revenue by the end of the decade, we're very confident that those are still very solid guidelines for us to be building to. Obviously with the capital changes that we've made, we're going to be driving, just like a world class foundry does, to be much more efficient with our capital investments and scrutinizing them more carefully. Now that we've paid the capital to catch up, this catch up capital, we had no spare capacity, we had no sight ahead, shell ahead, we had no capacity to catch up.\nAs those investments are now largely completed, we're able to focus much more on capital efficiency for the future and aligning our capital spend to the market signals as we see to the future of our products as well as the foundry, you know, commitments that we have in place. You know, finally, I'll just say again, you know, we're building this against the market outlook. We're going to flex our investments, you know, up and down appropriately. And we've now established the model with our Smart Capital to have that effectiveness that we can scale up and down, you know, to market conditions. So we feel like all of the things that we said for our strategy on track and we're now moving into phase two of the execution of that strategy.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Kind of want to follow up on the first two. Pat, maybe just ask it a different way. Part of what you're saying, it sounds like you're adjusting your spending across the board to reflect the macro reality, slower growth, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut it seems like that would be difficult to do if it didn't impact any of the structural dynamics as well. So I guess the real question is, are there any changes either to your competitiveness, the structure of the company, and the long-term $100 billion target that you just saw weren't happening and therefore felt these cuts were necessary. So do any of the structural changes or can you describe any of the structural changes and what the outcome to your financial targets might be?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Let me point you back to what I said at the start. We started this forensics, this clean sheet analysis concurrent with the rolling out of our new operational model. We said we have to be a world class foundry. We are going to benchmark ourselves against world class foundries. And that's what Intel Foundry is going to become. And that's uncovered a lot of things, a lot of inefficiencies, a lot of ways that we can drive our capital footprint more effectively. Every aspect of that business is being analyzed and how we do maintenance, how we procure chemicals, how we run and price wafers and shuttle lots, and everything like that. So clean sheet analysis. Similarly, on the product side, we've done exactly that same analysis. What does a world class fabless company look like?\nWe uncover quite a lot of areas where we don't leverage industry IPs. We're not using our EDA vendors as effectively. We've done too many steppings. We validate versus build in design quality. So many of these things are steps that we're taking to be a world class fabless company. And these are significant structural steps. We also realize that as an IDM 1.0, we were never built for efficiency; we were built for leadership. And now as we add this focus on efficiency, we see a lot of opportunities. I'm having each of the four business areas, client, networking, and data center, look at their own portfolios, even though those are the right product areas for us for the future. And similarly the portfolio of our Intel Foundry business. And that's the work that we've now been undertaking.\nWe're now accelerating, based on the less than expected quarterly results, those impacts. We're going to drive that in the second half of this year. We want to get these restructurings done quickly so that we can move forward more aggressively with the product lines next year. In terms of the long term forecast, we're clearly tempering our view of how fast we can grow in the near term based on the market conditions. But our model is built that we will scale up or scale down the capital requirements appropriate to the market conditions. We see, we believe the long term guides that we've given you, the 60, 40, you know, getting to the foundry business model; we've described the growth areas that we've said, you know, as those are larger portions of our business, we believe those are long term, still achievable in that regard.\nWe're on track, you know, for many of those things in the models that we're laying out. Today's actions will help accelerate us achieving those.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, I do. Dave, you went through with good details. The cost structure and what would change the puts and takes for next year. I wondered, I know you're not going to guide to 2025 revenue, but the puts and takes from maybe a competitive positioning point of view, how you're feeling in CCG, DCAI primarily relative to the competition, any sort of tailwind, headwind analysis, or description for 25 would be helpful.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, sure. On the client side, you know, obviously we feel very good given our AI PC position where we're leading that.\nNew product category. And you know, I think we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about Lunar Lake, our next product coming in after Meteor Lake, and the performance of that. So that looks like a phenomenally good product and position. You know, we're making the early inroads on the AI side of data center and that's only going to grow as we go into next year. The big question is when does the traditional CPU market recover? It has been tempered this year and of course affected by other regions of the world like China spending and so forth. That's obviously been a soft space and so we'll have to see how that plays out. And then NEX obviously also outside of the telco space is starting to recover and then we have these other businesses, you know, Altera is starting to recover now.\nSo we're optimistic that next year will be a good year for them, and you know, we'll have to see how Mobileye plays out ultimately. I think on the margin front, you know, I talked about our kind of tempered view of gross margins next year given the ramp of Lunar Lake, which, you know, with memory and package, and you know, almost all of the material getting sourced outside and they're seeing, we're seeing inflation in that space, you know, that, that is impacting it. But you know, that part is followed by Panther Lake that comes back into the fab. And I think one of the bigger stories we'll have once we get beyond next year is, you know, kind of the resurgence of our internal facilities to start taking on a lot of the capacity that we had to move into.\nExternal sources should provide some meaningful improvement in terms of profitability. And then, of course, you know, we've done a lot of, as Pat talked about, in terms of restructuring the business, and those will start to show up next year, but will be even more impactful the following year, including the new operating model. So, I think the good news for us is we actually don't need a ton of growth to see our model play out both in the kind of medium term, and long term in terms of gross margins and operating margins. And if we do get the growth, it puts us even in even better position.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, thank you for taking the question. I guess, Dave, a follow up to that prior question was hoping you could perhaps speak to, you know, how to think about gross margins beyond 25. You know, it's obviously very hard to offer the leverage when you're investing in both foundry capacity and at the same time outsourcing meaningful tiles to TSMC. So encouraging that you're bringing Panther Lake back in house. How should we think about incremental margins there? And any of the other kind of moving parts that you've been speaking about on this call, including the unfavorable product mix and the more competitive pricing? Is that just a near term kind of phenomenon or something else we should be thinking about, you know, into 2025, 2026.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, yeah. So as I talked about to Ross, CJ, you know, the good news for 2026 for us is that that really begins the shift back to the internal manufacturing footprint for a lot of our tiles. And so bringing back more wafers to the internal network will meaningfully improve the cost structure. You know, I think the adjustments in CapEx, which are clearly helpful in terms of cash flow in the near term, become really beneficial to the cost structure as depreciation becomes kind of a less of a headwind for us. So that will also be helpful.\nThen like I said, you know, we've got all these structural improvements that are coming our way both from the actions we've taken today, but the new, you know, the new operating model and decisions will get made on a go forward basis that will just optimize our business model going forward. I think, you know, 2026 should be a good year for us in terms of gross margins. We'll save the actual number for a later date when we have more visibility into how things are playing out. I think from a mix perspective, it's probably not going to be a big.\nHeadwind or tailwind for us, just strict mix. Other than as we move toward more leading edge wafers, the margins on those wafers are significantly better than the margins in pre-EUV nodes. So that will be one factor that will certainly help us in that regard. That also helps us on the pricing side because obviously from a wafer perspective, we get better pricing on EUV wafers as opposed to pre-EUV wafers.\nAnd then ultimately, I think on pricing it will really come down to when we have a competitive process and we have competitive products running on a competitive process and we're delivering what the customers want. That helps us in terms of the pricing dynamic and we're getting to the place, as Pat talked about, where we're starting to deliver on all those fronts. And so I feel good about our opportunity to realize that in the form of pricing as we progress through for the next few years.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nJust one thing to add on top of that, just to clarify, with Panther Lake already powered on. Right. Showing good health, you know, that is a product that we start ramping in the second half of next year. Right. So, you know, we'll start to see some of those benefits. But obviously the huge volume benefits of that really are in 2026, where we'll be very aggressive at bringing both the wafers home on a more competitive process, with a more competitive product with Panther Lake offsetting the volumes of Lunar Lake, which is almost entirely outsourced. So we bring Tiles home with a more competitive product on a more competitive process. And that really is, I'll say, the story that will start to unfold as we talk to you more next year.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nCJ, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, just a quick one. On OpEx, you gave us the $175 for all of calendar 2025, but could you share with us what you think the exit rate would look like? I'm coming to around $4.25 billion. Is that in the ballpark?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I'll say, you know, given that some of the actions we're taking will kind of go through at least the early part of next year, we're going to enter at a higher number than we're going to exit, I'll give you that. We should be down in 2026 relative to 2025. Give me some time as we progress through the year to start to fine tune the budget for 2026 and I'll give you more clarity around that.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, CJ. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. You talked about the server roadmap with Sierra Forest shipping and Granite Rapids shipping this quarter. Can you talk about, you know, how that where that puts you competitively? Do you think you're kind of have closed the gap or is it a leadership product? And, you know, obviously Clearwater Forest is the longer term focus, but where are we in the interim?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you. And obviously Sierra Forest E-core product, very efficient, but a new category for us. So we have to go win sockets with it. Early customer feedback, very positive, as we said, greater than 25% TCO value that they're seeing from it. But it's early in its ramp. Granite Rapids is really the P-core, I'll say the more traditional Xeon for us. And we'll start that ramp this quarter. But it will take time in the server market. You know, winning back share, winning back sockets is a longer term cycle for that. But a lot of encouraging signs for Granite Rapids, even though a lot of the data center energy right now is on the AI buildout, as you know. So in this environment, you know, we're largely facing a period where much of the investment energy is going into the AI footprint.\nSo we're having to fight to win those sockets back. But Granite Rapids looks very positive. The early health of Clearwater Forest is really spectacular. This is a really stunning technical achievement with the new design 18A. This level of health this early in a major server product is really spectacular. The new Foveros Direct and should have substantial TCO benefits for next year. And then the next P-core version of that on 18A is also showing very good, you know, not in fab yet, but showing very good design progress. So we feel like the roadmap gets more competitive and with it, you know, we believe our market share position is fairly right, I'll say, you know, static right. Year on year, you know, we do see that overall the ARM market share is more modest in the second half this year. So the x86 shares.\nWe're stabilizing our overall position in the marketplace. We believe as we then go to fight to win back. One of the good things that we've seen for our server market is the AI head nodes where we're quite advantaged. We're seeing a lot of interest in Xeon being the head node of choice for anybody's accelerator, including ours. A lot of things to unpack there. We do feel like our position is stabilizing and strengthening with our products and the roadmap only improves from here.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a follow up?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, just on the notion that AI has kind of stolen some of the focus from server. It seems like we would be looking at a ceiling in overall power budgets in a couple of years. That would mean we need to invest in traditional server ecosystems and maybe do a significant refresh. You know, do you see any indications of that? And given that, you know, I perceive you guys are sort of stronger in enterprise than in cloud right now. Like, how are you positioned to take advantage of that when it does come?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Joe. And we do think that the enterprise market, right, is a more favorable market for us and we do have some early indications of positive cycle there. But I'll say it's too early to give you any real firm indications. But we are starting to see, I'll say better buying behavior, better signals from our OEMs in the enterprise market. Similarly for the cloud market, we do believe there will be a refresh cycle, right, as people get their AI strategies in place. The TCO benefits of a server refresh. Now, as we start talking about 3x-4x consolidation ratios that they can have on their traditional cloud environments, their container delivery environments, these are quite substantial.\nSo we do believe that as our products get to be more competitive and there is a natural refresh cycle on that, the markets will be more favorable for the traditional CPU market. But of course the story is CPU plus GPU. Right? And that's the bigger message that we'll be delivering. And obviously as Gaudi 3 starts shipping the CPU plus GPU use cases like we've described with OPEA, that will also help us for positioning on both sides of the cloud and the enterprise market for both CPU and GPU. That's the strategy that we're building toward.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nSure. Thanks. Dave. Can you again explain how June gross margin was so much worse than you thought just three months ago? I mean, you know, revenue is basically in line. I know you talked about mix, but it seems like it was probably a pretty small part of it. Mix was, and it was really more the decisions around Intel 4 and 3. So can you just explain again? I'm not sure I understand why that was such a big.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation",
    "content2": "Okay, that was the biggest one. I'll just say that there were a couple other things that we had to do. Some write-offs related to legacy businesses that impacted us. Our utilization was a bit lower. That did impact us. But the biggest one was the shift. We were originally planning to ramp Meteor Lake Intel 3 and even run production on Intel 4 and then run production on Intel 3 in Oregon, which is our TD fab, our process technology fab, kind of our development fab. We made the decision to more quickly shift all of that over to Ireland. And it's a good move because it saves capital. We don't have to spend capital twice essentially and it starts to mature the Intel 4 and 3 processes in Ireland more quickly. The downside of that is the wafers are expensive right now.\nAnd so, you know, we get this kind of early ramp of the product at a much higher wafer cost that we're pushing through the system, and that puts pressure on the margins that's going to carry into next quarter. I mean, we will do better in next quarter obviously, but we're going to do more volume, and the margins will be, you know, below the corporate average because, while we're improving the wafer cost, you know, it's still not to the point where it's above corporate average yet. And so it will weigh down on margins for Q3 as well. After that, you know, we start, it gets more and more mature, the cost structure gets better, and you know, the situation on Meteor Lake will improve meaningfully.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nYeah. Pat, can you just talk about the foundry strategy given the CapEx cut? I guess my question is how you sort of execute on the plan with this lower CapEx? I mean, kind of on one hand we keep talking about bringing all these wafers back in house to help gross margin in 2026, but I also hear about a lot more outsourcing to TSMC, even in real time. So is the cut more that some of your foundry customers are maybe structurally deciding that they're not as committed? I'm just trying to understand how you can cut CapEx and still execute on the foundry strategy. Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you. And at the highest level, the foundry strategy unchanged and we've built capacity corridor for foundry customers. However, until we have committed orders, we're going to be modest on how much equipment we put against the shelves and the sites that we have in place, and how much of that corridor we keep available. How much flexibility working with our equipment suppliers that we need for that will be a subject of careful scrutiny as we go forward. You know, we're also made some adjustments in the capital investment that we need to support our current view of market forecast. So all of those are adjustments. You know, the big thing is now that we're finishing this phase of aggressive build out.\nRight as you think about what we had to catch up, you know, we had no EUV capacity, we had no scale, no High-NA, you know, capacity. We had no capacity to pull tiles home as those come into place. We've been making substantial capital investments over the last couple of years, and now we're focused on how do we harvest those investments in 2024, 2025, and 2026. So we're putting much more aggressive view of capital utilization. Right. How much capital required ahead working with the suppliers to be more efficient in our capital dollars, just like a foundry does. And for that we'll, you know, point you back to again. Right. We're going to be a world class, fabless company, Intel Products. We're going to be a world class foundry with Intel Foundry.\nThe last point I'd make here on this is a lot of the early success that we're having with Foundry customers is advanced packaging. And there the capital requirements are not as significant as required for wafer capacity. So we believe very much that we're seeing a surge of interest there. You know, customers in advanced packaging are clearly interested in us for capacity, but increasingly for our most advanced packaging technology. So that's an area that we believe we have, as we described before as the on ramp for Intel Foundry. And that's continuing to look very good. You know, the final point is the Intel Foundry capacity will be aligned with, right to the first order, the Intel product requirements.\nClearly, as a lot of tiles externally in 2025, we bring those home in 2026, that's when we'll start to really, as Dave said, see the benefits of the model that we've put in place. Tiles coming home, leadership process technology leadership products starts in 2025, deliver big time in 2026 and beyond.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you. A couple of follow-ups. Dave, on the move from Oregon to Ireland Fab. You talked about that being a gross margin headwind. Can you talk about how much, can you clarify how much of a headwind that is right now and also when it's fully loaded on a like, for like basis, how much of a headwind do you think that's going to be on an ongoing basis?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI'm sorry, the second question is how much will the headwind be on an ongoing basis?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nOn an ongoing basis is what you're saying?\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nOngoing basis. Yeah.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nOkay. All right. So I think the best way to think about it is, you know, we were, I don't know, 400 basis points or so off on the gross margin. Take into account revenue was part of it. You know, it was a meaningful chunk of that 400 basis points. There was the write-offs related to legacy businesses and the you know, mix and underutilization also affected it. And it wasn't an insignificant amount, but that was a good portion of that 400 basis points, let's call it that. And that will be the case in the third quarter, probably given the increase. I think we're talking about a 50% increase in Meteor Lake quarter over quarter in the third quarter. Beyond that, it's going to start to become less and less to the point where it's actually not going to be a headwind.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, it becomes a tailwind as the Ireland factory ramps. A production factory will have a lower cost per wafer start than a TD factory like Oregon. So it becomes a headwind as we go into next year, tailwind as we go.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nSo now, as we know, the challenge for next year will be we'll be ramping Lunar Lake next year. Lunar Lake has the memory in the package, so we're going to have to essentially buy that at a price and turn around and, you know, include that in our price at 0% margin. So that puts some negative pressure on the margins, and additionally it's got more of the content sourced externally, and as you know, we're seeing some inflation. So that one then becomes more of the headwind. Meteor Lake starts to be helpful, but Lunar Lake starts to become a drag on the Intel products margins, which is why we were tempered in terms of our outlook for margins next year because we're going to have a lot of improvements on the Intel foundry side.\nIt's going to be tempered on the product side, and it's really going to be because of Lunar Lake.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nI was just going to add one thing. As we move the Intel 4, 3 capacity into Ireland, it also gives our TD team more focus on their CapEx on 18A, as well as then 14A and 10A. We're taking, for instance, the second High-NA tool is coming into our Oregon facility. So we're well underway on 14A. So part of this was a capacity and cost decision for the long term. Part of it was an AI PC acceleration, but it was also a TD cadence decision in optimizing the use of our TD resources for the next generation technologies, which are already well underway and showing good early indicators.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nSrini, do you have a quick follow on?\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nYeah. So Pat, I think in the past you talked about the foundry business potentially breaking even sometime 2027, and given all the cuts and you seem to at least sound confident that foundry opportunity is not changing. So I'm just curious, do you see a possibility that foundry business could actually break even sooner given all the cuts?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYou know, clearly that's our objective for Dave, and I'll say that said, we have a lot of wood to chop until we complete that journey. The steps that we've taken today are significant ones for our operational efficiency that we're putting in place. So clearly that's our operating objective that we have. But as we said, 2026 is really this year that many of these wafers come home, many of the new factory investments come online, and the new products technologies. So I'd say that 2027 timeframe is still a good one. But you can trust that every aspect of what we're doing is to accelerate the profitability. And the significant announcement today of the cost and financial focus will give us, I'll say, the scrutiny and the lens by which to focus our Intel foundry.\n$10 billion next year is a big number, and we expect that many of these operational improvements will carry forward in 2026. Dave said an acceleration of our adjusted free cash flow turning positive. So everything that we're doing is aligned with that thought. Srini.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Srini. Jonathan, we've got time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsey from TD Cowen. Your question please.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you, guys.\nI guess my first question is on the client space. I think Dave, you might have mentioned client flat to down in September. I think your primary x86 competitor is going to be up double digits or I think they mentioned above seasonal, however you quantify seasonal. Now maybe you could give us a little color there. There's lots of maybe noise in the system about ARM coming into the client market. I think that impact would be more modest relative to what you described.\nBut if you could kind of give us your take there and how the inventory with OEMs might be affecting what you're guiding for this September. Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I'll take that, Matt. And you know, we feel very good with our client position, the momentum we have in AI PC, we have a very healthy ecosystem as well. And I'll say as the large market share position that we have, we're very focused on sell in and sell through in the channel. So I believe our overall view of inventory levels, you know, where our market share is, we're actually quite comfortable in the indications that we've given, you know, some, you know, inventory sell through in the Q3 above seasonal in Q4. Overall the TAM expansion, you know, is low single digit. Even though we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm around the AI PC and further TAM expansion as we go into 2025 is expected.\nNow broadly, we'd also say that our position in the commercial portion of this market is very strong with our VPro assets, and we believe we're coming into a refresh cycle on the corporate. We also saw things like VPro have great success for customers as they were dealing with the CrowdStrike blue screen period. Customers who are VPro customers were able to recover in a day or so, where customers not on VPro took weeks to recover from that. So, a lot of reinforcement of the ecosystem. The leadership that we have on AI PC and, as Dave said, Lunar Lake and Panther Lake only make our market position stronger. So, I think we're very comfortable, and every indication so far this quarter is very solid for those outcomes.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nMatt, do you have a quick follow-on?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYes, I do. Thanks, John. I wanted to ask you, I think in some of the prepared script and maybe early in the Q&A, Pat, you kind of reiterated the $15 billion funnel for the foundry business. I know in the medium term a lot of that is packaging, but I wanted to ask about the customers that you've engaged with on 18A and maybe early on 14A. How have you seen the Gantt charts of the programs that they're planning to bring into your foundry? Progress in the last few quarters, are people still committed to ramping those things? Are they taking PDKs and maybe doing tape-ins? Are things moving forward? Have you seen any acceleration? Have you seen hesitation or maybe wait-and-see from those customers? I'm just trying to figure out how that stuff is progressing on 18A. Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Let me just clarify. The $15 billion is lifetime deal value of committed deals, right? So this is a pipeline, this is committed business that we now have in place. So I just want to clarify that. Matt, I think your question suggests that the pipeline, there's a lot more in the pipeline. This is $15 billion of committed deals. As you say, a lot of the near-term opportunity has been advanced packaging and we're seeing significant expansion of that capability in terms of volume and technology. On 18A specifically, a lot of customers have been waiting for the PDK. And now that we released the PDK last month, the 1.0 PDK, we've seen a flurry of activity with the EDA, the IP vendors, and the end customers. So I'd be optimistic that we have good indicators coming in that area in the future.\nBut this was really the starting point for many of them to go from test chips to start looking at production chips coming. Based on the PDK that we've just released, we remain very comfortable with our earlier comments in that area, and I'd say we do believe that we'll have further updates there. But as we've also indicated, customers are reluctant to put their name out there given the supply base and the traditional operation of the foundry industry. Overall, things are looking on track for what we've said with a meaningful acceleration in packaging over the last quarter. More updates to come. Maybe with that, John, I'll wrap us up. You know, thank you for joining our call.\nWe appreciate the time as always, and I'd say on a couple of these topics, I hope to see many of you at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference coming up, where we'll have some further updates. You know, I want to reiterate in a quarter like this that we are resolved to finish the audacious turnaround, the building of our process and product key milestones that we've achieved this phase, but now we have to shift to putting more emphasis on the financial sustainability of our business. We're making difficult decisions as we right size, we rebuild a more efficient, leaner, agile Intel for the future, and one that we're confident will enable our long-term success. Thanks and good afternoon everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.\nThank you for standing by, and welcome to Intel Corporation's Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star 1 1 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 1 1 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now you should have received a copy of the Q2 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO Pat Gelsinger and our CFO David Zinsner. In a moment we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains reference to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.\nOur earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate, to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 profitability was disappointing despite continued progress on product and process roadmaps. With our new operating model firmly in place, we are accelerating actions to improve profitability and capital efficiency by more than $10 billion in 2025, which I will discuss shortly. For the quarter, we delivered sequential revenue growth in line with our forecast, despite the unexpected timing of new export control restrictions announced in May. Q2 profitability was below our expectations, due in part by our decision to more quickly ramp Core Ultra AI CPUs as well as other selective actions we took to better position ourselves for future quarters, which Dave will address fully in his comments.\nWe previously signaled that our investments to define and drive the AI PC category would pressure margins in the near term. We believe the trade offs are worth it. The AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026. We know today's investments will accelerate, extend our leadership, and drive significant benefits in the years to come. Our efforts will culminate with the introduction of Panther Lake in H2 2025. Panther Lake is our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a much more performant and cost competitive process which will additionally allow us to bring more of our tiles in house, meaningfully improving our overall profitability. Another important driver of improved financial performance is the cost reduction plan we announced today.\nThis plan represents structural improvements enabled by our new operating model which we are pulling forward to adjust to current business trends. Having separate financial reporting for Intel products and Intel Foundry clarifies and focuses roles and responsibilities across the company. It also enables us to eliminate complexity and maximize the impact of our resources. Taking a clean sheet view of the business is allowing us to take swift and broad-based actions beginning this quarter. As a result, we expect to drive a meaningful reduction in our spending and headcount beginning in the second half of this year. We are targeting a headcount reduction of greater than 15% by the end of 2025, with the majority of this action completed by the end of this year. We do not take this lightly and we have carefully considered the impact this will have on the Intel family.\nThese are hard but necessary decisions. Our actions will reduce OpEx to approximately $20 billion in 2024 and we see a bigger impact next year with 2025 OpEx targeted at $17.5 billion, more than 20% below prior estimates. We expect further benefits in 2026 with OpEx to decline in absolute dollars yet again. Even as we lower overall spending, we will continue to fund the investments needed to deliver our strategy.\nOur new operating model is also driving benefits to our capital requirements, giving us the transparency to more rigorously scrutinize every project and every dollar of capital. As a result, we now expect gross CapEx in 2024 to be between $25 and 27 billion. That is a reduction of over 20% from our plan entering the year and additionally reflects expectations for softer second half demand. Combined with strong execution of our Smart Capital strategy. Including our second SCIP with Apollo, we expect net capital spending in 2024 will be between $11 and 13 billion. These benefits will carry forward to next year as well. For 2025, gross capital spending is targeted between $20 and 23 billion and net capital spending between $12 to 14 billion.\nIncreased capital efficiency as a positive impact to gross margins over time, but we will also accelerate improvements by generating roughly 1 billion of savings in non-variable cost of sales in 2025. Once again, these reductions do not impact our ability to execute our plan. We designed our Smart Capital strategy to enable us to conservatively manage the day-to-day business to trendline growth while maintaining the operational flexibility to quickly and cost-effectively capture upside when it comes. We are taking the bold step of suspending the dividend at the beginning of Q4. Recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy, we reiterate our long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels.\nReductions across OpEx, CapEx, and cost of sales total well over $10 billion in direct savings in 2025 and provides clear line of sight to a sustainable model with the ongoing financial resources and liquidity needed to support our long-term strategy. We remain confident that we have and will continue to make the investments needed to drive long-term shareholder value, and we view cost discipline as the compass that drives effective execution, helping teams stay on track to both prioritize and achieve measurable results. The operational and capital improvements we are driving will be especially important as we manage the business through the near term. While we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth through the rest of the year, the pace of the recovery will be slower than expected, which is reflected in our Q3 outlook.\nSpecifically, Q3 will be impacted by a modest inventory digestion in CCG with DCAI and our more cyclical businesses of nex, Altera, and Mobileye trending below our original forecast. Our outlook reflects industry-wide conditions without any meaningful change in our market share expectations. As we look into Q4, normal seasonal revenue growth has historically been in a range of flat to up 5% quarter on quarter, with improved client inventory levels exiting Q3. We see Q4 revenue at the high end of that range. Let me now provide more details by our key business units starting with Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership with our aggressive five nodes and four year March, and the finish line is officially within sight.\nWe are well into the ramp of Intel 4, Intel 3, and Intel 20A is being ready for production next quarter on Intel 18A. We released the 1.0 PDK last month and are on track to be manufacturing ready by the end of this year, with production wafer start volumes in H1 2025. Lunar Lake for client is now running Windows and looking very healthy. This is the first microprocessor to use RibbonFET, PowerVia, and advanced packaging, achieving a significant milestone. Clearwater Forest processor, which also includes Foveros Direct and other key advanced packaging capabilities, is booted and likewise looking very healthy. These are the first of many Intel 18A products on track to bring Intel 18A to the mass market.\nImportantly, the launch of 18A will be our fifth node in four years, completing an historic pace of design and process innovation, and returning Intel to process leadership. Our team is resolute and determined to finish what we started, and once we do, it will unlock further growth and value creation across our foundry and product businesses. Our investments in a global footprint of leading-edge capacity continue to weigh on near-term profitability, but long-term, they position us to profitably participate in the largest and fastest-growing parts of the semiconductor market. We continue to expect the investments we're driving through this year to put us on a course for meaningful financial traction, with operating profits for Intel Foundry troughing in 2024, and then driving to break even.\nTo help accelerate our foundry services business. Kevin has led large foundry and fabless businesses outside Intel and is a great addition to our leadership team. He has hit the ground running spending considerable time with current and future foundry customers as we ramp our process, packaging, and chiplet capabilities for the AI era. We are also pleased to welcome Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron later this month to lead our foundry manufacturing and supply chain organization. He brings more than 20 years of leadership in deep technical R&D and manufacturing expertise that will help advance our priorities. Overall, our foundry team is driving excellent collaboration with our design ecosystem partners in Q2. ANSYS, Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys all announced the availability of reference flows for Intel's embedded multi-die interconnect bridge advanced packaging technology.\nEMIB makes it possible to cost-effectively scale to a larger silicon area by connecting multiple die in a single package, which simplifies the design process and offers design flexibility. These same partners also declared readiness for Intel 18A designs, and we will be collaborating closely with the ecosystem in the second half to prepare for next year's 18A launches. Beyond Intel 18A, we are well on our way to Intel 14A and Intel 10A development. Even as we continue to extend leadership and innovation in our process roadmap, we are transitioning to a more normal cadence of node development. The normalized cadence will have positive implications for both pace and magnitude of ongoing R&D, and capital spending requirements. Let's now turn to Intel products in our largest and most profitable business, CCG. We continue to strengthen our position and execute well against our roadmap.\nThe AI PC category is transforming every aspect of the compute experience, and Intel is at the forefront of this category-creating moment. Intel Core Ultra volume more than doubled sequentially in Q2 and is already powering AI capabilities across more than 300 applications and 500 AI models. This is an ongoing testament to the strong ecosystem we have nurtured through 40 years of consistent investments. We have now shipped more than 15 million Windows AI PCs since our December launch, multiples more than all of our competitors combined, and we remain on track to ship more than 40 million AI PCs by year-end and over 100 million cumulative by the end of 2025. Lunar Lake, our next-generation AI PC which achieved production release ahead of schedule in July, will be the next industry-wide catalyst for device refresh.\nLunar Lake delivers superior performance at half the power with 50% better graphics performance and 40% more power efficiency versus the prior generation. Lunar Lake delivers 3x more TOPS gen on gen with our enhanced NPU and will be the ultimate AI CPU on the shelf for the holiday cycle. Microsoft has qualified Lunar Lake to power more than 80 new Copilot+ PCs across more than 20 OEMs, which will begin to ship this quarter.\nLunar Lake will quickly be joined by Arrow Lake which will scale AI to the desktop category next quarter. And as mentioned earlier, we are already gearing up to launch Panther Lake next year to further extend our leadership position. So very good progress in CCG and a super strong roadmap over the next 18 months. Let me now turn to DCAI. This is one of the most important areas of focus as we work to improve our performance and market position. We have a strong foundation on which to build, including the more than 130 million Xeons powering data centers around the world today, and our roadmap is designed to build upon this vast installed base to deliver greater performance and efficiency, enable AI solutions that are open, flexible, and scalable, and reduce total cost of ownership for customers.\nWe took some important steps forward this quarter, starting with the launch of Xeon 6 with E-core processors, formerly code-named Sierra Forest. This is our first Intel 3 product and is particularly well suited for high density scale out workloads. It drives performance up, power down, and dramatic rack consolidation. Early adopters are already seeing 25% better performance per watt versus competitive solutions. This will be followed by Xeon 6 with P-core codenamed Granite Rapids, which delivers greater performance for the most demanding workloads and will begin shipping this quarter. Looking to the future, we are excited about the launch of Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A, a server product featuring our industry-leading hybrid bonding. Clearwater Forest has achieved power-on and is on track to launch in 2025. As we reestablish Xeon's competitive position, we are strongly positioned as the head node of choice in AI servers.\nWe are also focused on improving our accelerator roadmap. We're delivering a combination of performance, flexibility and value that is very compelling to customers, particularly cloud and enterprises seeking scalable cost effective gen AI solutions. Our focus on open models, open developer frameworks and reference designs combining Xeon with accelerators through OPEA or Open Platform for Enterprise AI are gaining considerable market traction. Launching in Q3, Gaudi 3 will take our accelerator performance to the next level at just 2/3 the cost of competitive offerings. To put it into perspective, we expect Gaudi 3 to deliver roughly 2x performance per dollar on both inference and training versus H100. Gaudi 3 has strong ecosystem support including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Foxconn, GIGABYTE, Inventec, Quanta Cloud Technology and Wistron.\nTurning to NEX, we continue to see stability in Q2 while introducing new products that will expand our leadership in edge and networking into the future. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, we announced an array of AI-optimized scale-out Ethernet solutions including the Intel AI Network Interface Card and Foundry chiplets which will launch next year. A recent IPU adapter for the enterprise, supported by Dell Technologies and Red Hat, broadens access to the solution co-developed with Google Cloud. We expect the IPU to be accretive to growth and profitability as it becomes an increasingly important part of acceleration in the AI data center. We also announced the creation of Ultra Accelerator Link, a new industry standard dedicated to advancing high-speed, low-latency communication for scale-up AI systems, communication, and data centers.\nCombined with a growing number of use cases of AI on the edge, NEX is well positioned to be an accretive growth driver in 2025 and beyond. Lastly, as Altera reaches full operational separation by year end, we are actively working toward capitalizing the business to generate proceeds for Intel on a path to an IPO in the coming years. We are excited to provide Altera with the mandate, focus, and resources to realize their growth opportunities and execute their strategy. We expect their increased autonomy will help to drive value for our shareholders similar to the decisions we made with Mobileye two years ago and IMS last year. Before I turn to Dave, let me sum up by saying it has been a hard fought first half of the year.\nWe have achieved several important milestones and we are taking clear and decisive actions to improve our sustainable financial performance. We have entered Q3 with a very clear focus and renewed intensity to up our game and are motivated by the progress we are seeing as we execute our strategy and realize our vision. That is the mindset driving us forward as we continue to build a stronger Intel. With that, I'll pass it over to Dave.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down 1% year over year and up 1% sequentially. Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction, which negatively impacted our client business in China. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered 4% year over year growth, offset by headwinds in our more cyclical businesses. Profitability was significantly more challenged versus our previous expectations with Q2 gross margin of 38.7%. EPS of $0.02, weaker than expected. Gross margin was due to three main drivers. The largest impact was caused by an accelerated ramp of our AI PC product.\nIn addition to exceeding expectations on Q2 core Ultra shipments. We made the decision to accelerate transition of Intel 4 and 3 wafers from our development fab in Oregon to our high volume facility in Ireland, where wafer costs are higher in the near term. However, this change resulted in approximately $1 billion of capital savings and will improve Intel 4 and 3 gross margin long-term. As we scale up the Ireland Fab, margins were also impacted by higher-than-typical period charges related to non-core businesses and charges associated with unused capacity. Finally, we saw an unfavorable product mix and more competitive pricing than expected. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, up approximately $3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital.\nGross CapEx of $5.7 billion was more than offset by $11.5 billion in grants and partner contributions, highlighted by Apollo's SCIP investment in our Ireland factory operations, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion.\nIntel products revenue was $11.8 billion, up 4% year over year. The client business grew 9% year over year as the AI PC ramp contributed to higher volume and ASPs partially offset by export license restrictions communicated during the quarter.\nDCAI revenue was roughly flat sequentially and down three points year over year. We expect sequential growth in the data center through the second half as demand for traditional servers improves modestly. Revenue for the NEX business was approximately flat both sequentially and year over year, though excluding the previously discussed inventory digestion impacting the telco market, NEX delivered 10% year over year growth in the first half.\nQ2 operating profit for Intel products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue, and up approximately $400 million year over year on higher revenue and reduced inventory reserves.\nIntel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1 point sequentially and up 4% year over year driven by increased wafer volume on Intel 7 and our first EUV nodes. Intel 4 and 3 foundry services revenue more than doubled sequentially off a small base, including the start of advanced packaging revenue.\nFoundry operating loss of $2.8 billion was worse sequentially. We expect operating losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q3, with more than 85% of wafer volume still coming from pre-EUV nodes with an uncompetitive cost structure and power, performance, and area deficits reflected in market-based pricing. The continued ramp of our Intel 4 and 3 Ireland facility and elevated R&D and startup costs to support the rapid progression of our leading-edge technology development will also weigh on profitability.\nMobileye revenue of $440 million improved 84% sequentially due to non-recurrence of the significant inventory drawdown that occurred in Q1. The rapid revenue and margin recovery indicates digestion occurred in an organized, predictable fashion, and we believe it is now complete. However, difficult conditions in China, which are impacting many western automotive suppliers, led Mobileye to lower their revenue and income guidance for the second half.\nAltera delivered revenue of $361 million, up 6% sequentially with operating margins improving 4 points in the quarter. Revenue remains below consumption as inventory positions tied to previous supply constraints are worked down. We expect double digit sequential revenue growth through the second half as customers return to more normal buying patterns.\nNow turning to our Q3 guidance. Weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, and continued focus on AI server investments in the cloud have reduced our TAM expectations for 2024. As a result, customer inventory levels are elevated. We expect customers to reduce inventory over the second half of the year, along with the continued modest negative impact from export controls. These market dynamics should result in below seasonal revenue growth in Q3, with the client business flat to down and modest growth in data center and edge markets. With an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and the continuation of an enterprise refresh cycle, we should see revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter.\nWe expect gross margins to be moderately weaker sequentially with modest revenue growth and efficiencies offset by a continued ramp of new manufacturing nodes. While we will continue our work to improve near-term profitability, a heavier dependence on external wafers as we ramp AI PC products over the next several quarters will pressure gross margins.\nAs a result of these factors, we expect revenue of $12.5 to 13.5 billion in Q3. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 38% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.03, all on a non-GAAP basis. As Pat discussed earlier, lower than anticipated revenue in the back half of the year is putting pressure on gross margins and earnings. We are taking aggressive actions to significantly reduce spending in response.\nThese actions, while difficult, will help streamline the organization to improve productivity and make better decisions more quickly. Please note that we are likely to have charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance. Smart Capital continues to guide the pace and breadth of our global capacity expansion, and our new operating model has uncovered opportunities to build and utilize manufacturing capacity more efficiently. Additionally, we've responded to lower revenue by reducing 2024 gross capital investments to a range of $25 to $27 billion with a net capital spending of $11 to $13 billion, including our SCIP programs.\nThese adjustments ordinarily would bring us back to approximately breakeven adjusted free cash flow, but we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be modestly negative as we make payments related to the restructuring charges and necessary to achieve our spending targets in 2025. With OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and net CapEx of $12 to $14 billion, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. The suspension of the dividend, initial Altera capitalization, and positive adjusted free cash flow should significantly improve our liquidity in 2025 and position us to begin the process of meaningfully decreasing our leverage.\nBefore I close, let me take a moment to highlight a couple items as you model 2025. As previously mentioned, we expect operating expenses to be reduced from street expectations of $21 billion to approximately $17.5 billion. We will also reduce spending within non-variable cost of sales by approximately $1 billion.\nWhile that will obviously have a positive impact on gross margins, we still only expect a roughly 60% fall through for gross margin next year. The AI PC is a big winner for the company, and the early signals on the performance of Lunar Lake are very positive. We therefore intend to ramp that product significantly next year to meet market demand. While the part is great, it was originally a narrowly targeted product using largely external wafers and not optimized for cost. As a result, our gross margins will likely be up only modestly next year. The good news is the follow-on product Panther Lake is internally sourced on Intel 18A and has a much improved cost structure as the momentum of AI PCs drives Panther Lake demand.\nTogether with the improvements from our new operating model and the cost savings from our lower capital spending, we will be in a great position to see meaningful gross margin expansion subsequent years. Lastly, the non-controlling income from Mobileye, Altera, and IMS and the portion of the SCIP earned by our partners show up on a line below net income called non-controlling interest. The NCI adjustment has been negligible so far, but we expect it to be a more meaningful driver, reducing our controlled share of income by approximately $700 million on a GAAP basis in 2025 and increasing as wafer production at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland increases in subsequent years.\nIn closing, the market has not recovered as expected, and we're obviously not satisfied with our results. We're responding by aggressively adjusting 2025 spending to achieve profitability and positive adjusted free cash flow that is commensurate with the current market conditions while continuing to invest in and execute our strategy. In addition to these near-term actions, we're also seeing meaningful opportunities to improve financial results leveraging our new operating model. We remain optimistic that reduced spending, operating efficiencies, and more competitive products will keep us on track to our target model at 60% gross margin and 40% operating margin by the end of the decade. I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q and A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where appropriate. With that, Jon, can we please take the first caller?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question, Pat. Big picture, are the challenges a product issue, a market issue, strategic issue, execution issue? I'm just wondering, have the core issues been accurately diagnosed? Because when we look at your CPU competitor, they appear to be doing much better in this same environment. So I'm curious, what is plan B if just cost cuts don't do the job?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, Vivek. To start out, we'd say that this first phase of the recovery, restoration, and rebuilding plan is now well underway. With 18A PDK 1.0 with Panther Lake, Clearwater Forest powered on, our geo footprint now starting to take shape, we have more competitive products in every segment of the industry. That said, with that foundation in place, it's time for us to focus on phase two, building a more financially sustainable model for the company for the future. Many of the new products are yet to ramp into the marketplace, and we're just now getting to competitiveness. But we need to build a more sustainable business model for us that allows us to have the financial wherewithal for the long term journey. I'd say this rebuilding that we're underway, this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel since the transition from memory to microprocessors four decades ago.\nWe firmly believe in the IDM 2.0 strategy. We're building two world class companies. The forensics that we've done this year, this clean sheet exercise, as we could describe it, is building a world class Intel foundry and building a world class Intel products group. You know, these efforts we believe have identified many opportunities for us to have, you know, financial savings. We've launched those aggressive steps today and we believe that with the new products, a better financial position that we've done for a more efficient operation, that we see the long term opportunity for significant value creation for all of our stakeholders.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nVivek, do you have a follow-up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you John, for my follow-up. I'm curious, what impact do the restrictions, sorry the restructuring actions have on either your R&D roadmap, your long-term external foundry opportunity, and any CHIPS Act funding? I think in the past you had suggested about 15 billion in long-term value from external foundry. Is there any impact on those growth targets because of the restructuring action? Just what changes with these restructuring actions? Thank you.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you, Vivek. And fundamentally we believe our strategy will be maintained even as we get these more efficient steps in place. The CHIPS grants, taking your questions one by one on the CHIPS side, these are milestone-based investments. We still believe that we're comfortably able to execute against those milestones across the projects that we've announced. So we believe very comfortably that the CHIPS model that we've put in place. We've worked closely with the CHIPS Program Office and the US Government. We're very comfortable on those plans. Also the Foundry, we're seeing a lot of momentum in areas like the advanced packaging areas where we're actually seeing quite a lot of uptake and expansion of those opportunities.\nSo the $15 billion of LDV that we've talked about and the $15 billion revenue by the end of the decade, we're very confident that those are still very solid guidelines for us to be building to. Obviously, with the capital changes that we've made, we're going to be driving, just like a world class foundry does, to be much more efficient with our capital investments and scrutinizing them more carefully. And now that we've paid the capital to catch up this catch up capital, we had no spare capacity, we had no slack ahead, we had no capacity to catch up.\nAs those investments are now largely completed, we're able to focus much more on capital efficiency for the future and aligning our capital spend to the market signals as we see to the future of our products as well as the foundry, you know, commitments that we have in place. You know, finally I'll just say again, you know, we're building this against the market outlook. We're going to flex our investments, you know, up and down appropriately. And we've now established the model with our Smart Capital to have that effectiveness that we can scale up and down, you know, to market conditions. So we feel like all of the things that we said for our strategy on track and we're now moving into phase two of the execution of that strategy.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Vivek. Jon, can we have the next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Kind of want to follow up on the first two. Pat, maybe just ask it a different way. Part of what you're saying, it sounds like you're adjusting your spending across the board to reflect the macro reality, slower growth, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut it seems like that would be difficult to do if it didn't impact any of the structural dynamics as well. So I guess the real question is, are there any changes either to your competitiveness, the structure of the company, the long term $100 billion target that you just saw weren't happening, and therefore felt these cuts were necessary? So do any of the structural changes or can you describe any of the structural changes and what the outcome to your financial targets might be?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation",
    "content3": "Yeah. Let me point you back to what I said at the start. We started this forensics, this clean sheet analysis concurrent with the rolling out of our new operational model. We said we have to be a world class foundry. We are going to benchmark ourselves against world class foundries. And that's what Intel Foundry is going to become. And that's uncovered a lot of things, a lot of inefficiencies, a lot of ways that we can drive our capital footprint more effectively. Every aspect of that business is being analyzed and how we do maintenance, how we procure chemicals, how we run and price wafers and shuttle lots, and everything like that. So clean sheet analysis. Similarly, on the product side, we've done exactly that same analysis. What does a world class fabless company look like?\nWe uncover quite a lot of areas where we don't leverage industry IPs. We're not using our EDA vendors as effectively. We've done too many steppings. We validate versus build in design quality. So many of these things are steps that we're taking to be a world-class fabless company. And these are significant structural steps. We also realize that as an IDM 1.0, we were never built for efficiency, we were built for leadership. Now as we add this focus on efficiency, we see a lot of opportunities. I'm having each of the four business areas, client, networking, and data center, look at their own portfolios, even though those are the right product areas for us for the future. Similarly, the portfolio of our Intel Foundry business.\nThat's the work that we've now been undertaking and we're now accelerating based on the less than expected quarterly results. We're accelerating those impacts. We're going to drive that in the second half of this year. We want to get these restructurings done quickly so that we can move forward more aggressively with the product lines next year. In terms of the long-term forecast, we're clearly tempering our view of how fast we can grow in the near term based on the market conditions.\nBut our model is built that we will scale up or scale down the capital requirements appropriate to the market conditions we see. We believe the long-term guides that we've given you, the 60, 40, you know, getting to the foundry business model we've described, the growth areas that we've said, you know, as those are larger portions of our business, we believe those are long-term, still achievable in that regard. And we're on track, you know, for many of those things in the models that we're laying out. And today's actions will help accelerate its.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, I do. Dave, you went through with good details the cost structure and what would change the puts and takes for next year. I wondered, I know you're not going to guide to 2025 revenue, but the puts and takes from maybe a competitive positioning point of view, how you're feeling in CCG, DCAI primarily relative to the competition, any sort of tailwind, headwind analysis, or description for 25 would be helpful.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, sure. On the client side, you know, obviously we feel very good given our AI PC position. We're, we're leading that, that new product category, and you know, I think we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about Lunar Lake, our next product coming in after Meteor Lake and the performance of that. So that looks like a phenomenally good product and position. You know, we're making the early inroads on the AI side of data center, and that's only going to grow as we go into next year.\nYou know, the big question is when does the kind of traditional CPU market recover? You know, it has been tempered this year, and you know, of course affected by other regions of the world like China spending and so forth. You know, that's obviously been a soft space, and so we'll have to see how that plays out. And then network obviously also outside of the telco space is starting to recover, and then we have these other businesses. Altera is starting to recover now. So we're optimistic that next year will be a good year for them. We'll have to see how Mobileye plays out ultimately.\nI think on the margin front, I talked about our tempered view of gross margins next year given the ramp of Lunar Lake, which, with memory and package, and almost all of the material getting sourced outside, and we're seeing inflation in that space that is impacting it. But that part is followed by Panther Lake that comes back into the fab. I think one of the bigger stories we'll have once we get beyond next year is kind of the resurgence of our internal facilities to start taking on a lot of the capacity that we had to move into.\nExternal sources should provide some meaningful improvement in terms of profitability. Then of course, we've done a lot, as Pat talked about, in terms of restructuring the business, and those will start to show up next year, but will be even more impactful the following year, including the new operating model. So I think the good news for us is we actually don't need a ton of growth to see our model play out both in the kind of medium term and long term in terms of gross margins and operating margins. And if we do get the growth, it puts us in even better position.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, thank you for taking the question. I guess, Dave, a follow-up to that prior question was hoping you could perhaps speak to, you know, how to think about gross margins beyond 25. You know, it's obviously very hard to offer the leverage when you're investing in both foundry capacity and at the same time outsourcing meaningful tiles to TSMC. So encouraging that you're bringing Panther Lake back in-house. How should we think about incremental margins there and any of the other kind of moving parts that you've been speaking about on this call, including the unfavorable product mix and the more competitive pricing. Is that just a near-term kind of phenomenon or something else we should be thinking about, you know, into 2025, 2026.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, yeah. So as I talked about to Ross, CJ, you know, the good news for 2026 for us is that that really begins the shift back to the internal manufacturing footprint for a lot of our tiles. And, and so bringing back more wafers to the internal network will meaningfully improve the cost structure. You know, I think the adjustments in CapEx, which are clearly helpful in terms of cash flow in the near term, become really beneficial to the cost structure as depreciation becomes kind of a less of a headwind for us. So that will also be helpful. And then like I said, you know, we've got all these structural improvements that are coming our way both from the actions we've taken today, but the new operating model and decisions will get made on a go forward basis that will just optimize our business model going forward.\nI think 2026 should be a good year for us in terms of gross margins. We'll save the actual number for a later date when we have more visibility into how things are playing out. I think from a mix perspective, you know, it's probably not going to be a big, you know, headwind or tailwind for us. Just, you know, strict mix other than, you know, as we move towards more leading-edge wafers, the margins on those wafers are significantly better than the, you know, the margins in pre-EUV nodes. So that will, that will be one factor that will certainly help us. It also, you know, in that regard, that also helps on the pricing side because obviously from a wafer perspective, we get better pricing on EUV wafers as opposed to pre-EUV wafers.\nAnd then ultimately, I think on pricing, you know, it will really come down to when we have a competitive process and we have competitive products running on a competitive process and we're delivering what the customers want. That helps us in terms of the pricing dynamic. And, you know, we're getting to the place, as Pat talked about, where we're starting to deliver on all those fronts. And so I feel good about our opportunity to realize that in the form of pricing as we progress through the next few years.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nJust one thing to add on top of that, just to be, to clarify, with Panther Lake already powered on. Right. And showing good health, you know, that is a product that we start ramping in the second half of next year. Right. So, you know, we'll start to see some of those benefits, but obviously the huge volume benefits of that really are in 2026, where we'll be very aggressive at bringing both the wafers home on a more competitive process with a more competitive product with Panther Lake offsetting the volumes of Lunar Lake, which is almost entirely outsourced. So we bring Tiles home with a more competitive product and a more competitive process. And that really is, I'll say, the story, you know, that will start to unfold as we talk to you more next year.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nCJ, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, just a quick one. On OpEx, you gave us the 175 for all of calendar 2025, but could you share with us what you think the exit rate would look like? I'm coming to around $4.25 billion. Is that in the ballpark?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I'll say. Given that some of the actions we're taking will kind of go through at least the early part of next year, we're going to enter at a higher number than we're going to exit, I'll give you that. And we should be down in 2026 relative to 2025. Give me some time as we progress through the year to start to fine-tune the budget for 2026, and I'll give you more clarity around that.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, CJ. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. You talked about the server roadmap with Sierra Forest shipping and Granite Rapids shipping this quarter. Can you talk about, you know, how that, where that puts you competitively? Do you think you're kind of have closed the gap or is a leadership product, and you know, obviously Clearwater Forest is the, is the longer term focus, but where are we in the interim?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you. And obviously, you know, Sierra Forest, right. E-core product, very efficient, but a new category for us. So we have to go win sockets with it. Early customer feedback, very positive, as we said, greater than 25% TCO value that they're seeing from it. But it's early in its ramp. Granite Rapids is really the P-core, I'll say the more traditional Xeon for us and we'll start that ramp this quarter, but it will take us anything in the server market, you know, winning back share, winning back sockets is a longer term cycle for that. But a lot of encouraging signs for Granite Rapids, even though a lot of the data center energy right now is on the AI buildout, as you know.\nSo in this environment, you know, we're largely facing a period where much of the investment energy is going into the AI footprint. So we're having to fight to win those sockets back. But Granite Rapids looks very positive. The early health of Clearwater Forest is really spectacular. This is a really stunning technical achievement with the new design 18A. This level of health this early in a major server product is really spectacular. The new Foveros Direct and should have substantial TCO benefits for next year. And then the next P-core version of that on 18A is also showing very good, not in fab yet, but showing very good design progress. So we feel like the roadmap gets more competitive and with it, we believe our market share position is fairly, I'll say, static right year on year.\nWe do see that overall the ARM market share is more modest in the second half this year. So the x86 share, and we're stabilizing our overall position in the marketplace. We believe as we then go to fight to win back. One of the good things that we've seen for our server market is the AI head nodes where we're quite advantaged. And we're seeing a lot of interest in Xeon being the head node of choice for anybody's accelerator, you know, including ours. So a lot of things to unpack there. But we do feel like our position is stabilizing and strengthening with our products, and the roadmap only improves from here.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a follow-up?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, just on the notion that AI has kind of stolen some of the focus from server. It seemed like we would be looking at a ceiling in overall our budgets in a couple of years. That would mean we need to invest in traditional server ecosystems and maybe do a significant refresh. You know, do you see any indications of that? And given that, you know, I perceive you guys are sort of stronger in enterprise than in cloud right now. Like, how are you positioned to take advantage of that when it does come?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Joe. We do think that the enterprise market, right, is a more favorable market for us. We do have some early indications of positive cycle there. But I'll say it's too early to give you any real firm indications. We are starting to see, I'll say, better buying behavior, better signals from our OEMs in the enterprise market. Similarly for the cloud market, we do believe there will be a refresh cycle, right, as people get their AI strategies in place. The TCO benefits of a server refresh. Now as we start talking about 3x-4x consolidation ratios that they can have on their traditional cloud environments, their container delivery environments, these are quite substantial.\nWe do believe that as our products get to be more competitive and there is a natural refresh cycle on that, the markets will be more favorable for the traditional CPU market. But of course the story is CPU plus GPU and that's the bigger message that we'll be delivering. And obviously as Gaudi 3 starts shipping, you know, the CPU plus GPU use cases like we've described with OPEA, you know, that will also help us for positioning on both sides of the cloud and the enterprise market for both CPU and GPU. That's the strategy that we're building toward.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nSure. Thanks. Dave, can you again explain how June gross margin was so much worse than you thought just three months ago? I mean, revenue is basically in line. I know you talked about mix, but it seems like it was probably a pretty small part of it. Mix was. And it was really more the decisions around Intel 4 and 3. So can you just explain again. I'm not sure I understand why that was such a big.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, okay. That was the biggest one. Let me. I'll just say that there were a couple other things that we had to do. Some write-offs related to legacy businesses that impacted us. Our utilization was a bit lower. That did impact us. But the biggest one was the shift. We were originally planning to ramp Meteor Lake, Intel 3, and even, you know, run production on Intel 4 or, sorry, Intel 4, and then run production on Intel 3 in Oregon, which is our TD fab, our process technology fab, kind of our development fab. We made the decision to more quickly shift all of that over to Ireland. And it's a good move because it saves capital. We don't have to spend capital twice, essentially, and it starts to mature the Intel 4 and 3 processes in Ireland more quickly.\nThe downside of that is the wafers are expensive right now. So we get this kind of early ramp of the product at a much higher wafer cost that we're pushing through the system. And that puts pressure on the margins that's going to carry into next quarter. I mean, we will do better in next quarter, obviously, but we're going to do more volume and the margins will be, you know, below the corporate average because of. Because while we're improving the wafer cost, you know, it's still not to the point where it's above corporate average yet. And so it will weigh down on margins for the third quarter as well. After that, you know, it gets more and more mature, the cost structure gets better and the situation on Lunar Lake will improve meaningfully.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nYeah. Pat, can you just talk about the foundry strategy given the CapEx cut? I guess my question is how you sort of execute on the plan with this lower CapEx? I mean, kind of on one hand we keep talking about bringing all these wafers back in house to help gross margin in 2026. But I also hear about a lot more outsourcing to TSMC, even in real time. So is the cut more that some of your foundry customers are maybe structurally deciding that they're not as committed? I'm just trying to understand how you can cut CapEx and still execute on the foundry strategy. Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you. And at the highest level, the foundry strategy unchanged and we've built capacity corridor for foundry customers. However, until we have committed orders, we're going to be modest on how much equipment we put against the shells and the sites that we have in place, and how much of that corridor we keep available. How much flexibility, working with our equipment suppliers that we need, you know, for that will be a subject of careful scrutiny as we go forward. You know, we've also made some adjustments in the capital investment that we need to support our current view of market forecasts. So all of those are, say, adjustments. The big thing is now that we're finishing this phase of aggressive build out, and as you think about what we had to catch up, we had no EUV capacity, we had no shell-ahead, site-ahead capacity. We had no capacity to pull tiles home as those come into place.\nWe've been making substantial capital investments over the last couple of years, and now we're focused on how do we harvest those investments in 2024, 2025, and 2026. So we're putting a much more aggressive view of capital utilization. Right. How much capital required ahead working with the suppliers to be more efficient in our capital dollars just like a foundry does. And for that we'll point you back to it again, right? We're going to be a world-class fabless company, Intel Products. We're going to be a world-class foundry with Intel Foundry. The last point I'd make here on this is a lot of the early success that we're having with foundry customers is advanced packaging, and there the capital requirements are not as significant as required for wafer capacity. So we believe very much that we're seeing a surge of interest there.\nYou know, customers in advanced packaging are clearly interested in us for capacity but increasingly for our most advanced packaging technology. So that's an area that we believe we have, as we described before as the on ramp for Intel Foundry and that's continuing to look very good. The final point is the Intel Foundry capacity will be aligned with, to the first order, the Intel product requirements. And clearly as a lot of tiles externally in 2025, we bring those home in 2026, that's when we'll start to really, as Dave said, see the benefits of the model that we've put in place. Tiles coming home leadership process technology leadership products starts in 2025, deliver big time in 2026 and beyond.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next caller please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you. Couple of follow-ups. Dave, on the move from Oregon to Ireland Fab. You talked about that being a gross margin headwind. Can you talk about how much? Can you clarify how much of a headwind that is right now and also, you know, when it's fully loaded on a like-for-like basis? How much of a headwind do you think that's going to be on an ongoing basis?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI'm sorry, the second question is how much will the headwind be on an ongoing basis?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nOn an ongoing basis is what you're saying.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nOngoing basis. Yeah.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nOkay. All right, so I think the best way to think about it is, you know, we were, I don't know, 400 basis points or so off on the gross margin. Take into account revenue was part of it. You know, it was a meaningful chunk of that 400 basis points. There was the write-offs rate related to legacy businesses and the you know, mix and under utilization also affected it, and it wasn't an insignificant amount, but that was a good portion of that 400 basis points, let's call it that. That will be the case in the third quarter probably given the, you know, increase. I think we're talking about a 50% increase in Meteor Lake quarter over quarter in the, in the third quarter. Beyond that it's going to start to become less and less to the point where it's, you know, actually not going to be a headwind.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, it becomes a tailwind. Exactly as the Ireland factory ramps, a production factory will have a lower cost per wafer start than a TD factory like Oregon. So it becomes a headwind as we go into next year tailwind as we go.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nNow as we know, the challenge for next year will now be ramping Lunar Lake next year. Lunar Lake has the memory in the package, so we're going to have to essentially buy that at a price and turn around and include that in our price at 0% margin. So that puts some negative pressure on the margins, and additionally it's got more of the content sourced externally, and as you know we're seeing some inflation. So that one then becomes more of a hit. Meteor Lake starts to be helpful, but Lunar Lake starts to become a drag on the Intel products margins, which is why we were tempered in terms of our outlook for margins next year because we're going to have a lot of improvements on the Intel foundry side.\nIt's going to be tempered on the product side, and it's really going to because of Lunar Lake.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nI was just going to add one thing. As we move the Intel 4 and 3 capacity into Ireland, it also gives our TD team more focus on their CapEx on 18A as well as then 14A and 10A. You know, we're taking, for instance, the second high-NA tool is coming into our Oregon facility. So we're well underway on 14A. So part of this was a capacity and cost decision for the long term. Part of it was an AI PC acceleration, but it was also a TD cadence decision in optimizing the use of our TD resources, you know, for the next generation technologies which are already well underway and showing good early indicators.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nSrini, do you have a quick follow on?\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nYeah. So, Pat, I think in the past you talked about the foundry business potentially breaking even sometime 2027, and given all the cuts, and you seem to at least sound confident that foundry opportunity is not changing. So, I'm just curious, do you see a possibility that foundry business could actually break even sooner given all the cuts?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYou know, clearly that's our objective for Dave. And I'll say that said, we have a lot of wood to chop until we complete that journey. You know, the steps that we've taken today are significant right ones for our operational efficiency that we're putting in place. So clearly that's our operating objective that we have. But as you said, you know, 2026 is really this year that many of these wafers come home, many of the new factory investments come online, the new process technologies. So I'd say that 2027 timeframe is still a good one. But you can trust that every aspect of what we're doing is to accelerate the profitability. And the significant announcement today of the cost and financial focus will give us, I'll say, the scrutiny and the lens by which to focus our Intel foundry.\n$10 billion next year is a big number, and we expect that many of these operational improvements will carry forward in 2016. Dave said an acceleration of our adjusted free cash flow turning positive. So everything that we're doing is aligned with that thought. Srini.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Srini. Jonathan, we've got time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsey from TD Cowen. Your question please.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you, guys.\nI guess my first question is on the client space. I think Dave, you might have mentioned client flat to down in September. I think your primary x86 competitor is going to be up double digits or I think they mentioned above seasonal. However you quantify seasonal. Now, maybe you could give us a little color there. There's lots of, maybe, noise in the system about ARM coming into the client market. I think that impact would be more. Modest relative to what you described.\nBut if you could kind of give us puts and takes there and how the inventory with OEMs might be affecting what you're guiding for this September? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I'll take that, Matt. And you know, we feel very good with our client position, the momentum we have in AI PC here, we have a very healthy ecosystem as well. And I'll say as the large market share position that we have, we're very focused on sell in and sell through in the channel. So I believe our overall view of inventory levels where our market share is, we're actually quite comfortable in the indications that we've given, some inventory sell through in the third quarter above seasonal in Q4. Overall, the TAM expansion is low single digit, even though we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm around the AI PC and further TAM expansion as we go into 2025 is expected.\nNow broadly, we'd also say that our position in the commercial portion of this market is very strong with our vPro assets, and we believe we're coming into a refresh cycle on the corporate. We also saw things like vPro have great success for customers as they were dealing with the CrowdStrike blue screen period. And customers who are vPro customers were able to recover in a day or so, where customers not on vPro took weeks to recover from that. So a lot of reinforcement of the ecosystem. The leadership that we have on AI PC and, as Dave said, Lunar Lake and Panther Lake only make our market position stronger. So I think we're very comfortable, and every indication so far this quarter is very solid for those outcomes.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nMatt, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes, I do. Thanks, Jon. I wanted to ask, thinking of some of the prepared script that maybe early in the Q&A, Pat, you kind of reiterated the $15 billion funnel for the foundry business. I know in the medium term a lot of that is packaging, but I wanted to ask about the customers that you've engaged with on 18A and maybe early on 14A. How have you seen the Gantt charts of the programs that they're planning to bring into your foundry? Progress in the last few quarters? Are people still committed to ramping those things? Are they taking PDKs and maybe doing tape ins? Are things moving forward? Have you seen any acceleration? Have you seen hesitation or maybe wait and see from those customers? I'm just trying to figure out how that stuff is progressing on 18A. Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Let me just clarify. The $15 billion is lifetime deal value of committed deal. So this is a pipeline, this is committed business that we now have in place. So I just want to clarify that Matt, because I think your question suggests it's a pipeline. There's a lot more in the pipeline. This is $15 billion of committed deals. As you say, a lot of the near-term opportunity has been advanced packaging, and we're seeing significant expansion of that capability in terms of volume and technology. On 18A specifically, a lot of customers have been waiting for the PDK. Now that we released the PDK last month, the 1.0 PDK, we've seen a flurry of activity with the EDA, the IP vendors, and the end customers. So I'd be optimistic that we have good indicators coming in that area in the future.\nBut this was really the starting point for many of them to go from test chips to start looking at production chips, you know, coming based on the PDK that we've just released. So we remain very comfortable with our earlier comments in that area, and I'd say, you know, we do believe that we'll have further updates there. But as we've also indicated, customers are reluctant to put their name out there, you know, given the supply base and the traditional operation of the foundry industry. Overall, things are looking on track for what we said with a meaningful acceleration in packaging over the last quarter. More updates to come. Maybe with that. John, I'll wrap us up. You know, thank you for joining our call.\nWe appreciate the time as always, and I'd say on a couple of these topics, I hope to see many of you at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference coming up where we'll have some further updates. You know, I want to reiterate in a quarter like this that we are resolved to finish the audacious turnaround, the building of our process and product key milestones that we've achieved of this phase. But now we have to shift to putting more emphasis on the financial sustainability of our business. We're making difficult decisions as we right size, we rebuild a more efficient, leaner, agile Intel for the future and one that we're confident will enable our long-term success. Thanks and good afternoon everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star one one on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star one one again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains reference to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.\nOur earnings release, most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, John, and welcome, everyone. We've reported solid Q1 results, delivering revenue in line and EPS above our guidance as we continue to focus on operating leverage and expense management. Our results reflect our disciplined approach on reducing costs, as well as the steady progress we are making against our long-term priorities. While first-half trends are modestly weaker than we originally anticipated, they are consistent with what others have said and also reflect some of our own near-term supply constraints. We continue to see Q1 as the bottom, and we expect sequential revenue growth to strengthen throughout the year and into 2025, underpinned by one, the beginnings of an enterprise refresh cycle and growing momentum for AI PCs, two, a data center recovery with a return to more normal CPU buying patterns and ramping of our accelerator offerings, and three, cyclical recoveries in NEX, Mobileye, and Altera.\nWe had an extremely productive Q1 and achieved several important milestones along our journey to reposition the company for improved execution, competitiveness, and perhaps most importantly, financial results. We hosted our first-ever Intel Foundry Direct Connect, which drew nearly 300 partners, customers, and potential customers to hear about the momentum we are building with our foundry offerings. We were pleased to announce Microsoft as our fifth Intel 18A customer. We also updated our lifetime deal value to greater than $15 billion and extended our roadmap with Intel 14A, the first process node in the industry to use High NA EUV technology. Shortly following Direct Connect, we were thrilled to join with President Biden and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to announce our position as the national semiconductor champion, along with the single largest award from the CHIPS and Science Act of more than $45 billion of proposed grants, tax incentives, and loans.\nDuring the second week of April, we brought together more than 1,000 of our top customers and partners at Intel Vision 2024, where we introduced our next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator. We were joined by Naver, Dell, Bosch, Supermicro, and Roche, among many others, who shared how they are benefiting from Intel solutions. Vision led straight into Open Source Summit, where we led the launch of the Open Platform for Enterprise AI project. This industry initiative aims to accelerate Gen AI deployments in what will be the largest market for AI applications, starting with retrieval augmented generation, or RAG. Our Xeon plus Gaudi use cases, along with our established enterprise ecosystem, have a big role to play here. Lastly, we hosted the industry's first Sustainability Summit, underscoring our deep commitment to building a more geographically diverse, resilient, trusted, and of course, sustainable supply chain for semiconductors.\nWe are proud of our leadership position in chemical conservation, renewable energy, and water reclamation. Our accomplishments year to date build on all the work we have done to execute on the strategy I laid out when I rejoined the company three years ago. Job number one was to accelerate our efforts to close the technology gap that was created by over a decade of underinvestment. The heart of phase one was five-nodes-in-four-years. The rallying cry was torrid. It combined accelerating our node transitions with improving our product execution and cadence to regain customer trust. We have rebuilt our own culture and execution engine, and are on track to completing our five-nodes-in-four-years goal, which many of our stakeholders thought impossible at inception.\nIn so doing, we are in a unique position with at-scale EUV technology, Western-based capacity, and at the very least, a level playing field with the market leader. Intel 20A, which helps pave the way for Intel 18A, begins production ramp in the second half of this year with Arrow Lake. We expect to release the 1.0 PDK for Intel 18A this quarter. Furthermore, our lead products, Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake, are already in fab, and we expect to begin production ramp of Intel 18A and these products in H1 2025 for product release in the middle of next year. Given this progress, now is the time to turn our focus to matching technology leadership with a competitive cost structure. Establishing a foundry relationship between our products group and our manufacturing group was a critical step to achieve better structural cost.\nThis quarter, we officially transitioned to our new operating model and introduced Intel Products and Intel Foundry. Today, for the first time, we are reporting our results to reflect the new way in which we are running the company. Separating the internal financial reporting between Intel Foundry and Intel Products was a critical step needed to provide transparency, accountability, and the proper incentives to allow both groups to make better decisions to optimize their own cost structures. This change also provided the added benefit of giving more transparency to our outside owners. We knew that the day-one P&L for Intel Foundry was going to spark debate, but we also knew it was important to establish a baseline and provide a target model based on reasonable to conservative revenue and cost assumptions that we have a high degree of confidence we will achieve.\nI want to reiterate that point so it is heard and understood. Our target model is reasonable, conservative, and reflects a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver. You can rest assured that we will be working hard to beat these targets. If we can move faster and do better, we will. Our new operating model is already catalyzing change and driving efficiencies across the organization. Let me highlight three important aspects of our business and our strategy that is underscored by the new model. First, with Intel Products, we have exposed a solid, fabless franchise with established, powerful, and hard-to-displace installed base and ecosystem across enterprise, consumer, and edge that provide meaningful benefits to our customers and partners. Intel Products is a solidly profitable business today, despite just recently emerging from a semiconductor downturn and still competing with legacy process technology.\nThat is changing rapidly as we ramp Intel 3 in 2024 and Intel 18A in 2025. Within Client, we are defining and leading the AI PC category. IDC indicates the overall PC market is now expanding. As stated earlier, as standards emerge and applications begin to take advantage of new AI-embedded capabilities, we see demand signals improving, especially in the second half of the year, helped by a likely corporate refresh. Our Core Ultra ramp, led by Meteor Lake, continues to accelerate beyond our original expectation, with units expected to double sequentially in Q2, limited only by our supply of wafer-level assembly. Improving second-half Meteor Lake supply and the addition of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake later this year will allow us to ship in excess of our original $40 million AI PC CPU target in 2024.\nNext year, with Panther Lake, we will extend our lead with Intel 18A and further product enhancements. Our share position is strong and continues to strengthen as we execute on our product roadmap. Within DCAI, as committed, we have achieved product release on our first Intel 3 server product, the first-generation E-core Xeon 6, codename Sierra Forest. The next-generation P-core Xeon 6 product, Granite Rapids, will be released in Q3. At Vision, we demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Xeon 6 with good performance. We continue to expect share trends to stabilize this year before improving in 2025. While budgets are still being prioritized to generative AI build-out, where we have a strong position in the head node, customer conversations continue to show improving signs for traditional CPU refresh starting in late Q2 and into the second half.\nOur first Intel 18A product, Clearwater Forest, is slated to launch next year and will allow us to accelerate share gains. Our Gaudi 3 launch gave us a strong offering to improve our position in accelerated computing for the data center and cloud. We now expect over $500 million in accelerated revenue in the second half of 2024, with increasing momentum into 2025 based on Gaudi 3's vastly superior TCO, as well as our own expanding supply. In addition, we are finding good traction with the Intel Developer Cloud, with customers onboarding with this platform, including Dell and Seekr, our largest IDC win to date. We are encouraged by our progress, but far from satisfied. Lastly, within NEX, the business has stabilized and beat our Q1 targets, with channel inventories approaching normal levels and business acceleration expected through the year as a result.\nWe also recently announced our plans for scale-up and scale-out Ethernet-based AI networking delivered as a discrete NIC and chiplets for AI Foundry customers, with numerous key providers in the industry and market standardization through the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. So that is Intel Products, good momentum, and a lot for us to build on. Let me turn to Intel Foundry. We are executing on our strategy to drive meaningful improvement and profitability over time. We are obviously not there yet, given the large upfront investment we needed to build out this business, but we always said this was going to be a multi-year plan, and we are right on track with where we expect it to be right now. As we discussed during our webinar at the beginning of the month, the transition from pre-EUV wafers to post-EUV wafers is a powerful tailwind for us.\nWe expect our blended average wafer pricing to grow 3x faster than costs over the decade, driving significant margin expansion. In addition, more competitive wafers will allow us to bring home many of the tiles that today are being manufactured at external foundries. Both dynamics are in our control, and not dependent on revenue growth, and are key elements to drive the business to break even, more than doubling our current earnings power at the Intel consolidated level. Of course, more competitive wafers combined with our position as the only company manufacturing with leading-edge wafers outside of Asia is drawing strong interest from potential external customers. It is important to note that our leadership in advanced packaging creates more value in our wafer technologies, and wafer-level assembly and base-die opportunities further fill our factories and extend the useful life of our tools for increased financial returns.\nI am pleased to announce that this quarter we signed another meaningful customer on Intel 18A, bringing our total to six. A leader in the aerospace and defense industry, this customer chose Intel Foundry based not only on the process technology benefits of Intel 18A, but also because of their desire to have a secure US-only supply base. Just this week, we were very pleased to announce that the DOD awarded Intel Foundry Phase Three of the RAMP-C program, which we are confident will lead to additional federal, aerospace, and defense customers. More broadly, we are seeing growing interest in Intel 18A, and we continue to have a strong pipeline of nearly 50 test chips. The near-term interest in Intel Foundry continues to be strongest with advanced packaging, which now includes engagements with nearly every foundry customer in the industry, including five design awards.\nWhile we are highly focused on improving the near-term profitability of Intel Foundry, it is also important that we keep sight of the long-term opportunity here. The Foundry market is expected to grow from $110 billion today to $240 billion by 2030, with almost 90% of the growth coming from EUV nodes and advanced packaging. Given this backdrop, we have a clear line of sight to becoming the largest system foundry for the AI era and the second largest overall by 2030, building on our EUV High NA process technology, leadership in advanced packaging, manufacturing capacity, our systems expertise, and the surge in AI demand. Put another way, our $15 billion of external revenue embedded in our Intel Foundry target model would represent less than 15% of the leading-edge Foundry market. It is not a question of if, but when Intel Foundry achieves escape velocity.\nEvery day, we are proving to the market that Intel Foundry is a resilient, sustainable, and trusted alternative to serve a semi-market on a path to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Let me wrap up by speaking to our all-other category, where our number one priority is to unlock shareholder value. This quarter, we formally rebranded our Programmable Solutions Group, Altera, an Intel company. We look forward to bringing in a private equity partner this year to help prepare the company for an IPO in the coming years. This puts Altera on a similar path as Mobileye. We are excited about the future of both companies. By providing them with separation and autonomy, we believe we enhance their ability to capitalize on their growth opportunities in their respective market and accelerate their path to create value.\nCombined with IMS, our mask writing equipment business, we believe these three assets represent more than a quarter of our overall market value today. Along with a solid Intel Products franchise and an Intel Foundry business rapidly approaching $100 billion in net tangible assets, we see the opportunity to unlock significant value for our shareholders as we meet our financial commitments, stand up Intel Foundry and drive it to profitability, and further leverage our opportunity in AI. So overall, I'll say that there is a lot for us to build on coming out of Q1. We are systematically executing to our strategy, and we are making steady progress. We are maniacally focused on executional excellence and fiscal discipline, and we are relentless in our drive to regain process leadership and bring next-generation solutions to solve our customers' hardest problems. All of this gives me confidence in where we are headed.\nYes, we have a lot of hard work in front of us, but we know what we need to do, and the payoff will be significant in the end. Semiconductors are the currency that will drive the global economy for decades to come. We are one of two, maybe three companies in the world that can continue to enable next-generation chip technologies and the only one that has Western capacity and R&D. And we will participate in the entire AI market. Quarter by quarter, we are positioning ourselves well to capitalize on the immense opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn things over to Dave.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid results in the quarter, with revenue finishing in line, and gross margin and EPS again beating guidance.\nForward-looking demand signals in our core markets improved at a measured pace through the first quarter, and we expect to deliver full-year revenue and EPS growth in 2024, with the pace of revenue growth accelerating in the second half. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and just above the midpoint of our guidance, with product segments performing in line with expectations. Intel Products delivered 17% year-over-year growth, offset by inventory headwinds impacting Mobileye, Altera, and our 5G customers, as well as the sunsetting of several non-core lines of business, including the traditional packaging business within Intel Foundry. These non-core revenue headwinds drove a sequential decline of just over $1 billion, in line with our Q1 guidance. Gross margin was 45.1%, 60 basis points above guidance. An EPS of $0.18 beat guidance by $0.05 on operating spending discipline and strong sell-through of previously reserved inventory.\nQ1 operating cash flow was negative $1.2 billion. Net CapEx was $5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.2 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. We expect Q1 to be the low point for adjusted free cash flow, driven by seasonal factors, including timing of annual bonus payments, along with upsides from larger capital offsets expected in the second half. As Pat mentioned, this is our first quarter reporting in the new operating segments. The revised structure creates a foundry relationship between manufacturing and our products groups, with Intel Products purchasing wafers and services from Intel Foundry at fair market prices. This quarter represents another important step in our transformation, with increased transparency and accountability across all layers of the organization, which is already having a positive impact on decision-making, efficiencies, and financial discipline.\nAs I talk about our results, I'll categorize them between Intel Products, Intel Foundry, and all other, with the all-other category including the results of Mobileye and Altera. Additional detail can be found in our earnings release and SEC filings. Intel Products revenue was $11.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The client business grew by more than 30% year-over-year, with a strong product portfolio and share position and significantly improved customer inventory levels. The data center and AI business contributed 5% year-over-year growth, driven by higher Xeon ASPs and improved enterprise demand. NEX revenue declined 8% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, we saw significant declines in the 5G market, partially offset by approximately 10% year-over-year growth in our network and edge markets, which we expect to continue to recover through the year.\nIntel Products operating profit expanded by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue, better sell-through of reserved inventory, and operating spending discipline, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 28% in the quarter. Intel Foundry revenue was $4.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year on lower back-end services and sample revenue, along with lower IMS tool sales. In addition, wafer volume was modestly higher in the quarter, with ASPs modestly down, driven by pricing for mature nodes. Operating profit declined by approximately $100 million year-over-year, with lower revenue being partially offset by improved factory utilization. Op margin declined significantly quarter over quarter, driven by higher startup costs and the conclusion of the traditional packaging business impacting revenue.\nThe Foundry P&L will remain challenged through the year, and we expect operating margins to trough in 2024 as startup costs associated with five-nodes-in-four-years peak, and the P&L absorbs an expected increase of roughly $2 billion in depreciation. Beyond 2024, as volume begins to shift toward leadership manufacturing nodes with a competitive cost structure, scale improves, including the return of compute tiles to internal process nodes, and our efficiency actions begin to flow through the P&L, we expect to see rapid profitability improvement. Mobileye revenue of $239 million and an operating loss of $68 million were both down meaningfully year-over-year due to a well-publicized drawdown of Q1 customer inventory. Mobileye reiterated full-year guidance on their earnings call this morning. With the inventory digestion process on track, financial results are expected to recover quickly.\nAltera revenue was $342 million, down significantly year-over-year, with results impacted by the industry-wide inventory digestion following supply constraints in 2022 and 2023. Altera's $39 million operating loss is a result of lower revenue and spending associated with standing up Altera as a standalone company. We continue to expect Altera to exit 2024 at a $2 billion revenue run rate as inventory positions normalize. I want to acknowledge the hard work and focused execution across the company to transition our systems and processes to our new reporting structure. We're already seeing the results of the increased transparency catalyzing change and driving efficiencies across the company. Now, turning to our Q2 guidance, we expect revenue of $12.5 to 13.5 billion in the second quarter, with the midpoint aligned to typical seasonal growth.\nAt the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 43.5%, with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.10, all on a non-GAAP basis. We see the client and data center business roughly flat to Q1 results at the low end of seasonal. Q2 client revenue is constrained by wafer-level assembly supply, which is impacting our ability to meet demand for our Core Ultra-based AI PCs. We do expect sequential growth from Mobileye, NEX, and Foundry services. As we look beyond Q2 guidance, we expect growth across all segments in the second half of the year, led by improved demand for general-purpose servers from both Cloud and Enterprise customers, and increased Core Ultra-assembly capacity to support a growing PC TAM, driven by enterprise refresh and the AI PC.\nWe should also see accelerating growth from our network and edge businesses, a return to growth for Altera, and a meaningful Gaudi ramp in the second half. Despite 2024 representing the peak for five-nodes-in-four-years driven factory startup costs, we expect roughly 200 basis points of FY 2024 gross margin improvement compared to FY 2023. Our net capital intensity forecast of mid-30s as a percent of revenue across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate remains unchanged. With significant capital offsets expected to land in the second half of the year, we continue to expect approximately neutral 2024 adjusted free cash flow. While first-half demand signals have been a bit weaker, Q1 played out largely in line with our expectations. We achieved several important milestones towards our IDM 2.0 vision, and we're participating in a large and growing TAM with encouraging market signals for the second half of the year and into 2025.\nBy capturing margin at both the foundry level and the fabless product level, we have margin stacking advantage unique in the industry. We are three years into our transformation, and 2024 represents the steepest part of the climb, with five-nodes-in-four-years startup costs peaking, and the majority of our volume on pre-EUV process nodes with uncompetitive economics. However, as we crest the hill and look toward the next few years, we have strong winds at our back and a clear path to achieving the mid- and long-term financial targets we laid out earlier this month. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call.\nAs a reminder, we request that each of you ask one question and a brief follow-up where applicable, so that we can get to as many of your questions as possible. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess for my first question, I wanted to dive into the demand side of the equation. What was weaker in the near term than you had expected? And much more importantly, it seems like the back half, you're going to have double-digit sequential growth in largely both quarters, so that's significantly above seasonal.\nI know you went through some of the reasons at a high level, but can you dive a little bit deeper into what gives you that level of confidence in the second-half ramp?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Starting out, Ross, thanks for the question. I'll just say the market was weaker, and you've seen that in a number of others that have commented as well. So I'll say somewhat across the board a bit. We've seen that cloud customers, enterprise across geo. So I'll just say a bit weaker demand, and we'll just say at the low end of seasonality, Q1 to Q2 that we saw. As we go into the second half of the year, we're engaging deeply with our customers today, our OEM partners, and we just see strength across the board.\nPart of that is driven by our unique product position, some of it driven by the market characteristics and client AI PC and a second-half Windows upgrade cycle, we believe, underway, and Core Ultra is hot. And as we said, even in Q2, we're racing. We're meeting all of our commitments, but not all of the upside requests that we're seeing from customers. So we see a very strong AI PC outlook. In the data center, as we bring in our new products, we're seeing ASPs increase very healthy on our data center products. And with products like Sierra Forest that we just went to production with this week on Intel 3, we're seeing improved product position as well for competitiveness. We have the $0.5 billion of Gaudi, and most of that's second-half loaded.\nAnd all other businesses coming out of inventory positions in Altera and Mobileye and NEX, all of those improve first half to second half as well. And then incremental, I'll just say, Intel Foundry. It's like every quarter from here till the decade ends, we're seeing improvement in the Intel Foundry. And one by one, we're seeing all of those business improvements, both on revenue, and margin improvements over time. So we feel very comfortable that the second-half outlook is quite strong for the business. First half a bit weaker, but we think it's very understandable, very explainable, and a second-half outlook that will be very comfortable for every business across Intel growing and a lot of momentum as we go into 2025.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nI do.\nMaybe for Dave on the gross margin side, nice upside in the first quarter, but the drop in the second quarter is a little bit puzzling with revenues going up. So could you just talk a little bit about that second quarter drop and then the confidence in the rebound in the second half? Is that just revenue-driven in the second half, or what's the key metrics there, please?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Good. Thanks, Ross. Maybe start with Q1 because it somewhat explains Q2. We had better sell-through of product. Pat even mentioned Meteor Lake strength. That better sell-through was on previously reserved material, and so we just saw some upside in gross margins because of that. We had a little bit more of a flattish plan between Q1 and Q2 in terms of how that would flow through.\nAnd so it kind of pulled some of the benefit of gross margin improvement we would have seen in Q2 and kind of pulled it into Q1. So that was part of it. The second part is, as we talked about, this year was going to be a heavy year for startup costs for us, and it really shows up more meaningfully in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And so that puts a little added pressure on gross margins. As you point out, the upside in the revenue, we will have good fall-through in Q3 and Q4. That will help lift the gross margins from where they are today. And then on top of that, we'll see some areas which have high gross margins helping us, like for example, Mobileye.\nWe get good gross margins from Mobileye, and the strength that we'll see through the year there and products like that will also help drive better gross margins in the back half of the year. As we look into 2025, I think we'll have better gross margins in 2025 than we had in 2024. So this should be an ongoing story for us on the gross margin front. And as you know, we're driving to get kind of mid-50s gross margins by the midpoint between now and 2030 and ultimately getting to 60%. Of course, revenue will be part of that, but a lot of that is within our control. It's things like 18A wafer pricing, growing at 3x the cost of 18A. That will help drive margins. The pull-in of tiles, as Pat mentioned, internally is going to drive better gross margins for us over time.\nAll of what we're doing in terms of resegmenting the business is to drive better decision-making. That better decision-making will translate into significant cost improvements for us, which should also be a meaningful driver for gross margins over time as well. And of course, as Pat mentioned, we're happy to get the chips announcement out. And of course, that coupled with what we expect from the EU and the investment tax credit will also be major tailwinds on gross margins over a long-term basis.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your question, please.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the chance to ask a question here. Hey, Pat, can you talk a little bit more about servers in the data center? There was talk of a bottom there in previous discussion.\nHow do you see that kind of going throughout the year in light of your Q2 guidance, and what's the catalyst for the pickup there? Thanks a lot.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, Ben. Obviously, as we look at our position in the data center, I'll just say we're stabilizing. With that, we're improving our competitiveness. We also see, as I mentioned in the comments, that the ASPs are going up comfortably as well. So, socket shipments are fairly stable through the year, but the ASP per socket with increased core count improves our position. Then, new products like Sierra Forest or Xeon 6 product definitely gives us power performance capabilities. So overall, we're seeing a very healthy growth rate, mid-20s as we go through the year. We're also seeing increasing interest in the AI capabilities of Xeon. We're winning head node positions, and we're seeing pretty extraordinary performance.\nAt Vision, we talked about the ability to now run 70 billion parameter models directly on Xeon. And these types of capabilities, say, for a lot of enterprise use cases, Xeon is a very strong product. And as we laid out at Vision, the ability for Xeon plus Gaudi to start positioning this open platform for enterprise AI is a very strong position for us. So overall, we feel like we're on a solid trajectory into a market that, even though it's been dominated by the Gen AI theme, as enterprises, our OEMs and ODMs are communicating, there's growth here in servers, and we now have a much better product position, improving ASPs, and a better overall positioning in AI for a lot of these use cases where it's Xeon CPU plus GPU and accelerator.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nBen, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Thanks.\nCan we just double-click also on Gaudi, $500 million in the back half of the year? I think you previously talked about a couple billion in the pipeline. What does that say about your yield to revenue on an annualized basis with AI? And is there an update on the pipeline and your confidence there heading into 2025 on the accelerator front?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ben. And obviously, pipeline converting into revenue, revenue is much more meaningful, as we said, greater than $500 million for the year. And that's obviously quarter on quarter accelerating rapidly, which also gives a great indication for the business in 2025 as well. At our Vision event, we had over 20 customers publicly describing their embrace of Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3. And I was super pleased to see the breadth of those customers. It was CSPs like Naver, Ola, and IBM Cloud.\nIt was ISVs like Seekr coming on board. But maybe most importantly, enterprise customers. And ultimately, Gen AI training, okay, creating models, but enterprises are going to use models. And that's where our TCO benefits, the ability for us to action customers' data in their enterprise environment, is so powerful. And customers like Bosch were coming forward, and Roche, to be able to demonstrate the true benefits of Gaudi and Xeon plus Gaudi. The roadmap is in good shape. The Gaudi 3, Falcon Shores in 2025. We're also seeing that the industry wants open alternatives. And we announced our AI networking initiative, Ultra Ethernet Consortium, standardizing on scale-up and scale-out to Ethernet, increasing work for abstract levels of AI development with PyTorch, and the embrace of the Open Platform for Enterprise AI that we rolled out.\nAll of those taken together, the industry is looking for open enterprise alternatives for generative AI deployment, and Intel's quite well positioned. And we're starting to really see that uptake in our accelerator and Xeon pipeline now.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk to the server roadmap. It sounds like you're confirming the timeframe for both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. Can you talk about, is there demand for the Sierra Forest product as well? Do you expect that to be bifurcated where you see demand for both? And then how quickly might you see those products come to volume?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. So Sierra Forest, our first Xeon 6 product on Intel 3, and super proud.\nNow we have leadership process technology back on American soil for the first time in a decade. This is really exciting. And Sierra Forest, high core count, 144, 288 core product, very focused on power, performance, efficiency. And we do see a good pipeline of customers and a good pipeline of, I'll say, socket win-backs because the area of power performance has been an area that we've been carrying a deficit, being on an older node. And now that we're on leadership nodes, we definitely see share gains for that. Of course, Granite Rapids, which will come in Q3, the Xeon 6 P-core part is much more the bread and butter of the Xeon family. So we do see that being a stronger element to the portfolio this year as we haven't been participating in the power performance sockets as aggressively lately. And Sierra Forest gives us that tool.\nSo it really is a one-two punch, as we've described. And with Granite coming in Q3 and a volume ramp on Intel 3 with that, we feel we have a very good product line. Next year is Clearwater Forest, the second generation of the E-core part, the leadership position on 18A in the server market, a very strong product for us. Unquestioned leadership and power performance. So I believe that's a great opportunity for us to gain share again in the data center. So the roadmap is healthy. The execution is strong. And we're rebuilding customer trust. They're looking at us now and saying, \"Oh, Intel is back.\" And we're quite excited by that. And then beyond that, building the volume, building the confidence, and the momentum for traditional use cases as well as the AI use cases, as I just referred on Ben's question as well.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I do. Thank you. On the Foundry webinar, you had sort of talked about Intel 3 volume being kind of more of an inflection next year. Does that mean that within server that these Intel 3 products sort of get to volume crossover kind of some point next year, or could we see? Obviously, the leadership you just talked about is important. What's kind of keeping you from getting those products ramping in the second half?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, Joe, thank you. Servers always just take a while to ramp. Customers bring them in. They qualify them. They test them because they're generally putting these things at scale. So there's just an adoption cycle for server products. The numbers that I'm holding my team accountable for are some of the most aggressive volume ramps that we've ever achieved on server products.\nSo we're driving them very hard. That said, in terms of the total wafer volume this year, it's dominated by Intel 7. The Intel 4 and 3 wafer volumes become much more prominent next year. That's what I was communicating on the webinar. But as we go through the year, you're going to start to see the wafer ASPs pick up as a result of Intel 4, 3 ramping and much better ASP points, better margins associated with those. They'll become much more prominent in the foundry P&L next year. These are production ramps that are already underway on Intel 3. The Intel 4 ramp is already underway. We began that second half of last year. So these wafer ramps are underway with volume productions, volume products that we're bringing to the marketplace. Very confident in our ability.\nAnd then, of course, 18A, as we deliver the PDK for that in Q2, the 1.0 PDK. And we'll begin the volume ramps on Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake in the first half of next year for those products coming out. So we feel very comfortable with that overall picture that we've laid out. So thank you, Joe.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities. And your question, please?\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho Securities\n\nYeah. Hey, Pat, just a quick question on the Granite Rapids. Any thoughts on the timing and do you expect to regain some computing share, server share there with those ramps?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Vijay. And building a little bit on the last question, Granite Rapids will come in Q3 of this year when we'll have the production release of that product.\nSame as it just takes some time for customers to get comfortable, qualify, and bring those products to marketplace. But Sierra Forest, Granite Rapids, these are much more competitive power performance products on Intel 3. So we see them stabilizing and then giving us opportunity to regain share. And as we go into next year, we expect that we're regaining share as we end this year and go into next year. These are great products, and we're going to be ramping them very aggressively with our customers.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nVijay, do you have a follow-up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYeah. Thanks. Just on the GPU side, on the AI side, any thoughts on Falcon Shores? Any preliminary takes on that? How do you see that building out into 2025? Thanks.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. And Gaudi 3 announcement this quarter, extremely well received. And as I mentioned already, 20+ customers for Gaudi 2, 3. So we're seeing that build.\nObviously, Falcon Shores will build on that momentum. We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores, when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. Then we have a rich, very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PCIe card to it, this use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerators, getting very good response from customers as well. We'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases. Falcon Shores will just build on the momentum that we're establishing with Gaudi 2 and 3.\nWe also described customers coming on the Intel Developer Cloud, where we're getting these products very early in their life available for developers and enterprise customers. And customers like Seekr now, our biggest Intel Developer Cloud win to date, was seeing the benefits. But the bigger story is, how do we unleash the data assets of our enterprise customers? And that's things like the Open Platform for Enterprise AI that we launched at Open Summit. So overall, a lot of good things happening to unleash the Gen AI cycle for Intel. And of course, as we're doing this, AI is a hot market. We're participating across all of our segments, whether that's client, edge, enterprise, or our foundry opportunities as well, delivering AI everywhere.\nThanks, Vijay. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities.\nIt's your question, please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I also wanted to ask about gross margin. You did say it'd be better next year, but it is really whipping around a lot. And it looks like you sort of have to exit this year at 48% or maybe a little higher, which is already well above the 45.5% that you'll be at this year because you're guiding it up to 100 basis points. So I know you don't want to guide next year, but if you can even qualitatively help us, can you sustain those margins at that level? And I ask because last year you sort of exited at 49%, and then things crashed here during the first half of the year.\nSo can you help us just think about what some of the puts and takes will be next year off of that high base that you're going to exit this year at?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Good question. So there'll be additional startup costs next year. We do think on a percent of revenue basis, it will be lower. So that should help lift the margins. Of course, the expectation would be we'd see growth in revenue. That also should help. On top of that, we already are seeing good decision-making and changing decision-making around how we operate now under this new different business structure that we have at this point. A lot of that stuff doesn't actually show up in the P&L, though.\nAll these decisions get made this year, but a lot of the decisions made, sorry, a lot of the benefits to those decisions don't show up until next year and the year after. So we should see some benefit from that as well. The other thing that kind of has whipped our margins around a bit over the last few years has been this notion where we reserve material all the way up until the PRQ. Pat just mentioned that Sierra Forest just PRQ. So ordinarily, we take a whole bunch of reserves on Sierra Forest, and then we would release them as we started shipping beyond the PRQ date. We won't be doing that going forward. So that should help adjust the volatility of the gross margin. So it'll be more a function of revenue growth, spending profile in the fabs, startup costs that we'd have, and the mix.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do. I do, yes. So I wanted to ask about server CPU share. March, I think the assumption for March was that server share was going to be pretty flat. So the question is, was that the case? And you sound maybe a little bit less optimistic if I'm sort of reading between the lines on share into the back half of the year, just given how long it takes these things to sort of impact your share. So your bullish outlook in the second half of the year, it sounds like it's more market-driven versus share-driven. Can you just clarify that? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nWell, overall, I'd like to say it's hard to predict exactly how these will play out in light of the overall Gen AI surge that we've seen. That said, products are good.\nWe came into the year improving our market share position in Q1 of the year. It does take time to ramp these new products, but better products, rebuilding trust with our customers that we're delivering on these and now hitting what we would call the early end of the cycles on these new products, is giving us a lot of interest with the market and the customer. New use cases also demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Granite Rapids at our vision event. All of these just make us more and more confident in our business execution. We're also seeing that we don't need socket count to increase. The ASPs are going up with the core counts on our new leadership products as well.\nSo all of those in a fairly optimistic view that we're getting from our OEMs and our channel partners for their view of upgrade cycles, building momentum from customers across the industry. We feel very comfortable that we're stabilizing our position. We have an improving roadmap, and we do expect to see share gains as we end the year and go into 2025.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you. My question is on the client side. I think, Pat, you mentioned something about supply constraints impacting your Q2 outlook. If you could provide some color as to what's causing those supply constraints and when do you expect those to ease as we, I guess, go into the second half?\nAnd then in terms of your AI PCs, I think you've been talking about 40 million or so potentially shipping this year. Could you maybe put that into some context as to how it actually helps Intel? Is it just higher ASP? Is it higher margin? I would think that these products also come with higher costs. So I just want to understand how we should think about the benefit to Intel as these AI PCs ramp.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you. And overall, as we've seen, this is a hot product, the AI PC category, and we declared this as we finished last year. And we've just been incrementing up our AI PC or the Core Ultra product volumes throughout. We're meeting our customer commitments that we've had, but they've come back and asked for upside on multiple occasions across different markets.\nWe are racing to catch up to those upside requests. The constraint has been on the back end, wafer-level assembly, one of the new capabilities that are part of Meteor Lake and our subsequent client products. With that, we're working to catch up and build more wafer-level assembly capacity to meet those. How does it help us? Hey, it's a new category. That new category products will generally be at higher ASPs, as your question suggests. We also think it's new use cases. New use cases over time create a larger TAM. It creates an upgrade cycle that we're seeing. It creates new applications.\nWe're seeing essentially every ISV AI-ifying their app, whether it's the communications capabilities of Zoom and Teams for translation and contextualization, whether it's new security capabilities with CrowdStrike and others finding new ways to do security on the client, or it's creators and gamers taking advantage of this. So we see that every PC is going to become an AI PC over time. And when you have that kind of cycle underway, Srini, everybody starts to say, \"Oh, how do I upgrade my platforms?\" And we even demonstrated how we're using AI PC in the Intel factories now to improve yields and performance inside of our own factories. And as I've described, it was like a Centrino moment, where Centrino ushered in Wi-Fi at scale. We see the AI PC ushering in these new use cases at scale. That's going to be great for the industry.\nBut as the unquestioned market leader, the leader in the category creation, we think we're going to differentially benefit from the emergence of the AI PC.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nSrini, do you have a follow-up?\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James",
    "content2": "Yes, John, thank you. I guess my other question is on the other bucket. I think, Dave, you kind of talked about Altera potentially exiting the year at a 2 billion run rate. From current levels, that's a pretty steep ramp. Also, I think you said net growth will accelerate over the next couple of quarters. So given the telecom weakness out there that we're seeing, I'm just curious as to what's giving you that visibility or confidence. I mean, is this driven by some new products, or is it just the market recovering? Any color would be helpful. Thank you.\nYeah.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nOn Altera, and this is not unprecedented, when you see a massive workdown of inventory, of course, that significantly impacts the revenue. But as that normalizes, then you start shipping to end consumption. So it's actually a pretty easy lift to get to the $2 billion mark once we're through the inventory digestion period. So I think we have high confidence on that.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nAnd others have commented on their inventory cycles as well in the FPGA category. We have good products in the second half of the year with Agilex starting to ramp as well.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nAnd then on NEX, of course, that business also has gone through its own inventory adjustments. So we have good confidence around that reversing, which will help drive strength.\nAnd then some of the products that are more tailored to the AI space, of course, we'll see like Xeon, for example, we'll see strength through the year. And so that should drive good revenue growth through the year as well.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. And also on next, the AI networking products are strong, our IPU products we're seeing a strength in that area. So it's inventory as well as products, even though, as your question suggests, the communication sector, and the service providers that is weaker through the year. But pretty much every aspect of their business, and edge AI, as Dave said, is seeing strength as we go into the second half of the year and into 2025.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Srini. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. Pat, just a conceptual question. In a Gen AI server with accelerators, how important is the role of a specific CPU, or is it easily interchangeable between yours or AMD's or ARM's? I guess the question is that if most of the workload is being done on the accelerator, does it really matter which CPU I use? And can that move towards Gen AI servers essentially shrink the TAM for x86 server CPUs? Because a number of your cloud customers have announced ARM-based server alternatives. So I'm just curious, how do you think about that conversion over to Gen AI and what that means for x86 server CPU TAM going forward?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Vivek.\nAnd we spoke at our vision event about use cases like RAG, retrieval-augmented generation, where the LLMs might run on an accelerator, but all of the real-time data, all of the databases, all of the embeddings is running on the CPU. So you're seeing all of these data environments, which are already running on Xeon and x86, being augmented with AI capabilities to feed an LLM. And I believe this whole area of RAG becomes one of the primary use cases for enterprise AI. And if you think about it, an LLM might be trained with one, two-year-old data, but many of the business processes and environment are real-time. You're not going to be retraining constantly. And that's where this area of the front-end database becomes very prominent. All of those databases run on x86 today. All of them are being enhanced for use cases like RAG.\nAnd that's why we see this unlock occurring, because the data sits on-prem, the data sits in the x86 database environments that are all being enhanced against these use cases. And as we've shown, we don't need accelerators in some cases. We can run a 70 billion parameter model natively on Xeon with extraordinary TCO value for customers. And furthermore, all of the IT environments that enterprises run today, they have the security, they have the networking, they have the management technologies in place. They don't need to upgrade or change those for many of those use cases. So we see a lot of opportunity here to build on the enterprise asset that we have with the Xeon franchise. But we're also going to be aggressively augmenting that. And we're commonly the head node, even when it's other accelerators being used or other GPUs being used.\nAnd as we've described, Xeon plus Gaudi, we think it's going to be a very powerful opportunity for enterprises. So in many of those cases, we see this as a market lift, new applications, new use cases, and new energy coming to the enterprise AI. Here we are in year 23 of the cloud. And while 60% of the workload has moved to the cloud, over 80% of the data remains on-prem under the control of the enterprise, much of that underutilized in businesses today. That's what Gen AI is going to unlock. And a lot of that is going to happen through the x86 CPU. And we see a powerful cycle emerging. And I would just point you back to what we described, that vision. This was a great event, and many customers are seeing that value today.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nVivek, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes. Thank you.\nMaybe one for Dave on the potential operating loss, kind of how do we model that for the foundry business? So let's say if I exclude the $2 billion in depreciation headwind, which I'm assuming is almost all going to your foundry business, what is the right way, Dave, to think about foundry operating income or loss this year? And how much of external foundry revenue are you expecting this year? Thank you.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Good question. The operating losses will pick up. We roughly were at like $2.4-ish in the Q1. It will pick up in the Q2 given the startup costs are increasing. And I would say we roughly in that range for the remainder of the year. And then what I said before is we see that improving then going into 2025. And Pat's given me the order.\nHe wants to see every quarter some improvement in the operating loss, ultimately to get to break even midway through the point between now and 2030. I think that is very achievable. I'm sorry, Vivek. What was the second question? Did he lose?\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nVivek, are you still on?\n\nOperator\n\nNo, we've moved on.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nOkay. Why don't we go to the next caller, Jonathan?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question, one moment. Comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question, please.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Thank you very much, guys. Pat, one question I've been getting from some folks, and I totally understand the lead times of starting some of these programs to put increased tile volume at external foundry. But you guys have made the progress on the five-nodes-in-four-years, as you highlighted multiple times.\nIs there any flex at all to bring back some of that external volume earlier? And I think it matters to some folks because it's a demonstration of you guys being able to ramp your own product to volume and to yield and to economics on 18A, which might give some indication to some external customers that are looking at your foundry business. So just any flex at all to pull that timeline in of sort of reshoring some of the external tiles? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Matt. And largely, those decisions are made when the product decisions are made. So there's limited flexibility to move them around. And if you pick a process node for a certain tile, generally, that's the process node that it's on. So there's limited flexibility there. And many of those decisions, as we've highlighted before, Matt, were literally made years ago.\nThose choices were made. That said, we see the peak of our external tiles being this year and next year. Then the roadmap and the movement of those coming back begins to quite accelerate, even starting late next year. So the plan is clearly laid out. As we said, we see a couple of fabs' worth of capacity coming back into the Intel factory network as we move into 2026 and beyond. So this becomes a significant driver. We've also driven significant roadmap decisions against that improving profile of our products. And I'll say that begins in a very powerful way next year with Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest. Unquestioned, the best products and clients, the best products and server are now being built on Intel 18A. And as the question suggests, we see customers seeing that.\nEvery foundry customer that we speak to, understanding where we are in our product and process cycle and the ability for them to essentially benefit from Intel as customer zero in the foundry network. So overall, this is feeling very good. We're on track to go accomplish that. And the business model that we've laid out and Dave and I presented as we go through the decade shows a very healthy improvement in wafer ASP, wafer volume foundry. And these decisions are made. We're on track to both have the wafer foundry capabilities, have the process technology, and the products to fill those factories. And that's why Dave and I have such confidence in the business model that we've laid out and the improvements that it will deliver as we go over the next several years together.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nMatt, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes, John, thank you.\nI wanted to ask a question about the AI accelerator roadmap. So you guys have Gaudi 3 that you talked about and Falcon Shores coming next year. And the hardware looks quite good. I wanted to ask a question about the software that goes on top of that for both, well, really for inference, but also for training. How do you feel about the software roadmap that you guys have in the AI space going forward? And how much compatibility or uniqueness, rather, is there to the software that runs on Gaudi 3 versus what will come on Falcon Shores and the forward roadmap? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Maybe three different points there. The first one is for inferencing, you need a whole lot less software compatibility.\nAs the market is more focused on inferencing going forward, if you can run the models in the context of the databases and the others, so that presents and is why we're seeing the strength that we're seeing right now, Matt, in these use cases. Clearly, some of the software compatibility issues of a GPU have led to the training environments that have been challenging for us. But now, as customers get much more focused on enterprise use cases, inferencing, TCO, we're finding a lot of strength in the offerings that we have. As we've matured a number of customers now, we've worked through many of those use cases and getting quite a lot of acceptance of the software stack that we have with Gaudi 2 and 3. We will have a very smooth and seamless upgrade from Gaudi 3 into Falcon Shores.\nBut the powerful thing that will come with Falcon Shores is the full programmability that you'll see with the complete instruction set capabilities of Falcon Shores. And at that point, we will have no deficits for any of the use cases and much greater compatibility for the full range of AI capabilities. The other thing that I emphasized is Xeon is a powerful capability with incredible programmable capabilities. And we're finding these use cases, like I described, with the Open Platform for Enterprise AI. RAG use cases is clearly beneficial there for us. So overall, we're feeling like the software story is coming together very nicely. And the entire industry is moving to higher-level software abstractions such as Python and Triton. So they're moving away from any of these dependencies to an open software platform. So the industry trends are in the right direction.\nOur maturity is in the right direction. Our software stack has gotten much more mature. We'll have a very smooth upgrade to Falcon Shores. So let me just close our time together and say thank you for the questions. Thanks for joining our call. We appreciate the update to give you on a very solid Q1. We got a lot done in Q1 that gives us a great foundation for the future. We continue to drive our process, product, and AI innovations and delivering on our process technology and leadership roadmap. If any of you are at COMPUTEX in a few months, I look forward to seeing you there. We have a number of products and offerings that we'll be announcing there as we continue our AI momentum and competitiveness. As always, we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.\nThank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intel Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star one one on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star one one again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com.\nFor those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains reference to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, John, and welcome, everyone. We've reported solid Q1 results, delivering revenue in line, and EPS above our guidance as we continue to focus on operating leverage and expense management. Our results reflect our disciplined approach on reducing costs, as well as the steady progress we are making against our long-term priorities. While first-half trends are modestly weaker than we originally anticipated, they are consistent with what others have said, and also reflect some of our own near-term supply constraints.\nWe continue to see Q1 as the bottom, and we expect sequential revenue growth to strengthen throughout the year and into 2025, underpinned by one, the beginnings of an enterprise refresh cycle and growing momentum for AI PCs, two, a data center recovery with a return to more normal CPU buying patterns and ramping of our accelerator offerings, and three, cyclical recoveries in NEX, Mobileye, and Altera. We had an extremely productive Q1 and achieved several important milestones along our journey to reposition the company for improved execution, competitiveness, and perhaps most importantly, financial results. We hosted our first-ever Intel Foundry Direct Connect, which drew nearly 300 partners, customers, and potential customers to hear about the momentum we are building with our foundry offerings. We were pleased to announce Microsoft as our fifth Intel 18A customer.\nWe also updated our lifetime deal value to greater than $15 billion and extended our roadmap with Intel 14A, the first process node in the industry to use High NA EUV technology. Shortly following Direct Connect, we were thrilled to join with President Biden and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to announce our position as the National Semiconductor Champion, along with the single largest award from the CHIPS and Science Act of more than $45 billion of proposed grants, tax incentives, and loans. During the second week of April, we brought together more than 1,000 of our top customers and partners at Intel Vision 2024, where we introduced our next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator. We were joined by Naver, Dell, Bosch, Supermicro, and Roche, among many others who shared how they are benefiting from Intel solutions.\nVision led straight into Open Source Summit, where we led the launch of the Open Platform for Enterprise AI project. This industry initiative aims to accelerate GenAI deployments in what will be the largest market for AI applications, starting with retrieval augmented generation, or RAG. Our Xeon plus Gaudi use cases, along with our established enterprise ecosystem, have a big role to play here. Lastly, we hosted the industry's first Sustainability Summit, underscoring our deep commitment to building a more geographically diverse, resilient, trusted, and of course, sustainable supply chain for semiconductors. We are proud of our leadership position in chemical conservation, renewable energy, and water reclamation. Our accomplishments year to date build on all the work we have done to execute on the strategy I laid out when I rejoined the company three years ago.\nJob number one was to accelerate our efforts to close the technology gap that was created by over a decade of underinvestment. The heart of phase one was five-nodes-in-four years. The rallying cry was torrid. It combined accelerating our node transitions with improving our product execution and cadence to regain customer trust. We have rebuilt our culture and execution engine and are on track to completing our five-nodes-in-four-years goal, which many of our stakeholders thought impossible at inception. In so doing, we are in a unique position with at-scale EUV technology, Western-based capacity, and at the very least, a level playing field with the market leader. Intel 20A, which helps pave the way for Intel 18A, begins production ramp in the second half of this year with Arrow Lake. We expect to release the 1.0 PDK for Intel 18A this quarter.\nFurthermore, our lead products, Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake, are already in fab, and we expect to begin production ramp of Intel 18A and these products in H1 2025 for product release in the middle of next year. Given this progress, now is the time to turn our focus to matching technology leadership with a competitive cost structure. Establishing a foundry relationship between our products group and our manufacturing group was a critical step to achieve better structural cost. This quarter, we officially transitioned to our new operating model and introduced Intel Products and Intel Foundry. Today, for the first time, we are reporting our results to reflect the new way in which we are running the company.\nSeparating the internal financial reporting between Intel Foundry and Intel Products was a critical step needed to provide transparency, accountability, and the proper incentives to allow both groups to make better decisions to optimize their own cost structures. This change also provided the added benefit of giving more transparency to our outside owners. We knew that the day-one P&L for Intel Foundry was going to spark debate, but we also knew it was important to establish a baseline and provide a target model based on reasonable to conservative revenue and cost assumptions that we have a high degree of confidence we will achieve. I want to reiterate that point so it is heard and understood. Our target model is reasonable, conservative, and reflects a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver. And you can rest assured that we will be working hard to beat these targets.\nIf we can move faster and do better, we will. Our new operating model is already coming.",

With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the culmination of a year of tremendous progress towards our IDM 2.0 transformation. We consistently executed on our plan to reestablish process leadership, further build out our capacity and foundry plans, greatly improve product execution, and began to execute on our mission to bring AI everywhere across our product segments. We delivered solid Q4 results, exceeding expectations for the fourth quarter in a row. Revenue was at the higher end of our guidance, and we had strong EPS upside as a result of our ongoing relentless focus on driving operating leverage and expense management, including comfortably meeting our $3 billion cost savings commitment for fiscal year 2023. 2023 was definitely a year when we did what we said we would do and more.\nWe intend to make 2024 another such year, and when we look out over the next 12 months, we are confident that we can continue to drive considerable progress on our IDM 2.0 journey. As we look into Q1, our core business, including client server and edge products, continues to perform well and is tracking to the lower end of seasonal. However, discrete headwinds, including Mobileye, PSG, and business exits, among others, are impacting overall revenue, leading to a lower Q1 guide. Importantly, we see this as temporary, and we expect sequential and year-on-year growth in both revenue and EPS for each quarter of fiscal year 2024. Momentum and excitement around new products and businesses remain strong as we head into the year and will grow stronger as the year progresses. We could not be prouder of the execution across our process technology roadmap in 2023.\nWe became the world's first high-volume manufacturer of logic devices using EUV in both the US and Europe as we aggressively ramp Core Ultra on Intel 4 in both Oregon and Ireland. Intel 3 achieved manufacturing readiness in Q4 as committed, with solid performance and yield progression. Our two lead vehicles in Intel 3 are on track, and we look forward to launching Sierra Forest in H1 2024, followed shortly thereafter by Granite Rapids. Sierra Forest has final samples at customers, and the production stepping of Granite Rapids is running ahead of schedule, well into PowerON validation, and very healthy. We are even more excited about breaking into the Angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. We are first in industry to have incorporated both gate all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node. The latter, unexpected, two years ahead of our competition.\nArrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle, will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in second half 2024, completing our five nodes and four-year journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A part for servers, has already gone into fab, and Panther Lake for clients will be heading into fab shortly. As we complete our goal of five nodes in four years, we are not satisfied, nor are we finished. We have begun installation of the industry's first high-NA EUV tool in our most advanced technology development site in Oregon, aimed at addressing challenges beyond 18A. We remain focused on being good stewards of Moore's Law and ensuring a continuous node migration path over the next decade and beyond. Third-party engagements with IFS continue to validate our progress on process technology.\nWe launched IFS with a long-term view of delivering the world's first system foundry that brings together a secure and sustainable supply chain with the best of Intel and our ecosystem. While our ambitions will not materialize overnight, we made tremendous progress in both Q4 and fiscal year 2023 towards our goal of becoming the second largest external foundry by 2030. The rapid adoption of AI by all industries is proving to be a significant tailwind for IFS, as high-performance compute, an area where we have considerable wafer and packaging know-how and IP, is now one of the largest and fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor market. We made major strides in building our foundry ecosystem in 2023, with now over 40 strategic agreements across EDA, design services, IP, cloud, and US military, aerospace, and government. Critical agreements with Arm and Synopsys continue to gain momentum.\nWe delivered the Intel 18A 0.9 PDK and broadened its availability in Q4. We expanded the RAMP-C program significantly, and just this quarter signed a major foundry contract with the United States government and Department of Defense. We are also very pleased to have completed a major agreement with United Microelectronics, or UMC, to develop a 12-nanometer process platform targeting high-growth markets, including mobile communication infrastructure and networking. This expands both Intel and UMC's foundry process portfolios and customer access to a broader and more resilient supply, leveraging our Arizona site. This agreement builds upon and furthers our long and deep relationships with the vibrant Taiwan ecosystem. This also meaningfully extends the production life of our installed capacity and improves our returns on investments, similar to the announcement last quarter of our Tower Semiconductor partnership at the 65-nanometer node with our New Mexico site.\nOur success with IFS will be measured by customer commitments and revenue. We have taped out more than 75 ecosystem and customer test chips. IFS already has more than 50 test chips in the pipeline across 2024 and 2025, 75% of which are on Intel 18A. During CES, we welcomed Valens Semiconductor to the growing list of foundry customers as they announced they would use IFS to fabricate their MIPI A-PHY chipsets using our advanced technology. In addition to the three Intel 18A customers we disclosed in Q3, we won a key design win with a significant high-performance computing customer. This customer was particularly motivated by our unique leading-edge manufacturing capabilities and US capacity. We came into 2023 committing to one 18A foundry customer. We executed on four, inclusive of a meaningful prepay, and our momentum continues to grow.\nOur advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another important advantage for IFS, a faster on-ramp to broader foundry relationships. During the quarter, we captured three additional advanced packaging design wins, bringing the total to five in 2023, with the majority of revenue starting in 2025. To support our growing demand, just yesterday, we opened Fab 9 in New Mexico, marking a milestone for high-volume 3D advanced packaging manufacturing. The momentum advanced packaging is very strong and is another facet of our foundry strategy, which is clearly benefiting from the surge of interest in AI. With leadership technology and available capacity, our opportunity set continues to grow. In total, across wafer and advanced packaging, our lifetime deal value for IFS is now over $10 billion, a more than doubling from the $4 billion we provided in our last update.\nSupporting our growing momentum in IFS is our global manufacturing footprint. We are the only semiconductor company with that scale and sustainable manufacturing in every major region of the world, providing ourselves and our foundry customers resilient access to the right capacity in the right regions at the right time. All of our expansion projects in the US, EU, and Asia are progressing on schedule, and our chips applications in the US and EU are progressing well. Finally, we are thrilled to be hosting our first Foundry Day IFS Direct Connect on 21 February 2024 in San Jose, where we will have the opportunity to showcase the breadth of our ecosystem, as well as begin to talk about our process roadmap beyond Intel 18A, next-generation packaging, and our full foundry vision. We hope to see many of you there. Intel continues its mission to bring AI everywhere.\nWe see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. Given our foundry and product offerings, we're the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon Logic. We have already discussed how our 50-year heritage in high-performance computing transistors and our advanced packaging positions IFS to benefit from the accelerating move to AI. Within our product portfolio, we are the only company with the products, IP, and ecosystem reach to empower customers to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications, from the cloud, through the network, into the enterprise, client, and edge. For the developer working with multi-trillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provide a powerful combination of performance, competitive MLPerf benchmarks, and leadership TCO.\nAs AI proliferates and the world moves towards more AI-integrated applications, there's a market shift toward local inferencing and smaller, more nimble models. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inferencing cost and round-trip latency. With AI-accelerated Xeon for enterprise, Core Ultra ushering in the AI PC era, and OpenVINO enabling developers' seamless and versatile support for a range of client and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than requiring it in the cloud. Our expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. In Q4, our server business experienced solid sequential growth, consistent with market share, which we believe was flat with Q3 levels.\nSince launching fourth-gen Xeon in early 2023, we have shipped more than 2.5 million units, with approximately 1/3 of all fourth-gen demand driven by AI. With our fifth-gen Xeon launch, we enable up to 42% higher AI inference performance compared to the industry-leading fourth-gen Xeon. Fifth-gen Xeon has reached general availability at Alibaba, is entering public and private previews with several CSPs, and is on track to ship with OEMs next month. More importantly, our improved execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen 4 and Gen 5 Xeon ramping well, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids coming soon, and Clearwater Forest already going into the fab. Momentum is building and positioning us well to win back share in the data center. Our Gaudi2 AI accelerators continue to demonstrate price-performance leadership compared to the most popular GPUs.\nIn a recent blog published by Databricks, Gaudi2 was shown to clearly deliver the best training and inference performance per dollar based on public cloud pricing. We're building on this momentum with Gaudi3, which is on track to launch this year and is expected to deliver performance leadership with 4x the processing power and double the networking bandwidth for greater scale-out performance. Gaudi3 is now in the lab, powered on, and showing great health and performance, and Falcon Shores is also well underway. Our accelerator pipeline for 2024 grew double-digits sequentially in Q4 and is now well above $2 billion and growing. We recently increased our supply for both Gaudi2 and Gaudi3 to support the growing customer demand, and we expect meaningful revenue acceleration throughout the year. As we announced last quarter, we are now operating PSG as a standalone business beginning on 1 January.\nOur intent is to bring in private capital this year to create an eventual path to an IPO over the coming years. As we outlined on our Q3 call, PSG is in the midst of an industry-wide cyclical correction for FPGAs, which we expect to last through the first half of 2024. Despite the financial correction, operational momentum is strong, and PSG executed its most ambitious FPGA roadmap, delivering 21 new product releases in 2023 and executing supply assurance agreements valued by our customers. Finally, even as we congratulate Sandra Rivera, the new CEO of PSG, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Justin Hotard as Executive Vice President and General Manager of DCAI. Justin joined us from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where he was Executive Vice President and General Manager of High-Performance Computing, AI, and Labs.\nHe will play a key role in helping customers accelerate their businesses with our Xeon processor family, delivering on our commitments to customers and partners by increasing our GPU and accelerator footprint and supporting our mission to bring AI everywhere. Moving to client, CCG performed very well in Q4, posting the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth. Demand reflected a normalized inventory environment with sustained strength in gaming and commercial, with our highest-end SKUs exceeding Q3 records by 20%. The 2023 consumption TAM was roughly 270 million units, consistent with our views entering the year, and we expect the PC TAM up low single digits year-on-year in 2024, in line with third-party estimates. Our share position is strong, and our product portfolio for 2024 and beyond and ecosystem work will continue to drive industry-leading performance and experiences.\nIn Q4, we ushered in the age of the AI PC with the launch of Intel Core Ultra. Representing our largest architectural shift in decades, the Core Ultra is the most AI-capable and power-efficient client processor with dedicated acceleration capabilities across the CPU, GPU, and Neural Processing Unit, or NPU. Ultra is the centerpiece of the AI PC systems that are capable of natively running popular 10-billion-parameter models and drive superior performance on key AI-enhanced applications like Zoom, Adobe, and Microsoft. We expect to ship approximately 40 million AI PCs in 2024 alone, with more than 230 designs from ultra-thin PCs to handheld gaming devices to be delivered this year from OEM partners: Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, MSI, Samsung Electronics, and others. The Core Ultra platform delivers leadership AI performance today, with our next-generation platforms launching later this year, Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake tripling our AI performance.\nIn 2025, with Panther Lake, we will grow AI performance up to an additional 2x. NEX is well-positioned to benefit from the proliferation of AI workloads on the edge, where our market-leading hardware and software assets provide improved latency, reliability, and cost. OpenVINO adoption grew by 60% sequentially in Q4 and today is a core software layer for AI inferencing on the edge, on the PC, and in the data center. NEX is also driving the shift of AI networking in the cloud from proprietary technologies to open Ethernet-based approaches in partnership with a broader industry ecosystem. NEX Q4 results beat our internal forecast, and the division is poised for solid growth in 2024 across edge, network, and FNIC products, more skewed to the second half. Yet another growing market opportunity for us is automotive.\nWhile Mobileye is experiencing a sharp inventory correction in Q1, we are encouraged by their improving forecasts throughout 2024 and, more importantly, their recent announcement at CES that they were awarded a series of production design wins by a major Western automaker across the company's three key platforms: SuperVision, Chauffeur, and Drive. In addition to Mobileye's strengths in AV, at CES, we announced the launch of AI-enhanced software-defined vehicle SOCs with Geely Zeekr brand as our first OEM partner and our agreement to acquire Silicon Mobility, a fabless silicon and software company specializing in power management SOCs focused on EVs. These announcements build on shared IP across client and data center and our existing Intel SOC footprint of more than 50 million vehicles worldwide. Our strategy will continue to broaden our exposure to the growing auto market on both the product and the foundry sides of our business.\nFinally, underpinning our across-the-board progress in 2023 is our operational and financial discipline. As our new internal foundry model, which is designed to drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on cost, begins to take root, we expect to unlock further cost savings and efficiencies in 2024 and beyond. We have officially transitioned to this new operating model on 1 January 2024 and will report the new segmentation format as part of our Q1 earnings. We see incremental efficiencies as we drive to our long-term model of 60% gross and 40% operating margins. As I reflect on our progress in 2023, I am incredibly proud of our employees whose commitment and perseverance were instrumental to the execution of our ambitious strategy. Together, we exited the year accomplishing exactly what we set out to do. We improved our execution engine, consistently being on track or ahead on our process and product roadmap.\nAs I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are confident in our performance and financial trajectory for the year ahead. We know we have much work in front of us as we work to regain and build on our leadership position in every category in which we participate. We will maintain our relentless focus on our mission and commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn things over to Dave.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial results in the quarter on top of continued execution of our products and process roadmap commitments. We again beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin, and EPS. We've taken proactive steps to prioritize our investments, aggressively managed near-term expenses, and made meaningful progress on reducing our structural cost gaps.\nWe exit 2023 a healthier and leaner company, but there is much more work to do in 2024 and beyond to deliver on our long-term financial objectives and the potential of IDM 2.0. Q4 revenue was $15.4 billion, up 9% sequentially, 10% year-over-year, and $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance, with solid execution across reported segments. Gross margin was 48.8%, 230 basis points better than our guidance, driven by favorable product mix and ASPs, improved unit costs, and higher revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.54, beating guidance by $0.10 on improved gross margins, stronger revenue, and disciplined OpEx management. Q4 operating cash flow was $4.6 billion. Net inventory was down more than $300 million in nine days in the quarter, and DSO remains under 20.\nNet CapEx was $5.9 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.3 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. Moving to the fourth-quarter business unit results, CCG delivered revenue of $8.8 billion, up 12% sequentially, 33% year-over-year, and ahead of internal expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter. We saw sustained strength in gaming and commercial segments, along with record performance notebook shipments in the quarter. Customer inventory levels have normalized, and 2023 PC consumption was in line with our 270 million unit forecast. Operating profit was $2.9 billion, up more than $800 million sequentially, and nearly $2.4 billion year-over-year on improved TAM and market share, and sell-through of reserved inventory. DCAI revenue was $4 billion, up 4% sequentially. The server business delivered double-digit growth sequentially, partially offset by the FPGA inventory correction.\nRevenue was driven by improved unit TAM, stable share, and rising average core density contributing to record Xeon ASPs. Operating profit was $78 million, roughly flat sequentially, as advanced node development costs continued to weigh on profitability. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% sequentially, and ahead of internal expectations on strength from network and Ethernet segments. The business saw an operating loss of $12 million, down modestly quarter over quarter. Intel Foundry Services contributed revenue of $291 million, down modestly on a sequential basis, and up 63% year-over-year on increased traditional packaging revenue. IFS operating loss was $113 million, driven by continued investment to develop and grow world-class system foundry. Mobileye delivered record revenue of $637 million, up 20% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, along with record operating profit of $242 million, up 42% sequentially and 15% year-over-year.\nRecently disclosed design wins are expected to contribute more than $7 billion of future revenue, or more than 3.5 times Mobileye's record FY 2023 revenue. As Pat summarized, the company made significant progress towards our IDM 2.0 strategy, including strong execution against our 2023 financial commitments despite macro headwinds throughout the year. As committed at our Q1 2023 earnings call, we delivered revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and EPS growth each quarter. Despite significant investments in future growth and continued progression through five nodes in four years, we achieved our 2023 commitment of $3 billion of spending reductions. Through a strong focus on cash and cost controls, we achieved excellent DSO and DPO in the second half of 2023 and delivered net inventory reductions of nearly $2 billion in 35 days from our peak in Q1 2023.\nWorking capital initiatives yielded roughly $2 billion of cash in 2023, helping us to meet our commitment for roughly break-even adjusted free cash flow in the second half of the year. We remain committed to our smart capital framework, with growing contributions from our SCIP agreement with Brookfield and progress toward government incentives in the US, Europe, and Israel. In Q4, we also recognized $845 million of advanced manufacturing investment credits, or AMIC, as defined in the CHIPS Act. While our continued IDM 2.0 capital investments will result in increased gross CapEx in 2024 as compared to 2023, we're on track to our aggregate 2023 through 2024 guidance of net CapEx spending in the mid-30s% of revenue, with offsets towards the high end of the 20%-30% range. Now turning to Q1 guidance, we expect Q1 revenue of $12.2 to $13.2 billion.\nAt the Q1 revenue midpoint of $12.7 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 44.5%, with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.13. While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG. Additionally, we expect a significant drop in IFS revenue after seeing accelerated purchasing in our traditional packaging business and cyclical weakness in wafer equipment buying in the first half of the year, impacting the IMS business. When combined with businesses we exited in 2023, we expect a roughly $1 billion sequential revenue impact from businesses outside of our core products. With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024, consistent with third-party views.\nOur recent results show the PC remains essential, and we remain confident in our longer-term TAM forecast as the age of the AIPC further enhances the value of device refresh. We expect Q1 data center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the data center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio with well over $2 billion in pipeline to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network, Ethernet, and edge products.\nThese signals give us confidence that consolidated revenue will grow beyond typical seasonality after a soft Q1, and that we can deliver sequential and year-over-year growth in both revenue and EPS each quarter of 2024. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly break-even adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering five nodes in four years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion. We expect depreciation to grow by approximately $2 billion in 2024, in addition to a significant increase in variable factory startup costs. 60% gross margin flow-through as a percent of revenue growth remains a rule of thumb in aggregate in the intermediate term, though we may see volatility in our quarterly gross margin results.\nWe're excited to mark the first month fully operating under our new internal foundry reporting structure, with improved accountability, transparency around cost and value drivers, and increased focus on driving higher rates of return for our owners' capital. We intend to provide you with a recast historical financials this quarter in the form of an 8-K. We will unpack the details at that time, but you will see not only the first view of our manufacturing P&L, but a view of our products group more in line with external peers. While it will come as no surprise our manufacturing P&L is under significant pressure as we get back to process leadership and build the infrastructure to meet both internal and external demand, we see abundant opportunity to drive improvement. Finally, standing up a separate legal entity for manufacturing, technology development, and IFS is important to our foundry customers.\nWe expect to have that structure in place in the second half of 2024. As we look back at 2023, we have a lot to be proud of. We entered the year with a challenging macro backdrop. I'm pleased with our team's efforts controlling spending, ramping new products, managing share, executing product and process roadmaps, and delivering for our customers. We continue to focus our portfolio by exiting five businesses in 2023, for a total of 10 since Pat's return. While also identifying profitable adjacent markets, we can serve with our existing IP, as we have done with Intel Auto. We executed within our Smart Capital framework and are beginning to see meaningful capital offsets. We unlocked value for our shareholders through Mobileye and IMS and announced our intention to pursue external investments in PSG.\nI'd like to thank the entire Intel team for the hard work and execution which drove our improved 2023 results. While we aren't yet where we want to be from a financial perspective, we're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM, our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market, and with the strong foundation of financial discipline we set in 2023, we're confident and committed to our long-term financial objectives. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first question?\nCertainly. One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I have a near-term one, and then for my follow-up, it'll be a longer-term one. So the near-term one is on the demand picture. Dave, you were helpful in breaking out the kind of the non-core impacts in the first quarter versus the core, but the low end of seasonality is a little bit of a surprise, given that cyclical pressures seem to have been abating and some of the market share trends should have been going in your favor, at least also not worsening. So can you just talk a little bit about why you're at the low end of seasonality in the first quarter for your core businesses and what gives you confidence in super seasonality thereafter? Yeah. Hey, thanks,\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss. I'll start and ask Dave to follow up. And first, what's seasonality Q4 to Q1?\nThere's a wide range of perspectives, anywhere from 3%-20% historically. So I'll just say it's a wide statement of what that looks like. Obviously, as we come into the year, it's coming off a very strong Q4. Our product lines are strong. We feel our inventory positions are healthy. We're gaining momentum across it. And obviously, we've built a forecast consistent with our customers and channel partners that we believe is merited. Obviously, Dave talked about some of the discrete events, which as we added them up, were a little bit larger than we forecast, but the core business we see is healthy. For it, we see no areas for market share loss, and the products are getting stronger. So I would say it really reflects as we view the market, but we've also said, hey, we're improving every quarter as we go through the year, right?\nImproving on revenue, top line, improving on profitability as we go through the year, and we've quite scrutinized that outlook for the year. Obviously, as the year improves, new product lines emerging, tailwinds in areas like AIPC, Gaudi ramping for accelerators. Overall, a lot of things that just keep improving as we go through the year, combined with good cost discipline. We feel quite comfortable that we're starting strong, and we're going to have an improving year as the year progresses. And what's the long-term question, Brock?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYou just the confidence in, oh, the second half. The long-term question is one, yeah, sorry. The long-term question is one on the manufacturing nodes. The five nodes in four years is going well, but one of your biggest foundry customers and competitors is doubling down on their ability to keep the leadership positioning.\nSo what gives you confidence that 18A will, in fact, have the leadership node? And how do we reconcile the fact that you seem to be using that customer as a foundry partner for some of your heterogeneous products, whether it be Arrow Lake or Lunar Lake going forward? If you have the leadership, why wouldn't you be doing that internally?\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you. I'll do that and ask Dave to pile on both of those a little bit. But with respect to the manufacturing, I'll just say, hey, we look at this every single day, and we're scrutinizing carefully our progress on 18A. And obviously, the great news that we just described, those Clearwater Forest taping out, and that gives us a lot of confidence that 18A is healthy. That's a major product for us. Panther Lake following that shortly. We've also had our fourth customer this quarter.\nSome of the IP providers are giving us very strong affirmations on the competitiveness of the process technology. Particularly, we're just way ahead on backside power. And that's not even everybody in the industry is recognizing that, and many of the customers who are looking at it are seeing substantial gains, not just in power performance, but in area savings as well. Overall, we feel very confident that our roadmap is strong on the process technology side. We do use external foundries, and obviously, that grew as we were dealing with some of our own challenges for process competitiveness. As we create more and more focus in the business, more wafers will come internal to the Intel factory network.\nBut long-term, we're going to continue to use external foundries to complement, manage our capital requirements, and to make sure that our teams always are building the best products in the industry and using the best technologies to accomplish that. So overall, we feel super good with our strategy. You'll see more use of our own factory network, even as we leverage external foundries where appropriate.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThe only other thing I'd add is just the use of external foundries as part of our Smart Capital strategy. It's one of the five pillars. So as Pat said, that will continue to be part of our strategy. Obviously, we're going to maximize how much we can do internally, but we're always going to be using external foundries based on Smart Capital.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Ross. Jonathan, the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I had a question about gross margin. It was obviously much, much better in December, and the March guidance is actually pretty good. So does this include the sale of any previously written down inventory and maybe help us get a clean margin number? Is this March number pretty clean that we can carry that incremental forward through the year?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. I mean, what I said in the prepared remarks, I think, is that we think that a 60% fall-through is probably the best rule of thumb. That said, as you know, quarter to quarter, things can move that number up and down. In Q4, we saw better fall-through. Largely, it was related to better sell-through of previously reserved product.\nWe also actually did better on the factory side in terms of spending and yield, and so that also benefited us to some extent. And then in Q1, I think we're going to do a little worse. We're going to see the fall-through be a little harder on us. And largely, that's some of that stuff going away a little bit. But I think if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's kind of a 2023 to 2024, 2024 to 2025, we'd largely expect it to be this 60% fall-through. We're going to have these quarter to quarter movements that kind of violate that because of just one-off things. But I think in general, you'll see 60% fall-through be the right measure.\nLonger term, we're obviously going to want to see that number go up because it's going to drive us to the 60% gross margins we ultimately want to attain. But in the near term, we're kind of dealing with a lot of the costs associated with five nodes in four years. It's just a lot of startup costs back. We'll probably hit our peak startup cost in 2024. So that's a huge headwind we'll have to deal with. So that's going to, I think, kind of keep us in this 60% fall-through range for the next couple of years. Tim, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nI do. I do, Dave. Yeah. Just on how you get to that 60%. So it seems like there could be persistent headwinds in terms of capacity utilization.\nI mean, I think a lot of us see that there's this plan to cut over to internal, starting with Panther Lake, but that doesn't really ramp into high volume until probably 2026. So are you managing to some sort of utilization rate for your internal capacity to sort of get to that 60%? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, maybe step back a little bit on the 60%. I mean, it will be driven by a number of factors, one of which is just revenue. Revenue growing on a largely fixed-cost business is going to help gross margins. Obviously, we have optimism around how we can drive the growth of the business. The second, as you point out, is loadings. And we are managing our capital spend and our investment with an eye on loadings to make sure that we keep those in a good place.\nObviously, last year, we had some underloadings to deal with. But as we kind of break out of that and start to move into the next year, I think we'll start to see some improvements there. Third, as we get, as Pat was talking about, to leadership in terms of nodes and products, ultimately across the entire product portfolio, that's going to help out on margins. It's going to help out from a cost structure perspective, but also better-performing products are just going to yield better pricing and so forth, better profitability. And then lastly, we've got this internal foundry model that Pat mentioned, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that we think is going to deliver just tons of savings for the company.\nI think every week that Pat and I spend on this, somebody brings up another big rock that they found of savings they can identify because they were looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, what sort of hot lots they do, and how much sample activity they use. The factory is now, as you point out, very, very hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investments associated with the loadings. We're way more focused in terms of steppings and so forth. So I think we'll get, like I said in a call a couple of quarters ago, $4 to 5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.\nAnd so that's another big step function that I think gets us to the 60% gross margins.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI'd also add things like we just announced with UMC, right? We're taking older factories. And as Tim, as you might have heard me say in the past, right, a bug in the Intel business model, right? Just when a factory got very good and depreciated, right, we moved to the next node. Well, now we're starting to fill that with long-term foundry business as well. So all of these are improving the discipline of running the business as well as how we utilize our factory networks long-term. And we really do think that the 60/40 is what Dave and I are driving the business to, and we're going to get there.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question.\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the data center decline in Q1. How much of that is a function of the weakness in FPGAs that you've talked to already? And then just any sense of what the cloud and server environment is like in the first quarter?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. So overall, obviously, we've spoken separately about the FPGA business, so let's just move that to the side. Overall, I'll say it's fairly seasonal, quarter to quarter, in what we expect. That said, we're seeing strength from our server customers. For instance, more of the OEM response is strong with regard to the momentum they're seeing in the enterprise server business. And obviously, our product line is improving there. We do expect year-on-year growth here. We see our market share stabilizing.\nObviously, as we're ramping Gen 4, Gen 5, Granite Rapids, Clearwater Forest, the momentum is building for us overall. As we indicated, hey, we think more of the AI surge is going to result in AI inferencing on-prem, which we're well-positioned to be a beneficiary of. I would just cite that here we are in year 20 of the public cloud, and you have 60%+ of compute in the cloud, but 80+% of data remains on-prem. Customers want to realize the value of that on-prem data with AI, and that's an enterprise strength for Intel. We do see all of these trends giving us a very favorable outlook for the year. There's nothing surprising about the Q1 guide here, and we're going to be very focused on beating those numbers and building on the momentum of improving product line.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I do. Along the same lines, can you talk about Sierra Forests and Granite Rapids? And I guess, how do you see the long-term mix between those? What kind of appetite do you see for the Sierra Forests, kind of higher core count designs?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you. I would love to talk for hours about Sierra Forests and Granite Rapids. I am super excited about those products, both of them on Intel 3. If I build on the last question from Tim about factory loadings, hey, we are driving hard to accelerate those products into the marketplace, and they're really the drivers of Intel 3 capacity. The mix between them, obviously, this is our first, I'll say, volume, mainstream offering for a high core count.\nI sort of view this as the cloud guys just run VMs at scale or just run containers at scale. That's what CRFRs is about, is sort of that bulk workload. It doesn't have some of the performance capabilities, peak capabilities, feature capabilities that Granite Rapids has. I expect the bulk of the market to stay on Granite Rapids-type products, the peak core products, certainly in 2024 and 2025. But we do see a pretty steady rise in the use of CRFRs. Then as we move to Clearwater Forest in 2025, a very compelling product. We do see a pretty healthy split between those for the cloud and data center customers. I think most of the enterprise customers will stay with the peak core products that they will have.\nIt really is Sierra Forests, Clearwater Forests, and successors being sort of that bulk mainstream cloud offering that's very focused on TCO. So with that, we feel super good about our product portfolio, P-cores, E-cores, really allowing us to stretch the offerings to the highest performance with high core count and to the best TCO. With that, this is a portfolio that will allow us to regain share in the core data center market. Thanks, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your question, please.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. I wanted to revisit the gross margins, and I appreciate the 60% fall-through comment that we should use as a rule of thumb.\nBut Dave, starting at 44.5 in Q1, are you still looking for the overall reported non-GAAP number to be up year-over-year from the 43.6? And you mentioned some volatility there. I just want to clarify on the call how the gross margin trajectory is going to look year-over-year, and understanding there's that volatility there. Thanks.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Yeah. To be clear, the way I was looking at gross margins is on a year-over-year basis on this 60% flow-through. So you should take the full-year gross margins that we had in 2023, which were roughly 43.5%, and think about this 60% flow-through based on the 43.6% gross margins. I think when you do that, we obviously start off at a level that's better on a year-over-year basis, but obviously down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And so you should expect generally improving dynamics through the year.\nThe only challenge will be this quarter-to-quarter always has volatility to it. So there could be quarters in which we get less ship-through of previously reserved products. Sometimes it's more. And so I'm kind of avoiding trying to pinpoint every quarter because of the difficulty around pinpointing that. But we feel very confident around the 60% flow-through. Ben, do you have a follow-up?\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Thanks, John. Could you talk a little bit more about the client market? You mentioned that corporate, you said some strength, and Dell had said there was some weakness. And heading into the first quarter, can you talk about the revenues on client and what makes you so confident that it's really going to pick up?\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks. Yeah. So as we look at the market year-on-year, we expect it to be a few points bigger than it was last year. So last year was 270.\nThis year, a couple of points higher than that. I think that's consistent with the various market forecasters that we have. Our market share position is very stable. We had good execution on market share through last year. And the product line is better this year with a number of tailwinds, like we said. So overall, we think it's going to be a very solid year for us in our client business. Obviously, as we start the year, everybody is, I'll say, managing through what their Q1 outlook looks like, even as they expect to see stronger business as we go through the year. I'd also comment, Ben, that some of these tailwinds really only start to materialize as you go into second quarter and second half. AI PC is just ramping right now. The Windows 10 EOS goes into effect, and customers are starting to look at the post-COVID refreshes.\nSo a lot of those benefits materialize as you go through the year, but our position in gaming, commercial, very strong for us overall. And I'll tell you, we're just seeing a lot of excitement for the AIPC. I describe this as the Centrino moment, the most exciting category-defining moment since Wi-Fi was introduced two-plus decades ago. So we do think that's going to bring a multi-year cycle of growth, great ISVs, great new use cases, and a product line that is clearly leading the industry, establishing this category.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nSo thanks for taking my question.\nPat, I'm curious now that we are a year into the generative AI deployments. What's your view on how cloud customers are thinking about the CapEx between traditional and AI servers? Because when we look at the revenue growth across your GPU competitors, they seem to be capturing nearly all of the incremental CapEx, and in some cases even more than, right, just the CapEx of the public cloud company. So does that really leave much room for your CPU business to grow, right, beyond just the seasonal variations? So just how are you looking at the AI market overall, and what part of that is Intel really able to capture when we just look at how much is being or needing to be dedicated to your GPU competitors?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thank you. And let's just maybe three different aspects to it. The first one is clearly the high-end cloud guys and what they're doing for maximizing training environments. Clearly, that's been an accelerator market so far. But that even is giving, I'll say, a bit of a tailwind in the sense there are lots of head nodes associated with that. We do think, as we said, that the market moves much more from high-end training to inferencing of where our product line is more substantive for it. But the enterprise market, as we see it for data centers, is very much going to be an on-premise play, taking advantage of inferencing in that data pools that they already have. And that's an area of good strength for Intel. And we're starting to see that in some of the conversations with our OEM customers.\nAs I finished probably 50 meetings between World Economic Forum and Davos and CES with customers, I'll say we have absolute unanimous response that they're going to be deploying a lot of their AI on-premise in their data centers. Xeons and our on-premise offerings are simply the preferred way for them to be taking advantage of those capabilities inside of their data centers, inside of the TCO envelopes, power, networking management that they have in place. Obviously, we need to be participating more in the accelerator piece of that. We're seeing the growing pipeline of our opportunities. We saw a nice uptick in revenue in Q4 from a small number, but a lot of momentum as we come into the year. Gaudi 3 is getting a lot of excitement, clearly leading in TCO. We're going to be competing much more for that high-end accelerator footprint.\nI think the message of 2024 is going to be inferencing, AI everywhere. That's going to be at the edge. That's going to be the AI PC. And it's going to be in the enterprise data center, all areas that Intel has a much stronger footprint.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nVivek, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes. Thank you, John. Thank you, Pat. So on the foundry side, I think you mentioned IFS, some declines in Q1 after the strong Q4 that you had. So I was hoping if you could just help us size what is IFS in Q1. And then longer term, you mentioned now you have four 18A wins. But how do we quantify what they mean for 2024 or 2025 or 2026? And I think on the call, you had mentioned somewhere about $10 billion in lifetime wins. I'm hoping that's what you meant for 18A.\nBut when I look at that $10 billion over multiple years, that is not really that big relative to, I think, the $130 billion-plus annual foundry market. So could you just help us size what does Intel's external foundry business mean for a 2024 or 2025 perspective? Thank you.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. And the two things in the Q4 to Q1 numbers on IFS. One is, I'll say, the natural ending of our traditional packaging volume. So that affects Q4 as we go into Q1. And obviously, our focus there isn't doing, I'll say, traditional packaging. That's best supplied by OSAT vendors. But we were in a unique position to help our customers as we went through the COVID cycle. All of our packaging focus going forward is advanced packaging where our technology is differentiated, the margins are good.\nAnd as you saw, we just announced the New Mexico facility as the first major advanced manufacturing facility on US soil. A lot of excitement from that from customers across the world. Also, we had our foundry equipment business, which was another factor, Q4 to Q1, very consistent with the profile that you might have heard from people like ASML, right, as they saw the quarter-to-quarter implications on the equipment business. So I'll say Q4 to Q1, all explainable in those contexts. The business we're winning, 18A foundry customers, Intel 3 packaging, it takes quarters for that to materialize, and for wafer customers, years. And that's why we said lifetime deal value is probably the best metric that we can give you to help you understand the nature of that business as it's growing. And as I said, we saw a big uptick from our prior update to this one.\nObviously, we need to, as your question suggests, get to a much bigger number. That's exactly what we're going to do. We're now well underway. We're seeing healthy growth in lifetime deal value. We'll be giving you periodic updates on it as a good metric of seeing how rapidly that business is growing for us. I've emphasized that number is just external foundry, right? Our internal business is what's going to be driving the factory build-out. That really gives us the scale to then start adding these additional external customers to it. Those deals, as we say, they could be a year or two, or they could be multiple years in length. There'll be a varying contract length associated with them. We just want to give some visibility and transparency to the business.\nA rapidly growing lifetime deal value is a good way for us to give you some characterization of that business outlook. Finally, I want to see you 21 February 2024. We're going to hold a big industry ecosystem event, our IFS Direct Connect, and meeting with the ecosystem, our customers. But we're inviting analysts to listen in to the great conversations we're going to have and the disclosures that we'll be giving there.\nThanks, Vivek. Jonathan, do you have time for one more question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our final question for today. And our final question for today comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\nC.J. Muse\n\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. I'll combine both my questions into one. Typically, in a manufacturing transition, you take on one, maybe two kind of technical challenges.\nHere at 18A, you're taking on backside power, gate-all-around, and High-NA. So we'd love to hear kind of maybe some of the struggles you've seen, how you've worked through them, and what kind of feedback you're getting from a customer in all three of those and kind of the confidence on delivering the goods in the timeline that you've set out. Thank you.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nVery good. So let me characterize a little bit more carefully because we've been trying to carefully manage the risks that we're taking on. So first was the move into EUV. We began that with Intel 4 and Intel 3. And those, as we said, are high-volume manufacturing underway, done. So we sort of took the risk of EUV off the table there. Backside power, right?\nWe ran an internal node, something we didn't disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many, many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to go de-risk backside power before we put it into Intel 20A and Intel 18A. So we had a major step to de-risk backside power. And then, of course, gate all around the transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and the gate all around transistor. But I'll tell you, as we've been going through the development process, backside power on 18A has been elegant, beautiful, high yield, and very clean in its introduction into the process. And really, the focus has been on the new transistor structure with gate all around. As customers are taking advantage of that now, as they're starting to look at that, they're really seeing great benefits from backside power.\nIn some cases, almost as much performance benefit and significant area benefit from that. Gate-All-Around transistors [are] making good progress, our 0.9 PDK that we delivered in Q4. We'll be having the 1.0 PDK in Q2 on track. As I said, Clearwater Forest is the first product, and it's now in the fab on 18A, a huge milestone for us, both on the product side as well as on the process side. High-NA, the next generation of EUV, is not part of 18A, right? That will be part of the next major node. We'll talk more about that at the Intel Foundry Day, as we said, on 21 February 2024. We're not introducing that as a risk factor into 18A. It's the EUV tools that are in production today that we've already de-risked as part of the Intel 4 and Intel 3.\nSo we think we've done a very careful management of risk. We look at this all the time as we're rebuilding our momentum. As I said, overall, we are confident Five Nodes in Four Years. This was audacious. It's been superbly executed. We are on track to deliver it and get back to process technology leadership for both our products as well as to establish a major foundry opportunity for the industry, rebuilding Western supply chains, the momentum we're seeing in our whole factory network. This is really incredible, the progress. I couldn't be proud of our team for getting it done. So with that, let me say thank you for joining us on the call, as always. We appreciate the opportunity that we have to update you on a strong Q4, beating on top and bottom line, finishing an incredible year in 2023.\nWe're just excited about the momentum we see across the business for both our products, our business and financial execution, the manufacturing technology, foundry design wins, really across the board. Our say-do ratio has been extremely high. We appreciate the interest. As I said, we look forward to the opportunity to give you some more updates as part of Foundry Direct Connect, 21 February 2024, in San Jose. I hope to see many of you there as we lay out an exciting update to the industry. It'll be a great day for us. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Intel Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\nAt this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 11 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, INTC.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner.\nIn a moment, we'll hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such, we're subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the culmination of a year of tremendous progress towards our IDM 2.0 transformation.\nWe consistently executed on our plan to reestablish process leadership, further build out our capacity and foundry plans, greatly improve product execution, and began to execute on our mission to bring AI everywhere across our product segments. We delivered solid Q4 results, exceeding expectations for the fourth quarter in a row. Revenue was at the higher end of our guidance, and we had strong EPS upside as a result of our ongoing relentless focus on driving operating leverage and expense management, including comfortably meeting our $3 billion cost savings commitment for fiscal year 2023. 2023 was definitely a year when we did what we said we would do and more. We intend to make 2024 another such year. When we look out over the next 12 months, we are confident that we can continue to drive considerable progress on our IDM 2.0 journey.\nAs we look into Q1, our core business, including client, server, and edge products, continues to perform well and is tracking to the lower end of seasonal. However, discrete headwinds, including Mobileye, PSG, and business exits, among others, are impacting overall revenue, leading to a lower Q1 guide. Importantly, we see this as temporary, and we expect sequential and year-on-year growth in both revenue and EPS for each quarter of fiscal year 2024. Momentum and excitement around new products and businesses remain strong as we head into the year and will grow stronger as the year progresses. We could not be prouder of the execution across our process technology roadmap in 2023. We became the world's first high-volume manufacturer of logic devices using EUV in both the US and Europe as we aggressively ramp Core Ultra on Intel 4 in both Oregon and Ireland.\nIntel 3 achieved manufacturing readiness in Q4 as committed with solid performance and yield progression. Our two lead vehicles in Intel 3 are on track, and we look forward to launching Sierra Forest in H1 2024, followed shortly thereafter by Granite Rapids. Sierra Forest has final samples at customers, and the production stepping of Granite Rapids is running ahead of schedule well into power-on validation and very healthy. We are even more excited about breaking into the Angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. We are first in industry to have incorporated both Gate-All-Around and Backside Power Delivery in a single process node. The latter is two years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle, will launch this year.\nIntel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in H2 2024, completing our five nodes and four-year journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A part for servers, has already gone into fab, and Panther Lake for clients will be heading into fab shortly. As we complete our goal of five nodes in four years, we are not satisfied, nor are we finished. We have begun installation of the industry's first high-NA EUV tool in our most advanced technology development site in Oregon, aimed at addressing challenges beyond 18A. We remain focused on being good stewards of Moore's Law and ensuring a continuous node migration path over the next decade and beyond. Third-party engagements with IFS continue to validate our progress on process technology.\nWe launched IFS with a long-term view of delivering the world's first system foundry that brings together a secure and sustainable supply chain with the best of Intel and our ecosystem. While our ambitions will not materialize overnight, we made tremendous progress in both Q4 and fiscal year 2023 towards our goal of becoming the second largest external foundry by 2030. The rapid adoption of AI by all industries is proving to be a significant tailwind for IFS as high-performance compute, an area where we have considerable wafer and packaging know-how and IP, is now one of the largest and fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor market. We made major strides in building our foundry ecosystem in 2023 with now over 40 strategic agreements across EDA, design services, IP, cloud, and U.S. military, aerospace, and government. Critical agreements with Arm and Synopsys continue to gain momentum.\nWe delivered the Intel 18A 0.9 PDK and broadened its availability in Q4. We expanded the RAMP-C program significantly and just this quarter signed a major foundry contract with the United States government and Department of Defense. We are also very pleased to have completed a major agreement with United Microelectronics, or UMC, to develop a 12-nanometer process platform targeting high-growth markets, including mobile communication infrastructure and networking. This expands both Intel and UMC's foundry process portfolios and customer access to a broader and more resilient supply, leveraging our Arizona site. This agreement builds upon and furthers our long and deep relationships with the vibrant Taiwan ecosystem. This also meaningfully extends the production life of our installed capacity and improves our returns on investments, similar to the announcement last quarter of our Tower Semiconductor partnership at the 65-nanometer node with our New Mexico site.\nOur success with IFS will be measured by customer commitments and revenue. We have taped out more than 75 ecosystem and customer test chips. IFS already has more than 50 test chips in the pipeline across 2024 and 2025, 75% of which are on Intel 18A. During CES, we welcomed Valens Semiconductor to the growing list of foundry customers as they announced they would use IFS to fabricate their MIPI A-PHY chipsets using our advanced technology. In addition to the three Intel 18A customers we disclosed in Q3, we won a key design win with a significant high-performance computing customer. This customer was particularly motivated by our unique leading-edge manufacturing capabilities and US capacity. We came into 2023 committing to one 18A foundry customer. We executed on four, inclusive of a meaningful prepay, and our momentum continues to grow.\nOur advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another important advantage for IFS, a faster on-ramp to broader foundry relationships. During the quarter, we captured three additional advanced packaging design wins, bringing the total to five in 2023, with the majority of revenue starting in 2025. To support our growing demand, just yesterday, we opened Fab 9 in New Mexico, marking a milestone for high-volume 3D advanced packaging manufacturing. The momentum advanced packaging is very strong and is another facet of our foundry strategy, which is clearly benefiting from the surge of interest in AI. With leadership technology and available capacity, our opportunity set continues to grow. In total, across wafer and advanced packaging, our lifetime deal value for IFS is now over $10 billion, a more than doubling from the $4 billion we provided in our last update.\nSupporting our growing momentum in IFS is our global manufacturing footprint. We are the only semiconductor company with that scale and sustainable manufacturing in every major region of the world, providing ourselves and our foundry customers resilient access to the right capacity in the right regions at the right time. All of our expansion projects in the US, EU, and Asia are progressing on schedule, and our CHIPS applications in the US and EU are progressing well. Finally, we are thrilled to be hosting our first Foundry Day IFS Direct Connect on 21 February 2024 in San Jose, where we will have the opportunity to showcase the breadth of our ecosystem as well as begin to talk about our process roadmap beyond Intel 18A, next-generation packaging, and our full foundry vision. We hope to see many of you there. Intel continues its mission to bring AI everywhere.\nWe see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. Given our foundry and product offerings, we're the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon Logic. We have already discussed how our 50-year heritage in high-performance computing transistors and our advanced packaging positions IFS to benefit from the accelerating move to AI. Within our product portfolio, we are the only company with the products, IP, and ecosystem reach to empower customers to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications, from the cloud through the network into the enterprise, client, and edge. For the developer working with multi-trillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provide a powerful combination of performance, competitive MLPerf benchmarks, and leadership TCO.\nAs AI proliferates and the world moves towards more AI-integrated applications, there's a market shift toward local inferencing and smaller, more nimble models. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to its cloud-based inferencing cost and round-trip latency. With AI-accelerated Xeon for enterprise, Core Ultra ushering in the AI PC era, and OpenVINO enabling developers' seamless and versatile support for a range of client and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than requiring it in the cloud. Our expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. In Q4, our server business experienced solid sequential growth, consistent with market share, which we believe was flat with Q3 levels.\nSince launching fourth-gen Xeon in early 2023, we have shipped more than 2.5 million units, with approximately 1/3 of all fourth-gen demand driven by AI. With our fifth-gen Xeon launch, we enable up to 42% higher AI inference performance compared to the industry-leading fourth-gen Xeon. Fifth-gen Xeon has reached general availability at Alibaba, is entering public and private previews with several CSPs, and is on track to ship with OEMs next month. More importantly, our improved execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen 4 and Gen 5 Xeon ramping well, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids coming soon, and Clearwater Forest already going into the fab. Momentum is building and positioning us well to win back share in the data center. Our Gaudi 2 AI accelerators continue to demonstrate price performance leadership compared to the most popular GPUs.\nIn a recent blog published by Databricks, Gaudi 2 was shown to clearly deliver the best training and inference performance per dollar based on public cloud pricing. We're building on this momentum with Gaudi 3, which is on track to launch this year and is expected to deliver performance leadership with 4x the processing power and double the networking bandwidth for greater scale-out performance. Gaudi 3 is now in the lab, powered on, and showing great health and performance, and Falcon Shores is also well underway. Our accelerator pipeline for 2024 grew double-digits sequentially in Q4 and is now well above $2 billion and growing. We recently increased our supply for both Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 to support the growing customer demand, and we expect meaningful revenue acceleration throughout the year. As we announced last quarter, we are now operating PSG as a standalone business beginning on 1 January.\nOur intent is to bring in private capital this year to create an eventual path to an IPO over the coming years. As we outlined on our Q3 call, PSG is in the midst of an industry-wide cyclical correction for FPGAs, which we expect to last through the first half of 2024. Despite the financial correction, operational momentum is strong, and PSG executed its most ambitious FPGA roadmap, delivering 21 new product releases in 2023 and executing supply assurance agreements valued by our customers. Finally, even as we congratulate Sandra Rivera, the new CEO of PSG, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Justin Hotard as Executive Vice President and General Manager of DCAI. Justin joined us from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where he was Executive Vice President and General Manager of High-Performance Computing, AI, and Labs.\nHe will play a key role in helping customers accelerate their businesses with our Xeon processor family, delivering on our commitments to customers and partners by increasing our GPU and accelerator footprint and supporting our mission to bring AI everywhere. Moving to client, CCG performed very well in Q4, posting the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth. Demand reflected a normalized inventory environment with sustained strength in gaming and commercial, with our highest-end SKUs exceeding Q3 records by 20%. The 2023 consumption TAM was roughly 270 million units, consistent with our views entering the year, and we expect the PC TAM up low single digits year-on-year in 2024, in line with third-party estimates. Our share position is strong, and our product portfolio for 2024 and beyond and ecosystem work will continue to drive industry-leading performance and experiences.\nIn Q4, we ushered in the age of the AI PC with the launch of Intel Core Ultra. Representing our largest architectural shift in decades, the Core Ultra is the most AI-capable and power-efficient client processor with dedicated acceleration capabilities across the CPU, GPU, and neural processing unit, or NPU. Ultra is the centerpiece of the AI PC, systems that are capable of natively running popular 10-billion-parameter models and drive superior performance on key AI-enhanced applications like Zoom, Adobe, and Microsoft. We expect to ship approximately 40 million AI PCs in 2024 alone, with more than 230 designs from ultra-thin PCs to handheld gaming devices to be delivered this year from OEM partners: Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, MSI, Samsung Electronics, and others. The Core Ultra platform delivers leadership AI performance today, with our next-generation platforms launching later this year, Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake tripling our AI performance.\nIn 2025, with Panther Lake, we will grow AI performance up to an additional 2x. NEX is well-positioned to benefit from the proliferation of AI workloads on the edge, where our market-leading hardware and software assets provide improved latency, reliability, and cost. OpenVINO adoption grew by 60% sequentially in Q4 and today is a core software layer for AI inferencing on the edge, on the PC, and in the data center. NEX is also driving the shift of AI networking in the cloud from proprietary technologies to open Ethernet-based approaches in partnership with a broader industry ecosystem. NEX Q4 results beat our internal forecast, and the division is poised for solid growth in 2024 across edge, network, and Ethernet products, more skewed to the second half. Yet another growing market opportunity for us is automotive.\nWhile Mobileye is experiencing a sharp inventory correction in Q1, we are encouraged by their improving forecast throughout 2024 and, more importantly, their recent announcement at CES that they were awarded a series of production design wins by a major Western automaker across the company's three key platforms: SuperVision, Chauffeur, and Drive. In addition to Mobileye's strengths in AV, at CES, we announced the launch of AI-enhanced software-defined vehicle SOCs with Geely Zeekr brand as our first OEM partner and our agreement to acquire Silicon Mobility, a fabless silicon and software company specializing in power management SOCs focused on EVs. These announcements build on shared IP across client and data center and our existing Intel SOC footprint of more than 50 million vehicles worldwide. Our strategy will continue to broaden our exposure to the growing auto market on both the product and the foundry sides of our business.\nFinally, underpinning our across-the-board progress in 2023 is our operational and financial discipline. As our new internal foundry model, which is designed to drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on cost, begins to take root, we expect to unlock further cost savings and efficiencies in 2024 and beyond. We have officially transitioned to this new operating model on 1 January 2024 and will report the new segmentation format as part of our Q1 earnings. We see incremental efficiencies as we drive to our long-term model of 60% gross and 40% operating margins. As I reflect on our progress in 2023, I am incredibly proud of our employees whose commitment and perseverance were instrumental to the execution of our ambitious strategy. Together, we exited the year accomplishing exactly what we set out to do. We improved our execution engine, consistently being on track or ahead on our process and product roadmap.\nAs I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are confident in our performance and financial trajectory for the year ahead. We know we have much work in front of us as we work to regain and build on our leadership position in every category in which we participate. We will maintain our relentless focus on our mission and commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn things over to Dave.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial results in the quarter on top of continued execution of our products and process roadmap commitments. We again beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin, and EPS. We've taken proactive steps to prioritize our investments, aggressively managed near-term expenses, and made meaningful progress on reducing our structural cost gaps.\nWe exit 2023 a healthier and leaner company, but there is much more work to do in 2024 and beyond to deliver on our long-term financial objectives and the potential of IDM 2.0. Fourth quarter revenue was $15.4 billion, up 9% sequentially, 10% year-over-year, and $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance, with solid execution across reported segments. Gross margin was 48.8%, 230 basis points better than our guidance, driven by favorable product mix and ASPs, improved unit costs, and higher revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.54, beating guidance by $0.10 on improved gross margins, stronger revenue, and disciplined OpEx management. Q4 operating cash flow was $4.6 billion. Net inventory was down more than $300 million in nine days in the quarter, and DSO remains under 20.\nNet CapEx was $5.9 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.3 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. Moving to the fourth quarter business unit results, CCG delivered revenue of $8.8 billion, up 12% sequentially, 33% year-over-year, and ahead of internal expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter. We saw sustained strength in gaming and commercial segments, along with record performance notebook shipments in the quarter. Customer inventory levels have normalized, and 2023 PC consumption was in line with our 270 million unit forecast. Operating profit was $2.9 billion, up more than $800 million sequentially, and nearly $2.4 billion year-over-year on improved TAM, market share, and sell-through of reserved inventory. DCAI revenue was $4 billion, up 4% sequentially. The server business delivered double-digit growth sequentially, partially offset by the FPGA inventory correction.\nRevenue was driven by improved unit TAM, stable share, and rising average core density contributing to record Xeon ASPs. Operating profit was $78 million, roughly flat sequentially, as advanced node development costs continued to weigh on profitability. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% sequentially, and ahead of internal expectations on strength from network and Ethernet segments. The business saw an operating loss of $12 million, down modestly quarter over quarter. Intel Foundry Services contributed revenue of $291 million, down modestly on a sequential basis, and up 63% year-over-year on increased traditional packaging revenue. IFS operating loss was $113 million, driven by continued investment to develop and grow world-class systems foundry. Mobileye delivered record revenue of $637 million, up 20% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, along with record operating profit of $242 million, up 42% sequentially and 15% year-over-year.\nRecently disclosed design wins are expected to contribute more than $7 billion of future revenue, or more than 3.5 times Mobileye's record FY23 revenue. As Pat summarized, the company made significant progress towards our IDM 2.0 strategy, including strong execution against our 2023 financial commitments despite macro headwinds throughout the year. As committed at our Q1 2023 earnings call, we delivered revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and EPS growth each quarter. Despite significant investments in future growth and continued progression through five nodes in four years, we achieved our 2023 commitment of $3 billion of spending reductions. Through a strong focus on cash and cost controls, we achieved excellent DSO and DPO in the second half of 2023 and delivered net inventory reductions of nearly $2 billion in 35 days from our peak in Q1 2023.\nWorking capital initiatives yielded roughly $2 billion of cash in 2023, helping us to meet our commitment for roughly break-even adjusted free cash flow in the second half of the year. We remain committed to our smart capital framework, with growing contributions from our SCIP agreement with Brookfield and progress toward government incentives in the US, Europe, and Israel. In Q4, we also recognized $845 million of advanced manufacturing investment credits, or AMIC, as defined in the CHIPS Act. While our continued IDM 2.0 capital investments will result in increased gross CapEx in 2024 as compared to 2023, we're on track to our aggregate 2023 through 2024 guidance of net CapEx spending in the mid-30s as a percent of revenue, with offsets towards the high end of the 20%-30% range. Now turning to Q1 guidance, we expect Q1 revenue of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion.\nAt the Q1 revenue midpoint of $12.7 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 44.5%, with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.13. While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG. Additionally, we expect a significant drop in IFS revenue after seeing accelerated purchasing in our traditional packaging business and cyclical weakness in wafer equipment buying in the first half of the year, impacting the IMS business. When combined with businesses we exited in 2023, we expect a roughly $1 billion sequential revenue impact from businesses outside of our core products. With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024, consistent with third-party views.\nOur recent results show the PC remains essential, and we remain confident in our longer-term TAM forecast as the age of the AI PC further enhances the value of device refresh. We expect Q1 data center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the data center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio with well over $2 billion in pipeline to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our network, Ethernet, and edge products.\nThese signals give us confidence that consolidated revenue will grow beyond typical seasonality after a soft Q1, and that we can deliver sequential and year-over-year growth in both revenue and EPS each quarter of 2024. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly break-even adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering five nodes in four years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion. We expect depreciation to grow by approximately $2 billion in 2024, in addition to a significant increase in variable factory startup costs. 60% gross margin flow-through as a percent of revenue growth remains a rule of thumb in aggregate in the intermediate term, though we may see volatility in our quarterly gross margin results.\nWe're excited to mark the first month fully operating under our new internal foundry reporting structure, with improved accountability, transparency around cost and value drivers, and increased focus on driving higher rates of return for our owners' capital. We intend to provide you with a recast historical financials this quarter in the form of an 8-K. We will unpack the details at that time, but you will see not only the first view of our manufacturing P&L, but a view of our products group more in line with external peers. While it will come as no surprise, our manufacturing P&L is under significant pressure as we get back to process leadership and build the infrastructure to meet both internal and external demand, we see abundant opportunity to drive improvement. Finally, standing up a separate legal entity for manufacturing, technology development, and IFS is important to our foundry customers.\nWe expect to have that structure in place in H2 2024. As we look back at 2023, we have a lot to be proud of. We entered the year with a challenging macro backdrop. I'm pleased with our team's efforts controlling spending, ramping new products, managing share, executing product and process roadmaps, and delivering for our customers. We continue to focus our portfolio by exiting five businesses in 2023, for a total of 10 since past return. While also identifying profitable adjacent markets, we can serve with our existing IP, as we have done with Intel Auto. We executed within our Smart Capital framework and are beginning to see meaningful capital offsets. We unlocked value for our shareholders through Mobileye and IMS, and announced our intention to pursue external investments in PSG.\nI'd like to thank the entire Intel team for the hard work and execution which drove our improved 2023 results. While we aren't yet where we want to be from a financial perspective, we're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM, our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market, and with the strong foundation of financial discipline we set in 2023, we're confident and committed to our long-term financial objectives. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nWe will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first question? Certainly. One moment for our first question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I have a near-term one, and then for my follow-up, it'll be a longer-term one. So the near-term one is on the demand picture. Dave, you were helpful in breaking out the kind of the non-core impacts in the first quarter versus the core, but the low end of seasonality is a little bit of a surprise, given that cyclical pressures seem to have been abating, and some of the market share trends should have been going in your favor, at least also not worsening. So can you just talk a little bit about why you're at the low end of seasonality in the first quarter for your core businesses and what gives you confidence in super seasonality thereafter?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks, Ross. I'll start and ask Dave to follow up. And first, what's seasonality Q4 to Q1?\nThere's a wide range of perspectives, anywhere from 3%-20% historically. So I'll just say it's a wide statement of what that looks like. Obviously, as we come into the year, it's coming off a very strong Q4. Our product lines are strong. We feel our inventory positions are healthy. We're gaining momentum across it. And obviously, we've built a forecast consistent with our customers and channel partners that we believe is merited. Obviously, Dave talked about some of the discrete events, which as we added them up, were a little bit larger than we forecast, but the core business we see is healthy. For it, we see no areas for market share loss, and the products are getting stronger.\nSo we'll say it really reflects as we view the market, but we've also said, hey, we're improving every quarter as we go through the year, improving on revenue, top line, improving on profitability as we go through the year, and we've quite scrutinized that outlook for the year. And obviously, as the year improves, new product lines emerging, tailwinds in areas like AI PC, Gaudi ramping for accelerators. Overall, a lot of things that just keep improving as we go through the year, combined with good cost discipline. We feel quite comfortable that we're starting strong, and we're going to have an improving year as the year progresses. And what's the long-term question, Ross?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThe confidence in, oh, the second half. The long-term question is one, yeah, sorry. The long-term question is one on the manufacturing nodes. The five nodes in four years is going well, but one of your biggest foundry, well, customers and competitors is doubling down on their ability to keep the leadership positioning. So what gives you confidence that 18A will, in fact, have the leadership node? And how do we reconcile the fact that you seem to be using that customer as a foundry partner for some of your heterogeneous products, whether it be Arrow Lake or Lunar Lake going forward? If you have the leadership, why wouldn't you be doing that internally?\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you. I'll do that and ask Dave to pile on both of those a little bit. But with respect to the manufacturing, I'll just say, hey, we look at this every single day, and we're scrutinizing carefully our progress on 18A.\nObviously, the great news that we just described, those Clearwater Forest tape outs, and that gives us a lot of confidence that 18A is healthy. That's a major product for us. Panther Lake following that shortly. We've also had our fourth customer this quarter. Some of the IP providers are giving us very strong affirmations on the competitiveness of the process technology. And particularly, we're just way ahead on backside power. And that's not even everybody in the industry is recognizing that, and many of the customers who are looking at it are seeing substantial gains, not just in power performance, but in area savings as well. So overall, we feel very confident that our roadmap is strong on the process technology side. We do use external foundries, and obviously, that grew as we were dealing with some of our own challenges for process competitiveness.\nAs we create more and more focus in the business, more wafers will come internal to the Intel factory network. But long-term, we're going to continue to use external foundries to complement, manage our capital requirements, and to make sure that our teams always are building the best products in the industry and using the best technologies to accomplish that. So overall, we feel super good with our strategy. You'll see more use of our own factory network, even as we leverage external foundries where appropriate. The only other thing I'd add is just the use of external foundries as part of our Smart Capital strategy. It's one of the five pillars. So as Pat said, that will continue to be part of our strategy. Obviously, we're going to maximize how much we can do internally, but we're always going to be using external foundries based on Smart Capital.\nThanks, Ross. Jonathan, the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I had a question about gross margin. It was obviously much, much better in December, and the March guidance is actually pretty good. So does this include the sale of any previously written down inventory and maybe help us get a clean margin number? Is this March number pretty clean that we can carry that incremental forward through the year?\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. I mean, what I said in the prepared remarks, I think, is that we think that a 60% fall-through is probably the best rule of thumb. That said, as you know, quarter to quarter, things can move that number up and down. In Q4, we saw better fall-through.\nLargely, it was related to better sell-through of previously reserved product. We also actually did better on the factory side in terms of spending and yield, and so that also benefited us to some extent. And then in Q1, I think we're going to do a little worse. We're going to see the fall-through be a little harder on us. And largely, that's some of that stuff going away a little bit. But I think if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, kind of a 2023-2024, 2024- 2025, we'd largely expect it to be this 60% fall-through. We're going to have these quarter to quarter movements that kind of violate that because of just one-off things. But I think in general, you'll see 60% fall-through be the right measure.\nLonger term, we're obviously going to want to see that number go up because it's going to drive us to the 60% gross margins we ultimately want to attain. But in the near term, we're kind of dealing with a lot of the costs associated with five nodes in four years. It's just a lot of startup costs back. We'll probably hit our peak startup cost in 2024. So that's a huge headwind we'll have to deal with. So that's going to, I think, kind of keep us in this 60% fall-through range for the next couple of years.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a follow-up question? I do. I do, Dave. Yeah. Just on how you get to that 60%. So it seems like there could be persistent headwinds in terms of capacity utilization.\nI mean, I think a lot of us see that there's this plan to cut over to internal, starting with Panther Lake, but that doesn't really ramp into high volume until probably 2026. So are you managing to some sort of utilization rate for your internal capacity to sort of get to that 60%? Thanks.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, maybe step back a little bit on the 60%. I mean, it will be driven by a number of factors, one of which is just revenue. Revenue growing on a largely fixed-cost business is going to help gross margins. Obviously, we have optimism around how we can drive the growth of the business. The second, as you point out, is loadings. And we are managing our capital spend and our investment with an eye on loadings to make sure that we keep those in a good place.\nObviously, last year, we had some underloadings to deal with. But as we kind of break out of that and start to move into the next year, I think we'll start to see some improvements there. Third, as we get, as Pat was talking about, to leadership in terms of nodes and products, ultimately across the entire product portfolio, that's going to help out on margins. It's going to help out from a cost structure perspective, but also better-performing products are just going to yield better pricing and so forth, better profitability. And then lastly, we've got this internal foundry model that Pat mentioned, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that we think is going to deliver just tons of savings for the company.\nI think every week that Pat and I spend on this, somebody brings up another big rock that they found of savings they can identify because they are looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, what sort of hotlots they do, and how much sample activity they use. The factory is now, as you point out, very, very hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investments associated with the loadings. We're way more focused in terms of steppings and so forth. So I think we'll get, like I said in a call a couple of quarters ago, $4 billion-$5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nSo that's another big step function that I think gets us to the 60% gross margins. I'd also add things like we just announced with UMC, right? We're taking older factories. And as Tim, as you might have heard me say in the past, right, a bug in the Intel business model, right? Just when a factory got very good and depreciated, right, we moved to the next node. Well, now we're starting to fill that with long-term foundry business as well. So all of these are improving the discipline of running the business as well as how we utilize our factory networks long-term. And we really do think that the 60/40 is what Dave and I are driving the business to, and we're going to get there. Thanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question.\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYour question, please. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the data center decline in Q1. How much of that is a function of the weakness in FPGAs that you've talked about already, and then just any sense of what the cloud and server environment is like in the first quarter?\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation",
    "content3": "Yeah. So overall, when you factor, obviously, we've spoken separately about the FPGA business, so let's just move that to the side. Overall, I'll say it's fairly seasonal, quarter to quarter, in what we expect. That said, we're seeing strength from our server customers. For instance, more of the OEM response is strong with regard to the momentum they're seeing in the enterprise server business. And obviously, our product line is improving there. We do expect year-on-year growth here.\nWe see our market share stabilizing. Obviously, as we're ramping Gen 4, Gen 5, Granite Rapids, Sierra Forest, the momentum is building for us overall. As we indicated, hey, we think more of the AI surge is going to result in AI inferencing on-prem, which we're well-positioned to be a beneficiary of. I would just cite that here we are in year 20 of the public cloud, and you have 60%+ of compute in the cloud, but 80+% of data remains on-prem. Customers want to realize the value of that on-prem data with AI, and that's an enterprise strength for Intel. So we do see all of these trends giving us a very favorable outlook for the year. There's nothing surprising about the Q1 guide here, and we're going to be very focused on beating those numbers and building on the momentum of improving product line.\nJoe, do you have a follow-up question?\nYeah, I do. Along the same lines, can you talk about Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids? And I guess, how do you see the long-term mix between those? What kind of appetite do you see for the Sierra Forest kind of higher core count designs?\nYeah. Thank you. And I would love to talk for hours about Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. I am super excited about those products, both of them on Intel 3. And if I build on the last question from Tim about factory loadings, hey, we are driving hard to accelerate those products into the marketplace, and they're really the drivers of Intel 3 capacity. The mix between them, obviously, this is our first, I'll say, volume, mainstream offering for a high core count.\nI sort of view this as the cloud guys just run VMs at scale or just run containers at scale. That's what Sierra Forest is about, is sort of that bulk workload. And it doesn't have some of the performance capabilities, peak capabilities, feature capabilities that Granite Rapids has. I expect the bulk of the market to stay on Granite Rapids-type products, the P-core products, certainly in 2024 and 2025. But we do see a pretty steady rise in the use of Sierra Forest. And then as we move to Clearwater Forest in 2025, a very compelling product. We do see a pretty healthy split between those for the cloud and data center customers. I think most of the enterprise customers will stay with the P-core products that they will have.\nIt really is Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest, and successors being sort of that bulk mainstream cloud offering that's very focused on TCO. So with that, we feel super good about our product portfolio, P-cores, E-cores, really allowing us to stretch the offering to the highest performance with high core count and to the best TCO. And with that, this is a portfolio that will allow us to regain share in the core data center market. Thanks, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please? Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your question, please. Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. I wanted to revisit the gross margins, and I appreciate the 60% fall-through comment that we should use as a rule of thumb.\nBut Dave, starting at 44.5 in Q1, are you still looking for the overall reported non-GAAP number to be up year-over-year from the 43.6? And you mentioned some volatility there. I just want to clarify on the call how the gross margin trajectory is going to look year-over-year, and understanding there's that volatility there. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. To be clear, the way I was looking at gross margins is on a year-over-year basis on this 60% fall-through. So you should take the full-year gross margins that we had in 2023, which were roughly 43.5%, and think about this 60% fall-through based on the 43.6% gross margins. I think when you do that, we obviously start off at a level that's better on a year-over-year basis, but obviously down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And so you should expect generally improving dynamics through the year.\nThe only challenge will be this quarter-to-quarter always has volatility to it. So there could be quarters in which we get less ship-through of previously reserved products. Sometimes it's more. And so I'm kind of avoiding trying to pinpoint every quarter because of the difficulty around pinpointing that. But we feel very confident around the 60% fall-through. Ben, do you have a follow-up?\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thanks, John. Could you talk a little bit more about the client market? You mentioned that corporate, you said some strength, and Dell, it said there was some weakness. And heading into the first quarter, can you talk about the revenues on client and what makes you so confident that it's really going to pick up? Thanks.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. So as we look at the market year-on-year, we expect it to be a few points bigger than it was last year. So last year was 270.\nThis year, a couple of points higher than that. I think that's consistent with the various market forecasters that we have. Our market share position is very stable. We had good execution on market share through last year. The product line is better this year with a number of tailwinds, like we said. So overall, we think it's going to be a very solid year for us in our client business. Obviously, as we start the year, everybody is, I'll say, managing through what their Q1 outlook looks like, even as they expect to see stronger business as we go through the year. I'd also comment, Ben, that some of these tailwinds really only start to materialize as you go into second quarter and second half. AI PC is just ramping right now. The Windows 10 EOS goes into effect, and customers are starting to look at the post-COVID refreshes.\nSo a lot of those benefits materialize as you go through the year, but our position in gaming, commercial, very strong for us overall. And I'll tell you, we're just seeing a lot of excitement for the AIPC. I describe this as the Centrino moment, the most exciting category-defining moment since Wi-Fi was introduced two-plus decades ago. So we do think that it's going to bring a multi-year cycle of growth, great ISVs, great new use cases, and a product line that is clearly leading the industry, establishing this category.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please. So thanks for taking my question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nPat, I'm curious now that we are a year into the generative AI deployments. What's your view on how cloud customers are thinking about the CapEx between traditional and AI servers? Because when we look at the revenue growth across your GPU competitors, they seem to be capturing nearly all of the incremental CapEx and in some cases even more than, right, just the CapEx of the public cloud company. So does that really leave much room for your CPU business to grow right beyond just the seasonal variations? So just how are you looking at the AI market overall, and what part of that is Intel really able to capture when we just look at how much is being or needing to be dedicated to your GPU competitors?\nYeah. Thank you. And let's just maybe three different aspects to it.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThe first one is clearly the high-end cloud guys and what they're doing for maximizing training environments. Clearly, that's been an accelerator market so far. But that even is giving, I'll say, a bit of a tailwind in the sense there are lots of head nodes associated with that. We do think, as we said, that the market moves much more from high-end training to inference where our product line is more substantive for it. But the enterprise market, as we see it for data centers, is very much going to be an on-premise play, taking advantage of inference and that data pools that they already have. And that's an area of good strength for Intel. And we're starting to see that in some of the conversations with our OEM customers.\nAs I finished probably 50 meetings between World Economic Forum and Davos and CES with customers, I'll say we have absolute unanimous response that they're going to be deploying a lot of their AI on-premise in their data centers. Xeons and our on-premise offerings are simply the preferred way for them to be taking advantage of those capabilities inside of their data centers, inside of the TCO envelopes, power, networking, and management that they have in place. Obviously, we need to be participating more in the accelerator piece of that. We're seeing the growing pipeline of our opportunities. We saw a nice uptick in revenue in Q4 from a small number, but a lot of momentum as we come into the year. Gaudi 3 is getting a lot of excitement, clearly leading in TCO. So we're going to be competing much more for that high-end accelerator footprint.\nBut I think the message of 2024 is going to be inferencing, AI everywhere. That's going to be at the edge. That's going to be the AI PC, and it's going to be in the enterprise data center, all areas that Intel has a much stronger footprint. Vivek, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes. Thank you, John. Thank you, Pat. Also on the foundry side, I think you mentioned IFS, some declines in Q1 after the strong Q4 that you had. So I was hoping if you could just help us size what is IFS in Q1. And then longer term, you mentioned now you have four 18A wins. But how do we quantify what they mean for 2024 or 2025 or 2026? And I think on the call, you had mentioned somewhere about $10 billion in lifetime wins. I'm hoping that that's what you meant for 18A.\nBut when I look at that $10 billion over multiple years, that is not really that big relative to, I think, the 130 billion-plus annual foundry market. So could you just help us size what does Intel's external foundry business mean for a 2024 or 2025 perspective?\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you. Yeah. And the two things in the Q4 to Q1 numbers on IFS. One is, I'll say, the natural ending of our traditional packaging volume. So that affects Q4 as we go into Q1. And obviously, our focus there isn't doing, I'll say, traditional packaging. That's best supplied by OSAT vendors. But we were in a unique position to help our customers as we went through the COVID cycle. All of our packaging focus going forward is advanced packaging, where our technology is differentiated, the margins are good.\nAs you saw, we just announced the New Mexico facility as the first major advanced manufacturing facility on US soil. A lot of excitement from that from customers across the world. Also, we had our foundry equipment business, which was another factor, Q4 to Q1, very consistent with the profile that you might have heard from people like ASML, right, as they saw the quarter-to-quarter implications on the equipment business. So I'll say Q4 to Q1, all explainable in those contexts. The business we're winning, 18A foundry customers, Intel 3 packaging, it takes quarters for that to materialize, and for wafer customers, years. And that's why we said lifetime deal value is probably the best metric that we can give you to help you understand the nature of that business as it's growing. As I said, we saw a big uptick from our prior update to this one.\nObviously, we need to, as your question suggests, get to a much bigger number. That's exactly what we're going to do. We're now well underway. We're seeing healthy growth in lifetime deal value. We'll be giving you periodic updates on it as a good metric of seeing how rapidly that business is growing for us. I've emphasized that number is just external foundry, right? Our internal business is what's going to be driving the factory build-out. That really gives us the scale to then start adding these additional external customers to it. Those deals, as we say, they could be a year or two, or they could be multiple years in length. There'll be a varying contract length associated with them. We just want to give some visibility, transparency to the business.\nA rapidly growing lifetime deal value is a good way for us to give you some characterization of that business outlook. Finally, I want to see you 21 February. We're going to hold a big industry ecosystem event, our IFS Direct Connect, and meeting with the ecosystem, our customers. But we're inviting analysts to listen in to the great conversations we're going to have and the disclosures that we'll be giving there. Thanks, Vivek. Jonathan, do you have time for one more question, please? Certainly. One moment for our final question for today. Our final question for today comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. I'll combine both my questions into one. Typically, in a manufacturing transition, you take on one, maybe two kind of technical challenges.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nHere at 18A, you're taking on backside power, gate all around, and high NA. So we'd love to hear kind of maybe some of the struggles you've seen, how you've worked through them, and what kind of feedback you're getting from a customer in all three of those and kind of the confidence on delivering the goods in the timeline that you've set out. Thank you. Very good. So let me characterize a little bit more carefully because we've been trying to carefully manage the risks that we're taking on. So first was the move into EUV. We began that with Intel 4 and Intel 3. And those, as we said, are high-volume manufacturing underway, done. So we sort of took the risk of EUV off the table there. Backside power, right?\nWe ran an internal node, something we didn't disclose to external foundry customers, but we ran many, many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to go de-risk backside power before we put it into Intel 20A and Intel 18A. So we had a major step to de-risk backside power. And then, of course, gate all around the transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and the gate all around transistor. But I'll tell you, as we've been going through the development process, backside power on 18A has been elegant, beautiful, high yield, and very clean in its introduction into the process. And really, the focus has been on the new transistor structure with gate all around. As customers are taking advantage of that now, as they're starting to look at that, they're really seeing great benefits from backside power.\nIn some cases, almost as much performance benefit and significant area benefit from that. Gate-All-Around transistors making good progress are 0.9 PDK that we delivered in Q4. We'll be having the 1.0 PDK in Q2 on track. As I said, Clearwater Forest is the first product, and it's now in the fab on 18A, a huge milestone for us, both on the product side as well as on the process side. High-NA, the next generation of EUV, is not part of 18A, right? That will be part of the next major node. We'll talk more about that at the Intel Foundry Day, as we said, on 21 February 2024. We're not introducing that as a risk factor into 18A. It's the EUV tools that are in production today that we've already de-risked as part of the Intel 4 and Intel 3.\nSo we think we've done a very careful management of risk. And we look at this all the time as we're rebuilding our momentum. And as I said, overall, we are confident five nodes in four years. This was audacious. It's been superbly executed, and we are on track to deliver it and get back to process technology leadership for both our products as well as to establish a major foundry opportunity for the industry, rebuilding Western supply chains, the momentum we're seeing in our whole factory network. This is really incredible, the progress. And I couldn't be proud of our team for getting it done. So with that, let me say thank you for joining us on the call, as always. We appreciate the opportunity that we have to update you on a strong Q4 beating on top and bottom line, finishing an incredible year in 2023.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nWe're just excited about the momentum we see across the business for both our products, our business and financial execution, the manufacturing technology, foundry design wins, really across the board. Our say-do ratio has been extremely high. We appreciate the interest. As I said, we look forward to the opportunity to give you some more updates as part of Foundry Direct Connect, 21 February in San Jose. I hope to see many of you there as we lay out an exciting update to the industry. It'll be a great day for us. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com, for those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO Pat Gelsinger and our CFO David Zinsner. In a moment you will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such they are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nThey also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate, to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you John and good afternoon everyone. Before we begin, given our significant and now almost 50-year presence in Israel, we are deeply saddened by the recent attacks and their impact on the region. Our utmost priority is the safety and welfare of our people in Israel and their families. I also want to recognize the resilience of our teams as they have kept our operations running and our factory expansion progressing. Our thoughts are with all of those affected by the war and I am praying for a swift return to peace.\nTurning to our results, we delivered an outstanding Q3, beating expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was above the high end of our guidance and EPS benefited from both strong operating leverage and expense discipline. More important than our standout financial performance were the key operational milestones we achieved in the quarter across process and products, Intel Foundry Services, and our strategy to bring AI everywhere. Simply put, this quarter demonstrates the meaningful progress we have made towards our IDM 2.0 transformation.\nThe foundation of our strategy is re-establishing transistor power and performance leadership. While many thought our ambitions were a bit audacious when we began our five nodes and four-year journey roughly two and a half years ago, we have increasing line of sight towards achieving our goal. Intel 7 is done with nearly 150 million units in aggregate of Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids already in the market. In addition, Emerald Rapids has achieved product release and began shipping this month.\nIn Q3 we began initial shipments of Meteor Lake on Intel 4, which we are now aggressively ramping on the most productive fleet of EUV tools in the industry, providing us with a greater than 20% capital efficiency advantage compared to when EUV tools were first launched. High-volume EUV manufacturing is well underway in Oregon and more recently in Ireland. Our Fab 34 in Ireland represents the first high-volume EUV production in Europe, underscoring our commitment to establish geographically diverse and resilient supply. We are the only leading-edge semiconductor manufacturer at scale in every major region of the globe.\nOur Intel 3 process is tracking to be manufacturing ready by year-end, supporting our first two Intel 3 products, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. In fact, our production stepping of Sierra Forest is already out of fab and what we expect to be the production stepping of Granite Rapids has already taped in and is in the fab now.\nWe are particularly excited by our move into the angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. Adding to our accelerating adoption of EUV are two key new innovations, RibbonFET and PowerVia, representing the first fundamental change to the transistor and process architecture since we commercialized FinFET in 2012. I have been studying SEM diagrams for almost 40 years. RibbonFET and PowerVia are true works of art, the most exquisite transistors ever created. We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness on Intel 20A in the first half of 2024. Arrow Lake, our lead product on 20A, is already running Windows and demonstrating excellent functionality.\nEven more significant, we hit a critical milestone on Intel 18A with the 0.9 release of the PDK with imminent availability to external customers. In simple terms, the invention phase of RibbonFET and PowerVia is now complete and we are racing towards production-ready industry-leading process technology. Our first products on Intel 18A will go into fab on schedule in Q1 2024. With Clearwater Forest for servers, Panther Lake for clients, and of course a growing number of IFS test chips, we expect to achieve manufacturing readiness for Intel 18A in second half 2024 completing our incredible five nodes in four years journey on or ahead of schedule.\nWhile Intel 18A re-establishes transistor leadership, we are racing to increase that lead. We announced at Innovation our plans to lead the industry in a move to glass substrate for high-density performance and unique optical capabilities. We also announced our plans to begin installation of the world's first High NA EUV tool for commercial use by the end of the year to continue our modernizations and infrastructure expansions of our Gordon Moore Park in Oregon, home of our technology development team.\nMoore's Law continues to be the foundational driver of semiconductor technology and economics, which in turn fuels broader innovation in every industry across the globe. We remain committed to be good stewards of Moore's Law and drive advancements until we have exhausted every element on the periodic table.\nImportantly, our progress on process technology is now being well validated by third parties. We have made great progress with early IFS customers this quarter, which we expect to only accelerate with the release of the 0.9 PDK for Intel 18A, a major customer committed to Intel 18A and Intel 3, which includes a meaningful prepayment that expedites and expands our capacity corridor for this customer. The customer is seeing particularly good power performance and area efficiency in their design.\nThis opportunity is very significant and highlights our full systems foundry capabilities in high performance computing, big die designs, leadership performance, and area efficient transistors, advanced packaging, and systems expertise. In addition, we are extremely pleased to announce today that we have signed with two additional 18A customers. Both are particularly focused in areas of high performance compute and benefiting from power performance per unit silicon area. We have also made substantial progress with our next major customer and are expecting to conclude commercial contract negotiations before year end.\nFinally, we were also very happy to expand our growing foundry ecosystem by completing our strategic partnership with Synopsys in Q3 to include IP for Intel 3 and Intel 18A for both Intel internal and external foundry customers. With the rise of AI and high performance computing applications, our advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another unique advantage. We have seen a surge of interest in our advanced packaging from most leading AI chip companies. With capacity corridors quickly available, this is proving to be a significant accelerant and on ramp for Intel Foundry customers.\nDuring the quarter we were awarded two customer AI designs for our advanced packaging and with an additional six customers in active negotiations, we expect several more awards by year end. We have also established an important business relationship with Tower Semiconductor utilizing our manufacturing assets in New Mexico along with tower investing capital expenditures of roughly $300 million for its use in this facility. This represents an important step in our foundry strategy, improving cash flows by utilizing our manufacturing assets over a significantly longer period of time.\nFinally, we have submitted all four of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, representing over $100 billion of US manufacturing and research investments to the CHIPS Program Office, and are working closely with them as they review these proposals. We look forward to providing a deeper update on our Foundry business during our planned IFS industry event in Q1 of 2024.\nWe are on a mission to bring AI everywhere. We see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. We are empowering the market to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications. For the developer working with multi-trillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance competitive MLPerf benchmarks and a very cost efficient TCO. However, as the world moves toward more AI-integrated applications, there's a market shift towards local inferencing.\nIt's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inference cost. With AI-accelerated Xeon for Enterprise, Core Ultra launching the AI PC generation, and OpenVINO enabling developers seamless and versatile support for a range of client and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than forcing it into the cloud.\nOur expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. The AI continuum enables AI everywhere. DCAI exceeded our forecast this quarter. With server revenue up modestly sequentially, we continue to see a strong ramp of our 4th-gen Xeon processor. With the world's top 10 CSPs now in general availability and improving strength from MNCs.\nDuring the quarter, we shipped our 1 millionth 4th-gen Xeon unit and are on track to surpass 2 million units next month. 4th Gen Xeon includes powerful accelerators demonstrating best-in-class CPU performance for AI, security, and networking workloads. Our AI-enhanced Xeons are primed for model inferencing, enabling seamless infusion of AI into existing workloads. This was visible this quarter with over 1/3 of 4th Gen Xeon shipments directly related to AI applications.\nWe are the clear leader in AI CPU results as seen in MLCommons benchmarks today, and our roadmap provides significant further improvements with Granite Rapids expected to deliver an additional 2-3x AI performance on top of our industry-leading 4th Gen Xeon.\nWe continue to make excellent progress with our Xeon roadmap. Our 5th Gen Xeon processor codenamed Emerald Rapids is in production and ramping to customers and will officially launch on 14 December in New York City. Sierra Forest, our first E-core Xeon, is on track for H1 2024 with customers well into their validation process. Sierra Forest will feature up to 288 E-cores targeting next-generation cloud-native workloads delivering even more price performance and power efficiency for our customers. Granite Rapids, which shortly follows Sierra Forest, is also well into our validation cycle with customers.\nWhile the industry has seen some wallet share shifts between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters as well as some inventory burn in the server market, we see signs of normalization as we enter Q4, driving modest sequential TAM growth across most customers. We expect to exit the year at healthy inventory levels and we see growth in compute cores returning to more normal historical rates off a depressed 2023. More importantly, our successful roadmap execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen4 and Gen5 Xeon, Sierra Forest, and Granite Rapids positioning us well to win back share in the data center.\nIn addition, we expect to capture a growing portion of the accelerator market in 2024 with our suite of AI accelerators led by Gaudi, which is setting leadership benchmark results with third parties like MLCommons and Hugging Face. We are pleased with the customer momentum we are seeing from our accelerator portfolio and Gaudi in particular, and we have nearly doubled our pipeline over the last 90 days. As we look to 2024 like many others, we now are focused on having enough supply to meet our growing demand.\nDell is partnering with us to deliver Gaudi for cloud and enterprise customers with its next generation PowerEdge systems featuring Xeon and Gaudi AI accelerators to support AI workloads ranging from large scale training to inferencing at the edge. Together with Stability AI, we are building one of the world's largest AI supercomputers entirely in 4th-gen Xeon processors and 4,000 Intel Gaudi 2 AI accelerators. Our Gaudi roadmap remains on track with Gaudi 3 out of the fab now in packaging and expected to launch next year. In 2025, Falcon Shores brings our GPU and Gaudi capabilities into a single product.\nMoving to the client, CCG delivered another strong quarter, exceeding expectations for the third consecutive quarter, driven by strength in commercial and consumer gaming SKUs, where we are delivering leadership performance as we expected customers completed their inventory burn in the first half of the year, driving solid sequential growth, which we expect will continue into Q4. We expect full year 2023 PC consumption to be in line with our Q1 expectations of approximately 270 million units. In the near term, we expect Windows 10 end of service to be a tailwind, and we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PC TAM returning to ±300 million units.\nIntel continues to be a pioneer in the industry as we ushered in the era of the AI PC in Q3 when we released the Intel Core Ultra processor codenamed Meteor Lake. Built on Intel 4, the Intel Core Ultra has been shipping to customers for several weeks and will officially launch on 14 December alongside our 5th-gen Xeon. The Ultra represents the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology, delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance. It is also the first Intel client processor to feature our Integrated Neural Processing Unit or NPU that enables dedicated low power compute for AI workloads.\nNext year we will deliver Arrow Lake as well as Lunar Lake, which offers our next-gen NPU, ultra-low-power mobility, and breakthrough performance per watt. Panther Lake, our 2025 client offering, heads into the fab in Q1 2024 on Intel 18A. The arrival of the AI PC represents an inflection point in the PC industry not seen since we first introduced Centrino in 2003. Centrino was so successful because of our time to market advantage, our embrace of an open ecosystem, strong OEM partnerships, our performance silicon, and our developer scale. Not only are these same advantages in place today, they are even stronger as we enter the age of the AI PC.\nWe are catalyzing this moment with our AI PC Acceleration Program with over 100 ISVs already participating, providing access to Intel's deep bench of engineering talent for targeted software optimization, core development tools, and go-to-market opportunities. We are encouraged and motivated by our partners and competitors who see the tremendous growth potential of the PC market.\nNEX is also seeing early signs of the benefits from growing AI use cases. Our Ethernet and IPU businesses are well suited to support the high I/O bandwidth required by AI workloads in the data center, with growth expected to accelerate for both in 2024. Additionally, at the Edge, as part of Intel's focus on every aspect of the AI Continuum, NEX launched OpenVINO 2023.1, the latest version of the AI inferencing and deployment runtime of choice for developers on client and Edge platforms with AI, I/O, and Fit:match, demonstrating how they use OpenVINO to accelerate their applications at our Innovation conference.\nWe have leadership developer software tool chains that have seen a doubling of developer engagements this year. While NEX entered their inventory correction after client and DCAI Q3 results beat our internal forecast and grew sequentially, we see continued signs of stabilization heading into Q4.\nFinally, our smart capital strategy underpins our relentless drive for efficiency and our commitment to be great allocators of our owners' capital while consistently looking for innovative ways to unlock value for all our stakeholders. We remain on track to reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023, and we continue to see significant incremental opportunities for operational improvement as we execute on our internal foundry model.\nIn addition, in Q3 we made the decision to divest the pluggable module portion of our silicon photonics business, allowing us to focus on the higher value component business and optical I/O solutions to enable AI infrastructure scaling. This marks the tenth business we have exited in the last two and a half years, generating $1.8 billion in annual savings and a testament to our efforts to optimize our portfolio and drive long-term value creation.\nMobileye's solid Q3 and Q4 outlook continue to underscore the benefits of increased autonomy afforded by our initial public offering last year. In addition, we added TSMC as a minority investor in our IMS Nanofabrication business in Q3, and earlier this month we announced our plans to operate PSG as a standalone business beginning 1 January 2024. Similar to Mobileye and IMS, this decision gives PSG the mandate, focus, and resources to better capitalize on their growth opportunities. We plan to report PSG results as a standalone segment in Q1 to bring in private investors in 2024 and to create a path to an initial public offering over the next two to three years.\nIn summary, we continue to deliver tangible progress 2.5 years into our transformation journey. We are on track with five nodes in four years, we are hitting or beating all our product roadmap milestones, we are establishing ourselves as a global at scale systems foundry for both wafer processing and advanced packaging. We are unlocking new growth opportunities fueled by AI, and we are driving financial discipline and operational efficiencies as we continue to unlock value for our shareholders.\nWhile we are encouraged by our progress to date, we know we have much more work in front of us as we continue to relentlessly drive forward with our strategy, maintain our execution momentum, and deliver our commitments to our customers. I'd like to personally thank the Intel family for all their efforts. With that, let me turn it over to Dave to go through our results in more detail and provide guidance for Q4.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you Pat and good afternoon everyone. We delivered another strong quarter financially on top of outstanding execution on our product and process roadmaps as we continue to drive our IDM 2.0 transformation. We beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin, and EPS while we continue to monitor economic indicators and geopolitical risks. We're pleased with the momentum and health of our business and we'll continue to focus on prioritizing our investments prudently and aggressively, managing near term expenses, and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term.\nQ3 revenue was $14.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and $750 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations across all major lines of business. Gross margin was 45.8%, 280 basis points better than our guidance, driven by higher revenue and ASPs, and better sell through of previously reserved inventory. EPS for the quarter was $0.41, beating guidance by $0.21 as our revenue strength, improving gross margins, and disciplined OpEx management resulted in sequential EPS growth of $0.28. Q3 operating cash flow was $5.8 billion, up $3 billion sequentially. Net inventory was down $500 million or seven days in the quarter.\nWe also significantly improved the linearity of our shipments, which brought DSO down by five days. In total, our working capital improvement initiatives have yielded more than $2 billion of cash year to date. Net CapEx was $4.9 billion, resulting in positive adjusted free cash flow of approximately $950 million, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter.\nIn Q3, we announced the sale of 10% of our IMS Nanofabrication business to TSMC following the investment from Bain Capital in June. When combined with the Mobileye IPO, these transactions have unlocked more than $30 billion of value. Earlier this month we signaled our intent to pursue private investment and ultimately an IPO for our PSG business as we continue to pursue opportunities to increase value for our shareholders.\nMoving to Q3 business unit results, CCG delivered revenue of $7.9 billion, up 16% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Customer inventory levels are healthy and the market remains on track to our January consumption TAM signal of roughly 270 million units for 2023. CCG's operating profit doubled sequentially to $2.1 billion on higher revenue sell through of reserved inventory and stronger ASPs driven by strength in our commercial and gaming products in the quarter.\nDCI revenue was $3.8 billion ahead of our internal forecast. Despite continued unit TAM softness, the Xeon business was up sequentially with MNC customers showing a better than seasonal recovery in the quarter. Favorable customer mix along with strong adoption of newer products with higher core density led to record Xeon ASPs in Q3. Despite sequential revenue decline, DCAI returned to profitability and contributed operating profit of $71 million, improving sequentially on better ASPs, reduced factory under load charges, and continued spending discipline.\nWithin DCAI, revenue for the Programmable Solutions Group declined mid-teens percent sequentially. As we discussed earlier this month, after a period of strong growth and tight supply, the FPGA business is entering a period of inventory burn. We expect PSG to decline in Q4 and be depressed for the next few quarters as customers work through inventory before returning to a more normalized run rate and growth. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% sequentially. Edge markets showed signs of recovery in Q3, leading NEX revenue to exceed our expectations.\nNetwork and telco markets continue to work through elevated inventory and weak demand, which we expect to persist through the end of the year. NEX also returned to profitability in Q3 with operating profit of $17 million, up $200 million sequentially on stronger revenue and reduced operating expenses. Intel Foundry Services revenue was $311 million, growing 4x year-over-year and 34% sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS tools. IFS operating loss was $86 million as ramping factory and operating expenses offset stronger revenue in the period.\nMobileye continues to perform well. Q3 revenue was $530 million, up 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, with operating profit of $170 million on a consolidated basis, up 32% sequentially. This morning, Mobileye increased their fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 7% at the midpoint. Q3 represented another outstanding quarter of cross-company spending discipline and focused portfolio management, with operating expenses down 15% year-over-year.\nWhile we're on track to achieve $3 billion of total spending reductions in 2023, we expect sequentially higher OpEx in Q4 due to seasonal marketing activities, higher profit-dependent compensation, and the end of some temporary austerity measures taken earlier in the year. We also had a one-time credit in Q3 associated with an asset sale, which will impact the sequential comparison in Q4.\nNow turning to Q4 guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue of $14.6 billion-15.6 billion, delivering on our January commitment to grow revenue sequentially throughout 2023. In the client business, we're encouraged by the return of historical purchasing cycles as our channel checks, partner feedback, and ASPs all point to healthy inventory levels and growing demand. We expect moderate sequential growth from DCAI with Xeon strength more than offsetting a decline in PSG and continued recovery in edge markets, roughly offsetting persistent network weakness.\nAt the revenue midpoint of $15.1 billion, we expect gross margin to flow through at approximately 60% of revenue growth, resulting in Q4 gross margin of approximately 46.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.44. We continue to operate under our Smart capital framework. In Q3 we received a capital grant from the State of Ohio and our first foundry prepay.\nIn addition, we continue to work with the US CHIPS Office on their review of our four US applications, and we continue to work with Germany, Poland, and the European Commission on our planned expansions in Europe. There are no changes to our prior forecast of mid-30s percent net capital intensity across 2023 and 2024. In aggregate, capital offsets will trend towards the higher end of our 20-30% range in that time frame, though we do expect the vast majority of those offsets to land in 2024.\nIn closing, Q3 was Intel's strongest quarter since we began our transformation. We achieved significant milestones toward regaining process leadership on Intel 18A, delivered Meteor Lake and Emerald Rapids on time, secured multiple wafer and advanced packaging foundry customers, and delivered another quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\nWe will continue to make significant investments as we execute the IDM 2.0 strategy and we remain confident and committed to our long-term financial targets. We're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM. Our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market, we're steadily closing structural cost gaps and we continue to make progress toward delivering the financial returns that we and our owners expect. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder and as is our normal practice, we would request that each of you ask one question with a brief follow-up question to be able to get to as many of your questions as possible. With that, Jonathan, can we go to our first caller?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I just wanted to see if you can clear up some of the confusion on gross margin that came out of the innovation event. You're now coming out of the year at 46.5%, but you did roughly 43% for the year. I think at that event you said next year is going to be up, but probably not a couple hundred basis points. Did you mean off of the Q4 run rate or do you mean off of the 43% for the year? Can you shape that for us throughout the year? Thanks.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. If you don't mind, let me step back. I want to talk a little bit about Q3 for a second because Q3, I was really proud of the team's performance in terms of gross margins for Q3 coming in just shy of 46%. It was great execution in terms of spending from the team. They also did work on the underloading, which helped, and we were able to sell through some previously reserved inventory, and so that really helped propel the gross margin. We had phenomenal fall through in the third quarter.\nI'd say fourth quarter, we start to go back to what would be more of our typical fall through range. Somewhat muted by the fact that we are still going through five nodes in four years. There is spend associated with that, which mutes it. We're probably a little bit higher normally in terms of fall through, but with that it's probably like a 60% fall through. That's the normal range we think of, and that's what we're guiding for the fourth quarter. Beyond that, we'll save the rest of the commentary for next year when we close out 2023.\nI would just say just on a longer term basis, Pat has talked a lot about gross margins of 60%, and I feel like we are even more confident around our ability to hit that 60% threshold for a number of reasons. One, the execution that Pat talked about on five nodes in four years, when we get through that. Of course we eliminate the headwind on margins, but it turns around to a tailwind because when you're a process leader, you get better gross margins. Also, as product execution improves, that also, as we launch the products that are competitive in the marketplace, and we've seen that already in the client space, that helps on the gross margin side.\nMore importantly, maybe the thing that's near and dear to my heart is this internal foundry model that we've built where we're now measuring the manufacturing and TD organization as a separate P&L. We'll officially do that next year, and we'll segment report it that way. We're already this year starting to look at it that way in operations reviews. We're starting to do the planning for next year with that lens. We're doing a long-term plan in that lens.\nAll the things that we thought we would see in the dialogue between those, those functions we're already starting to see now. We see the product organizations already starting to optimize around test times, around steppings, around how many samples and hot lots they do in the fab. Suddenly things they didn't spend a lot of time thinking about before, they care a lot about now. We're already starting to see improvements in the P&L because of that.\nOn the same front in manufacturing, they're now really, really worried about loadings. They're worried about a P&L. They want to drive the most revenue they can in their P&L, try to drive the cost down as much as possible. I just think that we will see a lot of opportunities as we progress through 2024 and beyond that are really going to make an impact on gross margins and give us a lot of confidence around this 60%.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nI do, yeah. Pat, can you just talk about the dynamics and maybe the allocation that you're getting from your major foundry partner? They went out of their way to go at the idea that 18A is going to be comparable to what they'll have in that same time fram. Now that it's becoming a little more apparent that you are making progress, has there been any change in that relationship and the allocation that you're getting from them? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. First I'd say, you come to a different conclusion than what you might have heard from them. We feel that our five nodes in four years, the leadership position that we expect with Intel 18A, this is a remarkable set of work. As you heard me say in my formal comments, we think of 18A as a work of art. This is the finest transistor. We've invented the last 30 years of transistors. This is the best one that's ever been built. PowerVia, we feel very confident that we are on track to the leadership position that we described. As we've also said, hey, we're well underway on the things after that. And things like High NA, the next generation of EUV or advanced packaging with glass.\nAll of these are now being backed up and reinforced by the external customer commitments. Three 18A customers. Now you're making commitments. The prepay customer I spoke about earlier, two additional customers, partners. We announced the ARM relationship in April and they're now seeing very positive results on power performance area from 18A. As we think about the relationship with TSMC, hey, this is a great company and one that we partner with, one that we are a competitor to, one that we're a customer of. We collaborate with them.\nAs you saw, they became an investor in the IMS business this quarter as well. As a customer of those, we're very happy with how they're supporting us in our products as we're racing many of these products forward. They're a critical supplier to us as we're a critical supplier to them. This is one of the most critical relationships in the industry. I spend a lot of time personally on it. We're very confident in our roadmap, and this is really an exceptional quarter for five nodes in four years. Getting back to process leadership, we are well on our way to doing exactly what we said we would.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys, thanks for asking. Question, Pat. I wanted to follow up on one of the topics you just mentioned about your partnership with ARM. The flip side of that is there's been reports recently of a number of people entering the CPU business for PCs using ARM architectures similar to what we've seen over the last couple years on the data center side of things. Can you just talk about the competitive landscape of x86 versus ARM, and potentially, more importantly, if in fact ARM was gaining traction, would you consider using that architecture and broaden your technology internally?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, Ross. Overall, I think what you're seeing is the industry's excited around the AI PC. As I declared this generation of AI PC at our Innovation conference a couple of months ago, we're seeing that materialize and customers, competitors seeing excitement around that. ARM and Windows client alternatives generally, they've been relegated to pretty insignificant roles in the PC business and we take all competition seriously. I think history is our guide here. We don't see these as potentially being all that significant overall.\nOur momentum is strong. We have a strong roadmap. Meteor Lake launching this AI PC generation 14 December. Arrow Lake, Lunar Lake, we're already demonstrated the next generation product at Lunar Lake, which has significant improvements in performance and capabilities. We'll be sending Panther Lake, the next generation, into Fab in Q1 and Intel 18A. We announced our AI acceleration program which already has over 100 ISVs part of it. We expect in the next two years over 100 million x86 AI enhanced PCs in the marketplace.\nThis is just an extraordinary amount of volume. The ecosystem benefits that that brings into the marketplace. Thinking about other alternative architectures like ARM, we also say, wow, what a great opportunity for our foundry business. Given the results I referenced before, we see that as a unique opportunity that we have to participate in the full success of the ARM ecosystem, whatever market segments that may be, as an accelerant to our foundry offerings, which are now becoming, we think, very significant around the ARM ecosystem with our foundry packaging and 18A wafer capabilities as well as.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, I do. One for Dave. The OpEx side of things, you guys did great in the third quarter. You talked about it going up in the fourth quarter, but I still think the full year is ahead of what you originally had targeted. How do we think about next year's OpEx? Just conceptually, I know you said you're going to have $3 billion in total cost savings this year, $8 billion-10 billion. Longer term, what are the puts and takes on OpEx as we look into 2024?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Again, back to the pride thing. I'm really proud of what we did in the third quarter and really what we've been able to execute for the year on that spend, on that spend reduction. There was a lot of work associated with that. We had to drive a lot of obviously efficiency. More importantly, as Pat talked about, we took 10 programs or product areas and either divested them of them or closed them out in an effort to improve our spending. In addition to that, I would say that we also looked at businesses where we thought we could dramatically unlock value. We think we've done the three areas that we thought most likely unlock value.\nI think from that perspective, we feel we're pretty done with the activities associated with spending. That said, we do think we'll see benefit from our internal foundry model not only on the cost side, but also on the OpEx side. That's the area that we'll focus over the long term in terms of managing spending. Ultimately the goal is to get the 60% gross margins, but it's also to get to 40% operating margins. That does entail driving efficiency in OpEx, and we think there's plenty of opportunity. I'd say the same thing on OpEx that I said on gross margins. We'll save the fourth quarter or the 2024 visibility for 2024 when we close out 2023.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nPerfect. Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. I think you talked about the Gaudi pipeline doubling in the last 90 days. I guess you're nearing $2 billion of visibility there. Can you talk to that a little bit how much of that is training versus inference?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you. Yeah, thank you. Overall, I just say there's a lot of surge of interest in this category, Joe. In the Gaudi business for us, we're coming from a small base, but it's expanding rapidly. We do see a mix of training opportunities and inferencing opportunities when we go to the inferencing side of the workload, which we think will be the significant expansion of workload going forward. A few people generate models, a lot of people use them. How many people do weather modeling? Not many. How many people use weather models? A lot. That's how we think about training and inferencing. The power of the market will be in the inferencing deployments.\nThat will be both a Gaudi play as well as a Xeon play. I would point to the example that we spoke about, for instance with Dell, where they really see bringing together both of those to give us a full portfolio of adding inferencing to existing workloads where our AI enhanced Xeons will be strong as well as creating farms for inference, inference, or for training, where Gaudi will be more of a play. The interest that we've seen in Gaudi is a worldwide statement. We have demand portfolio that really matches the Intel balance across all geographies.\nWe're also seeing a huge upsurge in the amount of DevCloud where this provides the fast on ramp to the Intel AI and all of our advanced silicon offerings. I'd also say Joe, that this is an AI everywhere play, as I said in my formal comments, which is also Edge and client as well. We view it as Edge, client, on-premise data center, as well as a cloud, and this AI continuum is a unique position for Intel that we think gives us a very large opportunity to see this upside of capabilities that the AI workload is going to drive across all elements of computing.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a follow up?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I do, thank you. In terms of that Gaudi business, do you anticipate any impact from the China export controls and more broadly, are there any other impacts from the China export controls on Intel's business?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks Joe. I do think there's a lot of interest in that. The export controls as you look at them and read them, they're very much aimed at the high end training and these accelerator, the high end accelerators and where they're aimed. Now obviously some of that was for us as well in China. We also, as I said in the first part of your question, we saw a worldwide demand for our activities there and overall, we're now supply constrained on Gaudi and racing to catch up to that supply worldwide. Of course we're studying those, the new BIS-released rules carefully. We're working with BIS, we're in the 60-day comment period with BIS, so we're actively working with them.\nWe do believe that we'll have plenty of opportunity in China, continuing to deploy our products there broadly, even as we comply and work with BIS specifically around the regulations that they're putting in place, particularly around high-end accelerators and AI training. Overall, we feel and have included that as part of our overall guidance for the fourth quarter. We feel good about the momentum that we have for AI everywhere, and we'll of course be engaging with our customers, the governments, and as we build out our roadmap, taking all of that into consideration.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your question please.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks a lot guys. Congrats on the quarter. Pat, I was wondering if you could unpack your foundry comments. You have the customer that we've known about where there's prepays. I think you mentioned there's two more customers that you're signing up, and another by year-end, and then there's an event in the first quarter. I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more detail and talk about how that's going to flow through and the materiality into the coming years as well. Thanks a lot.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks Ben. Happy to unpack that a little bit more. We announced back at the Deutsche Bank conference that we had our first major prepay customer for that. That effort has continued to go very well since that point in time, and the relationship is expanding with that customer. We also added two more customers this quarter as well. Now we have three committed external customers on Intel 18A at the beginning of the year. I promised you one. Here we are in the third quarter, we have three, and I hope to finish at least the fourth before the end of the year.\nAlso, with 18A, this PDK milestone, and if you're inside of the industry, hitting PDK 0.9 is a really critical milestone. As I said in my formal comments, this is when the invention phase is done. Now we're into the productization phase. Ramping yields, refining performance, and getting the process capabilities ready for manufacturing. A critical milestone, which we also say now as we release that to external customers, now a lot of them can start looking at 18A and we start fanning out the engagements that we have in the industry. A critical milestone on 18A.\nThe other thing that we saw this quarter, which was a little bit unexpected, was this huge surge in interest for AI customers and Intel's advanced packaging technology. This is the one that probably we didn't even quite realize. We always knew that Intel's packaging technology was the best in the industry, but the amount of interest that we've seen. We completed two additional customers. Three 18A wafer customers, two additional packaging customers.\nWe have a pipeline that we're in active negotiations with six additional packaging customers as well. I think about this as the fast on-ramp to the Intel Foundry Services. A wafer customer is a multiple billion-dollar customer. A packaging customer is hundreds of millions of dollars. That billions of dollars takes two to three years to materialize. The wafer customers takes two to three quarters to materialize right in the packaging. This is a much faster way for us to build out that business. We're going to start to see those packaging customers start to materialize for us in revenue next year.\nYou add to that the Synopsys partnership, the ARM momentum, the Tower agreement, the flywheel of momentum has now begun for the Intel Foundry Services business. It really is putting points up across the board for that business, and super happy with the amount of energy that we're now seeing across the industry for the foundry business. This was a great quarter for foundry at Intel.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nBen, do you have a follow up?\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks John. Going to switch gears to PCs, your comments there. You've talked about inventories, normalizing. I just wanted to hear a little bit more detail on your confidence in that. Do you have confidence that the inventory builds are matching demand, and how do you see that playing out next year? It sounds like you think the TAM will grow back to 300, so just wanted some comments on that. Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, three quarters in a row we've seen the client business being very healthy now for us. Our customers' inventory levels are very healthy in that regard. We see our sell-in being matched by a sellout for those customers. As we said, the 270 million consumption TAM is something we indicated earlier in the year, and now we're seeing that play out exactly. Here we are three weeks into the quarter, and I'd say it's looking really good. Our views and forecasts of our client business is very healthy for Q4.\nWe do think this idea of ushering in the AI PC generation will be a multi-year cycle. We do think this will bring excitement into the category, even starting with the Meteor Lake or the Core Ultra launch in Q4. We also have some other incremental tailwinds with Copilot launch from Microsoft coming up this quarter. We also have the Windows 10 end of service support coming up. Those are just incremental tailwinds that just build us more confidence in it.\nFinally, our roadmap is great. Meteor Lake looking good. Rapidly ramping what we have coming with Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake and then Panther Lake in the future. Every aspect of this business is demonstrating health, maturity, momentum, and great opportunity for tomorrow.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI just add one other thing. We track the linearity of shipments. Linearity was really, really good in the third quarter, and it's off to a really good start for the fourth quarter. Generally when you see really steady shipment across the entire quarter, that's a good sign that you balanced out the inventory and you're really just shipping in what's shipping out.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nPerfect. Thank you. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO . Your question, please.\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHi, thank you very much. This is either for Pat or for Dave. I just wanted to come back to the DCAI. In the PowerPoint, you mentioned competitive pressure. I think, Dave, if I heard you correct, you said ASPs were record. Could you just explain what you meant by competitive pressure? I would have thought that would have led to ASPs being lower, or was the impact on the unit size?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. There's a couple things to unpack there. Our views of the quarter, we would have expected that we lost some market share. That was based on competitive losses from last year. Even those are just rolling through our customers. That said, we did a bit better than we thought we would in the quarter. We are ramping Sapphire Rapids, which has a higher ASP, more rapidly than we would have expected. Also as we go to the higher core count versions, that drives up the per socket ASP more aggressively. Overall, we definitely feel those competitive pressures.\nAs I say, we're working on issues that began years ago, but we're also combining that with Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids, Gen5, the roadmap for Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, which have much higher core counts, which will drive higher ASPs as well. All of that put together, we do feel like we're on a very solid trajectory for the business overall. We will see ASPs continue to rise. The roadmap's very healthy as we go forward, and I feel like the market and our customers are starting to feel that competitiveness come back to our business here and looking forward to the benefits that a stronger Intel roadmap will offer to them and their businesses.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nAmbrish, do you have a follow-up question?",
    "content2": "Ambrish Srivastava\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nI did, thank you, John. I have a follow-up. Intel's showing pretty steady execution, and I can't say that in the last several years we haven't seen that. Coming back to the long-term model that Dave, you were talking about, can you just help us understand what are the parameters around that revenue mix of the business? You would have an IFS which would be dilutive to gross margin, potentially not to operating margin. What's the right way to think about that 60/40 in terms of the business mix and even size of the business?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I think the first thing to improve the gross margins is going to be around getting ourselves finally to process leadership and getting the products completely, as Pat was talking about the product roadmap improving significantly, getting to where we have definitive leadership across all products. I think those two things will drive a significant lift on the gross margins, irrespective of anything else we have on the business front.\nWhen I look at, as I talked about this internal foundry model, I just think there's so much low-hanging fruit on the cost side, both in the business units and also in the manufacturing and TD, our internal foundry business, that there's significant improvement that we can make on gross margins. Yeah, mix does have an impact on the business and we have a wide range of products that will have different margins, but almost all of them are punching below their weight right now. As we improve all of them, that should lift the gross margins meaningfully over time.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Ambrish. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking a question. Also congrats on the execution in the quarter. Going back to the prior question, just thinking about the trajectory of the ASP expansion in the data center segment. How do I look at that and think about what the normalizing operating profit might look like in DCAI as you guys look out over time? I know that you turned profitable this quarter. I'm just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about the path of profitability in that segment.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, maybe I'll start. Pat, feel free to chime in. Obviously it was, I think, pretty important for us to show profitability this quarter. That was one of Pat and I's goals written on a sheet of paper that we wanted to see this business return to profitability. That said, it's making a lot of investments right now to improve the product portfolio on the CPU side and make the investments necessary on the AI front.\nThis business longer term should have margins that are very similar to margins you see from its peers when they are operating at healthy levels of margins. We have a lot of work to do to get there, but I think the path is pretty clear. Of course ASP will be a component of that, but there's a lot of efficiencies they can drive beyond just ASPs that will improve the margins longer term.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nAs Dave and I think about the 60/40 model that we're driving to long term, we think about the data center business being above that for it, where some of the more volume oriented businesses like client might be a little bit below that. Taken together, that's how we're driving the business. Overall, as we said, we see a lot of margin expansion potential across data center, client, networking, and foundry as we get back to process leadership and build that business up.\nI'd also emphasize that as we build our foundry capacity, we build more capacity in our factory network for internal and external customers. That's a tide that lifts all boats for us because it improves the profitability, not just the foundry, but the competitiveness and the profitability of our product businesses as well. Overall we feel like this was a really important milestone for us this quarter, seeing not just great financial results, but the operational results were even better than that, which is what led me to say, hey, this was an outstanding quarter for us overall.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nAaron, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, I do. Thanks, John, and thanks for the detail there. As a quick follow-up. Just thinking about the gross margin line, I'm curious, Dave. I know last quarter I think it was, I want to say it's $220 million or so factory under load impact in gross margin. It sounds like you had a reversal of inventory reserve and gross margin this quarter. Are we done with the factory underload, or what was that number, and how are you thinking about that embedded in a gross margin guide?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, it was a meaningful benefit, the underload improvement in the quarter. That said, there was still a reasonable amount of underload charges in the quarter. That does improve a bit in the fourth quarter. We'll be dealing with this underload hangover, I call it, probably all through next year. As we progress, but largely in part because while we will improve the loadings and probably get beyond underload charges on a quarterly basis, we'll still have all of that underload tied up in the cost of the wafers, in inventory, and that still has to get flushed through before we're completely done\nMeaningful improvement. I'd say we're largely out of the woods, but still some wood to chop through next year to where we're completely clean of under load.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Aaron Jonathan, I think we have time for one last caller.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our final question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Before I started, I just wanted to say a bit, Pat, Dave, and all the Intel folks, we're thinking about all your folks in Israel. Maybe you'll take these questions that I need to ask with due reverence to that. Unlike a lot of your competitors and peers, you guys actually have operations and fabs in Israel. Maybe you could give us a little bit of an update there on how things are going operationally, jsoust given the atrocities that have gone on, what the size of the wafer outputs of those fabs are, what nodes they're on, any kind of details there would be really helpful. Thanks guys.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, yeah. As one of the earliest companies in Israel, now almost 50 years that were in country, I appreciate deeply. These are the Intel team, this is people that I consider friends, personally as well. That said, the resilience of the Intel team is remarkable. Despite all of these challenges, we'll say they're not missing a single commitment, they're performing extremely well. We continue to deliver the products that they're working on and continuing to drive the factory operations and our factory expansions that we have there. That said, one of the benefits of Intel's multi-geo supply chain that we uniquely have in the industry is resilience.\nIntel 7 is running in the factory there in Israel. We also have two other locations that we run Intel 7. We're making sure that we have the resilience of our supply chain for all of those products so that we can be very assured, even as we're highly confident in the capabilities of our Intel Israel team to continue to perform despite the atrocities. We're also confident that we have a resilience in our core business model that gives us flexibility to assure supply and continued operation across the globe. Regardless of what issue you may have in Asia, Americas, Europe, and Middle East, we are well positioned to deliver that for our customers across all of our operations.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nMatt, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, I do, and thanks for that, Pat. As my follow up, one of the things that I keep getting asked about a ton is the CapEx swing that's happened towards GenAI infrastructure. I guess the way that I've been phrasing the question is the video killed the radio star question. Is this the death of CPU growth in the data center? I don't think it is, to be clear, but there's some out there that do. Pat, you made some comments in your script and then some other answers about.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nReturn to normalcy on data center CPU from a growth perspective. Maybe you could give a few data points or anecdotes that might support that. Thank you.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and I do think there's clearly been the surge of interest in Gen AI, which has over a couple of quarters driven a bias on the part of the cloud guys in particular to where do they put their floor space, where do they put their power budgets? That's been driving largely a race for the largest system environments that they can put in place. That said, training of these large models is interesting, but the deployment to those models, the inferencing use of those models is what we believe is truly spectacular for the future.\nSome of that will run on the accelerators, but a huge amount of that is going to run right on Xeons as we bring AI into those applications or AI-ification of existing applications. Given the leadership performance that we have on our Gen4 for AI applications, that gets better with Gen5. When we deliver Granite Rapids, it gets 2-3x better, as I said in the comments, it gets even better as we go further out into the roadmap. The ability for us to do inference at scale on our Xeon product line, we think is very profound as we go forward. The roadmap is very healthy. The combination of Gaudi and Xeons, that is exactly what you heard Dell announce in their roadmap.\nWe're just seeing, I'll say, the normalcy of that in the buying behavior. We saw a very good uptick for our OEMs this quarter as they're seeing their Xeon businesses. We're also seeing more ecosystem embrace our DevCloud, lots of customers coming on it for both AI use cases on Xeon and on Gaudi. Key announcements like we had from Deloitte as they're partnering with us across application optimization as well as AI development on Xeon platform.\nOverall we feel pretty comfortable that we're in a cycle, that there will be growth in CPUs led by Xeon as well as accelerators. Intel is going to be participating in both of those capacities and meaningful ways. This is part of what we said is AI everywhere, AI at the Edge, AI at the client, AI in the data center, and AI in the cloud. Inference will be the discussion topic for the industry as we go into 2024. That'll be done at scale and much of that is going to be done on Xeons.\nWith that, let's just thank you for joining us again. I want to reiterate our thoughts for our resilient Intel team in Israel and for all of those in the region that are affected by recent events. I also want to thank you for joining us on the call again today and your interest in Intel. We appreciate the opportunity to update you, answer your questions, respond to that. Most important, we're excited by the momentum we're seeing.\nAs I said, the financial results were great. The operational results were truly outstanding this quarter and it's a confirmation of our Foundry strategy, of our five nodes everywhere, of our AI everywhere strategy. We do hope that you're able to join us for our launch of Emerald Rapids Gen5 Meteor Lake Core Ultra in New York in December. I do also hope to see you all at our Q1 Intel Foundry Day. Thank you. Good afternoon, good night. Wherever in the world you be. Take care and be safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.\nThank you for standing by and welcome to Intel Corporation's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you'll need to press star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 11 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor relations website, intc.com, for those joining us online today; the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, you will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\nIt also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you John and good afternoon everyone. Before we begin, given our significant and now almost 50-year presence in Israel, we are deeply saddened by the recent attacks and their impact on the region. Our utmost priority is the safety and welfare of our people in Israel and their families. I also want to recognize the resilience of our teams as they have kept our operations running and our factory expansion progressing. Our thoughts are with all of those affected by the war and I am praying for a swift return to peace.\nTurning to our results, we delivered an outstanding Q3, beating expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was above the high end of our guidance and EPS benefited from both strong operating leverage and expense discipline. More important than our standout financial performance were the key operational milestones we achieved in the quarter across process and products, Intel Foundry Services, and our strategy to bring AI everywhere. Simply put, this quarter demonstrates the meaningful progress we have made towards our IDM 2.0 transformation.\nThe foundation of our strategy is reestablishing transistor power and performance leadership. While many thought our ambitions were a bit audacious when we began our five nodes and four-year journey roughly two and a half years ago, we have increasing line of sight towards achieving our goal. Intel 7 is done with nearly 150 million units in aggregate of Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids already in the market. In addition, Emerald Rapids has achieved product release and began shipping this month.\nIn Q3, we began initial shipments of Meteor Lake on Intel 4, which we are now aggressively ramping on the most productive fleet of EUV tools in the industry, providing us with a greater than 20% capital efficiency advantage compared to when EUV tools were first launched. High-volume EUV manufacturing is well underway in Oregon and more recently in Ireland. Our Fab 34 in Ireland represents th\ne first high-volume EUV production in Europe, underscoring our commitment to establish geographically diverse and resilient supply. We are the only leading-edge semiconductor manufacturer at scale in every major region of the globe. Our Intel 3 process is tracking to be manufacturing-ready by year-end, supporting our first two Intel 3 products, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. In fact, our production stepping of Sierra Forest is already out of fab and what we expect to be the production stepping of Granite Rapids has already taped in and is in the fab now.\nWe are particularly excited by our move into the angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. Adding to our accelerating adoption of EUV are two key new innovations, RibbonFET and PowerVia, representing the first fundamental change to the transistor and process architecture since we commercialized FinFET in 2012. I have been studying SEM diagrams for almost 40 years. RibbonFET and PowerVia are true works of art, the most exquisite transistors ever created. We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness on Intel 20A in H1 2024. Arrow Lake, our lead product on 20A, is already running Windows and demonstrating excellent functionality.\nEven more significant, we hit a critical milestone on Intel 18A with the 0.9 release of the PDK with imminent availability to external customers. In simple terms, the invention phase of RibbonFET and PowerVia is now complete and we are racing towards production-ready industry-leading process technology. Our first products on Intel 18A will go into Fab on schedule in Q1 2024 with Clearwater Forest for servers, Panther Lake for clients, and of course a growing number of IFS test chips. We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness for Intel 18A in H2 2024, completing our incredible five nodes in four years journey on or ahead of schedule.\nWhile Intel 18A reestablishes transistor leadership, we are racing to increase that lead. We announced at Innovation our plans to lead the industry in a move to glass substrate for high density performance and unique optical capabilities. We also announced our plans to begin installation of the world's first High NA EUV tool for commercial use by the end of the year, to continue our modernizations and infrastructure expansions of our Gordon Moore Park in Oregon, home of our technology development team.\nMoore's Law continues to be the foundational driver of semiconductor technology and economics, which in turn fuels broader innovation in every industry across the globe. We remain committed to be good stewards of Moore's Law and drive advancements until we have exhausted every element on the periodic table. Importantly, our progress on process technology is now being well validated by third parties.\nWe have made great progress with early IFS customers this quarter, which we expect to only accelerate with the release of the 0.9 PDK for Intel 18A, a major customer committed to Intel 18A and Intel 3, which includes a meaningful prepayment that expedites and expands our capacity corridor for this customer. The customer is seeing particularly good power, performance, and area efficiency in their design. This opportunity is very significant and highlights our full systems foundry capabilities in high performance computing, big die designs, leadership performance, and area efficient transistors, advanced packaging, and systems expertise.\nIn addition, we are extremely pleased to announce today that we have signed with two additional 18A customers. Both are particularly focused in areas of high performance compute and benefiting from power performance per unit silicon area. We have also made substantial progress with our next major customer and are expecting to conclude commercial contract negotiations before year end.\nFinally, we were also very happy to expand our growing foundry ecosystem by completing our strategic partnership with Synopsys in Q3 to include IP for Intel 3 and Intel 18A for both Intel internal and external foundry customers. With the rise of AI and high performance computing applications, our advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another unique advantage. We have seen a surge of interest in our advanced packaging from most leading AI chip companies, with capacity corridors quickly available. This is proving to be a significant accelerant and on ramp for Intel Foundry customers.\nDuring the quarter, we were awarded two customer AI designs for our advanced packaging, and with an additional six customers in active negotiations, we expect several more awards by year end. We have also established an important business relationship with Tower Semiconductor utilizing our manufacturing assets in New Mexico along with Tower investing capital expenditures of roughly $300 million for its use in this facility. This represents an important step in our Foundry strategy, improving cash flows by utilizing our manufacturing assets over a significantly longer period of time.\nFinally, we have submitted all four of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon representing over $100 billion of US manufacturing and research investments to the CHIPS Program Office, and are working closely with them as they review these proposals. We look forward to providing a deeper update on our foundry business during our planned IFS industry event in Q1 of 2024.\nWe are on a mission to bring AI everywhere. We see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. We are empowering the market to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI and automation all their applications. For the developer working with multi-trillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance competitive MLPerf benchmarks and a very cost efficient TCO.\nHowever, as the world moves toward more AI-integrated application, there's a market shift towards local inferencing. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inference cost. With AI-accelerated Xeon for Enterprise Core Ultra launching the AI PC generation and OpenVINO enabling developers seamless and versatile support for a range of client and edge silicon. We are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than forcing it into the cloud.\nOur expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. The AI continuum enables AI everywhere. DCAI exceeded our forecast this quarter with server revenue up modestly sequentially. We continue to see a strong ramp of our 4th-gen Xeon processor. With the world's top 10 CSPs now in general availability and improving strength from MNCs.\nDuring the quarter we shipped our 1 millionth 4th-gen Xeon unit and are on track to surpass 2 million units next month. 4th-gen Xeon includes powerful accelerators demonstrating best-in-class CPU performance for AI, security, and networking workloads. Our AI-enhanced Xeons are primed for model inferencing, enabling seamless infusion of AI into existing workloads. This was visible this quarter with over 1/3 of fourth gen Xeon shipments directly related to AI applications.\nWe are the clear leader in AI CPU results as seen in MLCommons benchmarks today, and our roadmap provides significant further improvements with Granite Rapids expected to deliver an additional 2-3x AI performance on top of our industry-leading fourth gen Xeon. We continue to make excellent progress with our Xeon roadmap. Our 5th Gen Xeon processor codenamed Emerald Rapids is in production and ramping to customers, and will officially launch on 14 December in New York City.\nSierra Forest, our first E-core Xeon, is on track for H1 2024 with customers well into their validation process. Sierra Forest will feature up to 288 E-cores targeting next-generation cloud-native workloads, delivering even more price-performance and power efficiency for our customers. Granite Rapids, which shortly follows Sierra Forest, is also well into our validation cycle with customers.\nWhile the industry has seen some wallet share shifts between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, as well as some inventory burn in the server market, we see signs of normalization as we enter Q4, driving modest sequential TAM growth across most customers. We expect to exit the year at healthy inventory levels, and we see growth in compute cores returning to more normal historical rates off a depressed 2023. More importantly, our successful roadmap execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen4 and Gen5 Xeon, Sierra Forest, and Granite Rapids positioning us well to win back share in the data center.\nIn addition, we expect to capture a growing portion of the accelerator market in 2024 with our suite of AI accelerators led by Gaudi, which is setting leadership benchmark results with third parties like MLCommons and Hugging Face. We are pleased with the customer momentum we are seeing from our accelerator portfolio and Gaudi in particular, and we have nearly doubled our pipeline over the last 90 days.\nAs we look to 2024 like many others, we now are focused on having enough supply to meet our growing demand. Dell is partnering with us to deliver Gaudi for cloud and enterprise customers with its next generation PowerEdge systems featuring Xeon and Gaudi AI accelerators to support AI workloads ranging from large scale training to inferencing at the edge.\nTogether with Stability AI, we are building one of the world's largest AI supercomputers entirely on fourth gen Xeon processors and 4,000 Intel Gaudi 2 AI accelerators. Our Gaudi roadmap remains on track with Gaudi 3 out of the Fab now in packaging and expected to launch next year, and in 2025 Falcon Shores brings our GPU and Gaudi capabilities into a single product.\nMoving to the client, CCG delivered another strong quarter, exceeding expectations for the third consecutive quarter, driven by strength in commercial and consumer gaming SKUs, where we are delivering leadership performance. As we expected, customers completed their inventory burn in the first half of the year, driving solid sequential growth, which we expect will continue into Q4. We expect full year 2023 PC consumption to be in line with our Q1 expectations of approximately 270 million units.\nIn the near term, we expect Windows 10 end of service to be a tailwind, and we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PC TAM returning to ±300 million units. Intel continues to be a pioneer in the industry as we ushered in the era of the AI PC in Q3 when we released the Intel Core Ultra processor codenamed Meteor Lake. Built on Intel 4.\nThe Intel Core Ultra has been shipping to customers for several weeks and will officially launch on 14 December alongside our 5th-gen Xeon. The Ultra represents the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance. It is also the first Intel client processor to feature our Integrated Neural Processing Unit or NPU that enables dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads.\nNext year we will deliver Arrow Lake as well as Lunar Lake which offers our next-gen NPU, Ultra low-power mobility, and breakthrough performance per watt. Panther Lake, our 2025 client offering, heads into the fab in Q1 2024 on Intel 18A. The arrival of the AI PC represents an inflection point in the PC industry not seen since we first introduced Centrino in 2003.\nCentrino was so successful because of our time to market advantage, our embrace of an open ecosystem, strong OEM partnerships, our performance silicon, and our developer scale. Not only are these same advantages in place today, they are even stronger as we enter the age of the AI PC. We are catalyzing this moment with our AI PC Acceleration Program.\nWith over 100 ISVs already participating, providing access to Intel's deep bench of engineering talent for targeted software optimization, core development tools, and go to market opportunities, we are encouraged and motivated by our partners and competitors who see the tremendous growth potential of the PC market. NEX is also seeing early signs of the benefits from growing AI use cases. Our Ethernet and IPU businesses are well suited to support the high I/O bandwidth required by AI workloads in the data center, with growth expected to accelerate for both in 2024.\nAdditionally, at the Edge, as part of Intel's focus on every aspect of the AI Continuum, NEX launched OpenVINO 2023.1, the latest version of the AI inference and deployment runtime of choice for developers on client and Edge platforms, with AI, IO, and Fit:match demonstrating how they use OpenVINO to accelerate their applications. At our Innovation conference, we have leading developer software toolchains that have seen a doubling of developer engagements this year. While NEX entered their inventory correction after client and DCAI Q3 results beat our internal forecast and grew sequentially, we see continued signs of stabilization heading into Q4.\nFinally, our smart capital strategy underpins our relentless drive for efficiency and our commitment to be great allocators of our owners' capital while consistently looking for innovative ways to unlock value for all our stakeholders. We remain on track to reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023, and we continue to see significant incremental opportunities for operational improvement as we execute on our internal foundry model.\nIn addition, in Q3 we made the decision to divest the pluggable module portion of our silicon photonics business, allowing us to focus on the higher value component business and optical I/O solutions to enable AI infrastructure scaling. This marks the tenth business we have exited in the last two and a half years, generating $1.8 billion in annual savings, and a testament to our efforts to optimize our portfolio and drive long-term value creation.\nMobileye's solid Q3 and Q4 outlook continue to underscore the benefits of increased autonomy afforded by our initial public offering last year. In addition, we added TSMC as a minority investor in our IMS Nanofabrication business in Q3, and earlier this month, we announced our plans to operate PSG as a standalone business beginning 1 January. Similar to Mobileye and IMS, this decision gives PSG the mandate, focus, and resources to better capitalize on their growth opportunities. We plan to report PSG results as a standalone segment in Q1, to bring in private investors in 2024, and to create a path to an initial public offering over the next two to three years.\nIn summary, we continue to deliver tangible progress two and a half years into our transformation journey. We are on track with five nodes in four years, we are hitting or beating all our product roadmap milestones, we are establishing ourselves as a global at scale systems foundry for both wafer processing and advanced packaging. We are unlocking new growth opportunities fueled by AI, and we are driving financial discipline and operational efficiencies as we continue to unlock value for our shareholders.\nWhile we are encouraged by our progress to date, we know we have much more work in front of us as we continue to relentlessly drive forward with our strategy, maintain our execution momentum, and deliver our commitments to our customers. I like to personally thank the Intel family for all their efforts. With that, let me turn it over to Dave to go through our results in more detail and provide guidance for Q4.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter financially on top of outstanding execution on our product and process roadmaps as we continue to drive our IDM 2.0 transformation. We beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin, and EPS while we continue to monitor economic indicators and geopolitical risks. We're pleased with the momentum and health of our business and we'll continue to focus on prioritizing our investments prudently and aggressively, managing near-term expenses and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term.\nQ3 revenue was $14.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and $750 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations across all major lines of business. Gross margin was 45.8%, 280 basis points better than our guidance, driven by higher revenue and ASPs, and better sell-through of previously reserved inventory. EPS for the quarter was $0.41, beating guidance by $0.21 as our revenue strength. Improving gross margins and disciplined OpEx management resulted in sequential EPS growth of $0.28. Q3 operating cash flow was $5.8 billion, up $3 billion sequentially.\nNet inventory was down $500 million or seven days in the quarter. We also significantly improved the linearity of our shipments, which brought DSO down by five days in total. Our working capital improvement initiatives have yielded more than $2 billion of cash year to date. Net CapEx was $4.9 billion, resulting in positive adjusted free cash flow of approximately $950 million, and we paid dividends of half a billion dollars in the quarter.\nIn Q3, we announced the sale of 10% of our IMS Nanofabrication business to TSMC following the investment from Bain Capital in June. When combined with the Mobileye IPO, these transactions have unlocked more than $30 billion of value. Earlier this month we signaled our intent to pursue private investment and ultimately an IPO for our PSG business as we continue to pursue opportunities to increase value for our shareholders.\nMoving to Q3 business unit results, CCG delivered revenue of $7.9 billion, up 16% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Customer inventory levels are healthy and the market remains on track to our January consumption TAM signal of roughly 270 million units for 2023. CCG's operating profit doubled sequentially to $2.1 billion on higher revenue sell through of reserved inventory and stronger ASPs driven by strength in our commercial and gaming products in the quarter.\nDCI revenue was $3.8 billion ahead of our internal forecast. Despite continued unit TAM softness, the Xeon business was up sequentially with MNC customers showing a better than seasonal recovery in the quarter. Favorable customer mix along with strong adoption of newer products with higher core density led to record Xeon ASPs in Q3. Despite sequential revenue decline, DCAI returned to profitability and contributed operating profit of $71 million, improving sequentially on better ASPs, reduced factory under load charges, and continued spending discipline within DCAI.\nRevenue for the Programmable Solutions Group declined mid-teens percent sequentially. As we discussed earlier this month. After a period of strong growth and tight supply, the FPGA business is entering a period of inventory burn. We expect PSG to decline in Q4 and be depressed for the next few quarters as customers work through inventory before returning to a more normalized run rate and growth.\nNEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% sequentially. Edge markets showed signs of recovery in Q3, leading NEX revenue to exceed our expectations. Network and telco markets continue to work through elevated inventory and weak demand, which we expect to persist through the end of the year. NEX also returned to profitability in Q3 with operating profit of $17 million, up $200 million sequentially on stronger revenue, and reduced operating expenses.\nIntel Foundry Services revenue was $311 million, growing 4x year-over-year and 34% sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS tools. IFS operating loss was $86 million as ramping factory and operating expenses offset stronger revenue in the period. Mobileye continues to perform well. Q3 revenue was $530 million, up 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, with operating profit of $170 million on a consolidated basis, up 32% sequentially. This morning, Mobileye increased their fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 7% at the midpoint.\nQ3 represented another outstanding quarter of cross-company spending discipline and focused portfolio management, with operating expenses down 15% year-over-year. While we're on track to achieve $3 billion of total spending reductions in 2023, we expect sequentially higher OpEx in Q4 due to seasonal marketing activities, higher profit-dependent compensation, and the end of some temporary austerity measures taken earlier in the year. We also had a one-time credit in Q3 associated with an asset sale, which will impact the sequential comparison in Q4.\nNow turning to Q4 guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue of $14.6 billion-15.6 billion, delivering on our January commitment to grow revenue sequentially throughout 2023. In the client business, we're encouraged by the return of historical purchasing cycles as our channel checks, partner feedback, and ASPs all point to healthy inventory levels and growing demand. We expect moderate sequential growth from DCAI with Xeon strength more than offsetting a decline in PSG and continued recovery in edge markets roughly offsetting persistent network weakness.\nAt the revenue midpoint of $15.1 billion, we expect gross margin to flow through at approximately 60% of revenue growth, resulting in Q4 gross margin of approximately 46.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.44. We continue to operate under our Smart capital framework. In Q3, we received a capital grant from the State of Ohio and our first foundry prepay.\nIn addition, we continue to work with the US CHIPS Office on their review of our four US applications, and we continue to work with Germany, Poland, and the European Commission on our planned expansions in Europe. There are no changes to our prior forecast of mid-30s percent net capital intensity across 2023 and 2024. In aggregate, capital offsets will trend towards the higher end of our 20 to 30% range in that time frame, though we do expect the vast majority of those offsets to land in 2024.\nIn closing, Q3 was Intel's strongest quarter since we began our transformation. We achieved significant milestones toward regaining process leadership on Intel 18A, delivered Meteor Lake and Emerald Rapids on time, secured multiple wafer and advanced packaging foundry customers, and delivered another quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\nWe will continue to make significant investments as we execute the IDM 2.0 strategy, and we remain confident and committed to our long-term financial targets. We're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM. Our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market, we're steadily closing structural cost gaps, and we continue to make progress toward delivering the financial returns that we and our owners expect. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder and as is our normal practice, we would request that each of you ask one question with a brief follow-up question to be able to get to as many of your questions as possible. With that, Jonathan, can we go to our first caller?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I just wanted to see if you can clear up some of the confusion on gross margin that came out of the innovation event. You're now coming out of the year at 46.5%, but you did roughly 43% for the year. I think at that event you said next year is going to be up, but probably not a couple hundred basis points. Did you mean off of the Q4 run rate or do you mean off of the 43% for the year? Can you shape that for us throughout the year? Thanks.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. if you don't mind, let me step back. I want to talk a little bit about Q3 for a second because Q3 I was really proud of the team's performance in terms of gross margins for Q3, coming in just shy of 46%. It was great execution in terms of spending from the team. They also did work on the underloading which helped, and we were able to sell through some previously reserved inventory, and so that really helped propel the gross margin. We had phenomenal fall through in the third quarter.\nI'd say fourth quarter, we start to go back to what would be more of our typical fall through range, somewhat muted by the fact that we are still going through five nodes in four years. There is spend associated with that, which mutes it. We're probably a little bit higher normally in terms of fall through, but with that it's probably like a 60% fall through. That's the normal range we think of, and that's what we're guiding for the fourth quarter. Beyond that, we'll save the rest of the commentary for next year when we close out 2023.\nI would just say, just on a longer-term basis, Pat has talked a lot about gross margins of 60%, and I feel like we are even more confident around our ability to hit that 60% threshold for a number of reasons. One, the execution that Pat talked about on five nodes in four years. When we get through that, of course we eliminate the headwind on margins, but it turns around to a tailwind because when you're a process leader, you get better gross margins also as product execution improves that also as we launch the products that are competitive in the marketplace. We've seen that already in the client space. That helps on the gross margin side.\nMore importantly, maybe the thing that's near and dear to my heart is this internal foundry model that we've built where we're now measuring the manufacturing and TD organization as a separate P&L. We'll officially do that next year, and we'll segment report it that way. We're already this year starting to look at it that way in operations reviews. We're starting to do the planning for next year in that with that lens. We're doing the long term plan in that lens.\nAll the things that we thought we would see in the dialogue between those functions, we're already starting to see now. We see the product organizations already starting to optimize around test times, around steppings, around how many samples and hot lots they do in the fab. Suddenly, things they didn't spend a lot of time thinking about before, they care a lot about now. We're already starting to see improvements in the P&L because of that.\nOn the same front in manufacturing, they're now really, really worried about loadings. They're worried about a P&L. They want to drive the most revenue they can in their P&L, try to drive the cost down as much as possible. I just think that we will see a lot of opportunities as we progress through 2024 and beyond that are really going to make an impact on gross margins and give us a lot of confidence around this 60%.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nI do, yeah. Pat, can you just talk about the dynamics and maybe the allocation that you're getting from your major foundry partner? They went out of their way to go at the idea that 18A is going to be comparable to what they'll have in that same time frame. Now that it's becoming a little more apparent that you are making progress, has there been any change in that relationship and the allocation that you're getting from them? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. First I'd say, you come to a different conclusion than what you might have heard from them. We feel that our five nodes in four years, the leadership position that we expect with Intel 18A, this is a remarkable set of work. As you heard me say in my formal comments, we think of 18A as a work of art. This is the finest transistor. We've invented the last 30 years of transistors. This is the best one that's ever been built. PowerVia, we feel very confident that we are on track to the leadership position that we described.\nAs we've also said, hey, we're well underway on the things after that. Things like High NA, the next generation of EUV or advanced packaging with glass. All of these are now being backed up and reinforced by the external customer commitments. Three 18A customers now, making commitments. The prepay customer I spoke about earlier, two additional customers partners. We announced the ARM relationship in April, and they're now seeing very positive results on power performance area from 18A.\nAs we think about the relationship with TSMC, hey, this is a great company and one that we partner with, one that we are a competitor to, one that we're a customer of. We collaborate with them. As you saw, they became an investor in the IMS business this quarter as well. As a customer of those, we're very happy with how they're supporting us in our products as we're racing many of these products forward.\nThey're a critical supplier to us as we're a critical supplier to them. This is one of the most critical relationships in the industry. I spend a lot of time personally on it. We're very confident in our roadmap and this is really an exceptional quarter for five nodes in four years. Getting back to process leadership, we are well on our way to doing exactly what we said we would.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for asking a question. Pat, I wanted to follow up on one of the topics you just mentioned about your partnership with ARM. The flip side of that is there's been reports recently of a number of people entering the CPU business for PCs using ARM architectures similar to what we've seen over the last couple years on the data center side of things. Can you just talk about the competitive landscape of x86 versus ARM? Ppotentially, more importantly, if in fact ARM was gaining traction, would you consider using that architecture and broaden your technology internally?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, Ross. Overall, I think what you're seeing is the industry's excited around the AI PC. As I declared this generation of AI PC at our innovation conference a couple of months ago, we're seeing that materialize and customers, competitors seeing excitement around that. ARM and Windows client alternatives generally, they've been relegated to pretty insignificant roles in the PC business. We take all competition seriously. I think history is our guide here, we don't see these as potentially being all that significant overall.\nOur momentum is strong. We have a strong roadmap. Meteor Lake launching this AI PC generation 14 December, Arrow Lake, Lunar Lake. We're already demonstrated the next generation product at Lunar Lake, which has significant improvements in performance and capabilities. We'll be sending Panther Lake, the next generation, into Fab in Q1 and Intel 18A. We announced our AI acceleration program, which already has over 100 ISVs part of it. We expect in the next two years over 100 million x86 AI-enhanced PCs in the marketplace. This is just an extraordinary amount of volume, the ecosystem benefits that that brings into the marketplace.\nThinking about other alternative architectures like ARM, we also say, wow, what a great opportunity for our foundry business. Given the results I referenced before, we see that as a unique opportunity that we have to participate in the full success of the ARM ecosystem or whatever market segments that may be as an accelerant to our foundry offerings, which are now becoming, we think, very significant around the ARM ecosystem with our foundry packaging and 18A wafer capabilities as well.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, I do. One for Dave. The OpEx side of things, you guys did great in Q3. You talked about it going up in Q4, but I still think the full year is ahead of what you originally had targeted. How do we think about next year's OpEx? Just conceptually, I know you said you're going to have $3 billion in total cost savings this year, $8 billion-10 billion longer term. What are the puts and takes on OpEx as we look into 2024?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation",
    "content3": "Yeah. Again, back to the pride thing. I'm really proud of what we did in the third quarter and really what we've been able to execute for the yearon that spend reduction. There was a lot of work associated with that. We had to drive a lot of, obviously, efficiency. More importantly, as Pat talked about, we took 10 programs or product areas and either divested of them or closed them out in an effort to improve our spending. In addition to that, I would say that we also looked at businesses where we thought we could dramatically unlock value. We think we've done the three areas that we thought most likely unlock value.\nI think from that perspective, we feel we're pretty done with the activities associated with spending. That said, we do think we'll see benefit from our internal foundry model not only on the cost side, but also on the OpEx side. That's the area that we'll focus over the long term in terms of managing spending. Ultimately the goal is to get the 60% gross margins, but it's also to get to 40% operating margins. That does entail driving efficiency and OpEx. We think there's plenty of opportunity. I'd say the same thing on OpEx that I said on gross margins. We'll save the fourth quarter or the 2024 visibility for 2024 when we close out 2023.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nPerfect. Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. I think you talked about the Gaudi pipeline doubling in the last 90 days. I guess you're nearing $2 billion of visibility there. Can you talk to that a little bit how much of that is training versus inference? Thank you.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you. Overall, I'd just say there's a lot of surge of interest in this category, Joe. In the Gaudi business for us, we're coming from a small base, but it's expanding rapidly. We do see a mix of training opportunities and inferencing opportunities when we go to the inferencing side of the workload, which we think will be the significant expansion of workload going forward.\nA few people generate models, a lot of people use them. How many people do weather modeling? Not many. How many people use weather models? A lot. That's how we think about training and inferencing. The power of the market will be in the inferencing deployments, and that will be both a Gaudi play as well as a Xeon play. I would point to the example that we spoke about, for instance with Dell, where they really see bringing together both of those to give us a full portfolio of adding inferencing to existing workloads where our AI enhanced Xeons will be strong as well as creating farms for inference, inference, inference or for training, where Gaudi will be more of a play.\nThe interest that we've seen in Gaudi is a worldwide statement. We have demand portfolio that really matches the Intel balance across all geographies. We're also seeing a huge upsurge in the amount of DevCloud where this provides the fast on ramp to the Intel AI and all of our advanced silicon offerings.\nI'd also say, Joe, that this is an AI everywhere play, as I said in my formal comments here, which is also Edge and client as well. We view it as Edge, client, on-premise data center, as well as cloud. This AI Continuum is a unique position for Intel that we think gives us a very large opportunity to see this upside of capabilities that the AI workload is going to drive across all elements of computing.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a follow-up?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I do, thank you. In terms of that Gaudi business, do you anticipate any impact from the China export controls? More broadly, are there any other impacts from the China export controls on Intel's business?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks Joe. I do think there's a lot of interest in that. The export controls, as you look at them and read them they're very much aimed at the high-end training and these accelerator, the high-end accelerator somewhere they're aimed. Now obviously some of that was for us as well in China, but we also, as I said in the first part of your question, we saw a worldwide demand for our activities there and overall, we're now supply constrained on Gaudi and racing to catch up to that supply worldwide. Of course, we're studying those, the new BIS release rules carefully. We're working with BIS. We're in the 60-day comment period with BIS, so we're actively working with them.\nWe do believe that we'll have plenty of opportunity in China continuing to deploy our products there broadly, even as we comply and work with BIS specifically around the regulations that they're putting in place, particularly around high-end accelerators and AI training. Overall, we feel and have included that as part of our overall guidance for the fourth quarter. We feel good about the momentum that we have for AI everywhere, and we'll of course be engaging with our customers, the governments, and as we build out our roadmap, taking all of that into consideration.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your question please.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks a lot, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Pat, I was wondering if you could unpack your foundry comments? You have the customer that we've known about where there's prepays. I think you mentioned there's two more customers that you're signing up and another by year end, and then there's an event in Q1. I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more detail, talk about how that's going to flow through and the materiality into the coming years as well? Thanks a lot.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks Ben. Happy to unpack that a little bit more. We announced back at the Deutsche Bank conference that we had our first major prepay customer for that. That effort has continued to go very well since that point in time, and the relationship is expanding with that customer. We also added two more customers this quarter as well. Now we have three committed external customers on Intel 18A at the beginning of the year. I promised you one. Here we are in Q3, we have three, and I hope to finish at least the fourth before the end of the year.\nAlso with 18A, this PDK milestone, and if you're inside of the industry, hitting PDK 0.9 is a really critical milestone. As I said in my formal comments, this is when the invention phase is done. Now we're into the productization phase ramping yields, refining performance, and getting the process capabilities ready for manufacturing. A critical milestone, which we also say now as we release that to external customers now a lot of them can start looking at 18A and we start fanning out the engagements that we have in the industry. A critical milestone on 18A.\nThe other thing that we saw this quarter, which was a little bit unexpected, was this huge surge in interest for AI customers and Intel's advanced packaging technology. This is the one that probably we didn't even quite realize. We always knew that Intel's packaging technology was the best in the industry, but the amount of interest that we've seen. We completed two additional customers. Three 18A wafer customers, two additional packaging customers. We have a pipeline that we're in active negotiations with six additional packaging customers as well.\nI think about this as the fast on-ramp to the Intel Foundry Services. A wafer customer is a multiple billion-dollar customer. A packaging customer is hundreds of millions of dollars. That billions of dollars takes two to three years to materialize. The wafer customer takes two to three quarters to materialize right in the packaging. This is a much faster way for us to build out that business, and we're going to start to see those packaging customers start to materialize for us in revenue next year.\nYou add to that the Synopsys partnership, the ARM momentum, the Tower agreement. The flywheel of momentum has now begun for the Intel Foundry Services business. It really is putting points up across the board for that business and super happy with the amount of energy that we're now seeing across the industry for the foundry business. This was a great quarter for Foundry at Intel.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nBen, do you have a follow-up?\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks John. Gonna switch gears to PCs, your comments there.You've talked about inventories normalizing. I just wanted to hear a little bit more detail on your confidence in that. Do you have confidence that the inventory builds are matching demand, and how do you see that playing out next year? It sounds like you think the TAM will grow back to 300. Just wanted some comments on that. Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, three quarters in a row we've seen the client business being very healthy now for us. Our customers' inventory levels are very healthy in that regard. We see our sell in being matched by a sellout for those customers. As we said, the 270 million consumption TAM is something we indicated earlier in the year, and now we're seeing that play out exactly. Here we are three weeks into the quarter, and I'd say it's looking really good. Our views and forecasts of our client business is very healthy for Q4.\nWe do think this idea of ushering in the AI PC generation will be a multi-year cycle. We do think this will bring excitement into the category, even starting with the Meteor Lake or the Core Ultra launch in Q4. We also have some other incremental tailwinds with Copilot launch from Microsoft coming up this quarter. We also have the Windows 10 end of service support coming up. Those are just incremental tailwinds that just build us more confidence in it.\nFinally our roadmap is great. Meteor Lake looking good, rapidly ramping. What we have coming with Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake and then Panther Lake in the future. Every aspect of this business is demonstrating health, maturity, momentum, and great opportunity for tomorrow.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI just add one other thing. When we tracked the linearity of shipments, linearity was really, really good in Q3 and it's off to a really good start for fourth quarter. Generally when you see really steady shipment across the entire quarter, that's a good sign that you've balanced out the inventory and you're really just shipping in what's shipping out.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nPerfect. Thank you, Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question, please.\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHi, thank you very much. This is either for Pat or for Dave. I just wanted to come back to the DCAI. In the PowerPoint, you mentioned competitive pressure, but I think, Dave, if I heard you correct, you said ASPs were record. Could you just explain what you meant by competitive pressure? I would have thought that would have led to ASPs being lower or was it impact was on the unit size?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. There's a couple things to unpack there. Just our views of the quarter, we would have expected that we lost some market share. That was based on competitive losses from last year, even that are just rolling through our customers. That said, we did a bit better than we thought we would in the quarter. We are ramping Sapphire Rapids, which has a higher ASP, more rapidly than we would have expected. Also, as we go to the higher core count versions that drives up the per socket ASP more aggressively. Overall we definitely feel those competitive pressures.\nAs I say, we're working for issues that began years ago, but we're also combining that with Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids, Gen5, the roadmap for Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, which have much higher core counts, which will drive higher ASPs as well. All of that put together, we do feel like we're on a very solid trajectory for the business overall. We will see ASPs continue to rise. The roadmap's very healthy as we go forward and I feel like the market and our customers are starting to feel that competitiveness come back to our business here and looking forward to the benefits that a stronger Intel roadmap will offer to them and their businesses.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nAmbrish, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nI did, thanks, John. I have a follow-up. Intel's showing pretty steady execution, and I can't say that in the last several years we haven't seen that Just coming back to the long-term model that Dave, you were talking about, can you just help us understand what are the parameters around that revenue, mix of the business? You will have an IFS which would be dilutive to gross margin, potentially not to operating margin. What's the right way to think about that 60/40 in terms of the business mix and even size of the business?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I'd say I think the first thing to improve the gross margins is going to be around getting ourselves finally to process leadership and getting the products completely, as Pat was talking about the product roadmap improving significantly, getting to where we have definitive leadership across all products. I think those two things will drive a significant lift on the gross margins irrespective of anything else we have on the business front.\nAs I talked about this internal foundry model, I just think there's so much low-hanging fruit on the cost side, both in the business units and also in the manufacturing TD, our internal foundry business, that there's significant improvement that we can make on gross margins. Yeah, that mix does have an impact on the business, and we have a wide range of products that will have different margins, but almost all of them are punching below their weight right now. As we improve all of them, that should lift the gross margins meaningfully over time.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Ambrish. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking a question and also congrats on the execution in the quarter. Going back to the prior question, just thinking about the trajectory of the ASP expansion in the data center segment. How do I look at that and think about what the normalizing operating profit might look like in DCAI as you guys look out over time. I know that you turned profitable this quarter. I'm just trying to think about understand how you guys are thinking about the path of profitability in that segment.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, maybe I'll start. Pat, feel free to chime in. Obviously it was, I think, pretty important for us to show profitability this quarter. That was one of Pat and I's goals written on a sheet of paper that we wanted to see this business return to profitability.\nThat said, it's making a lot of investments right now to improve the product portfolio on the CPU side and make the investments necessary on the AI front. This business longer term should have margins that are very similar to margins you see from its peers when they are operating at healthy levels of margins. We have a lot of work to do to get there, but I think the path is pretty clear and of course ASP will be a component of that, but there's a lot of efficiencies they can drive beyond just ASPs that will improve the margins longer term.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. As Dave and I think about the 60/40 model that we're driving to long term, we think about the data center business being above that for it, where some of the more volume oriented businesses like client might be a little bit below that. Taken together, that's how we're driving the business. Overall, as we said, we see a lot of margin expansion potential across data center, client, networking, and foundry as we get back to process leadership and build that business up.\nI'd also emphasize that, as we build our foundry capacity, we build more capacity in our factory network for internal and external customers. That's a tide that lifts all boats for us because it improves the profitability, not just the foundry, but the competitiveness and the profitability of our product businesses as well. Overall, we feel like this was a really important milestone for us this quarter, seeing not just great financial results, but the operational results were even better than that which is what led me to say, hey, this was an outstanding quarter for us overall.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nAaron, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, I do. Thanks, John, and thanks for the detail there. As a quick follow up, just thinking about the gross margin line, I'm curious, Dave. I know last quarter I think it was, I want to say $220 million or so factory under load impact in gross margin. It sounds like you had a reversal of inventory reserve and gross margin this quarter. Are we done with the factory underload? Wwhat was that number and how are you thinking about that embedded in a gross margin guide?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. It was a meaningful benefit, the underload improvement in the quarter. That said, there was still a reasonable amount of underload charges in the quarter. That does improve a bit in the fourth quarter. We'll be dealing with this underload hangover, I'd call it, probably all through next year as we progress, largely in part because while we will improve the loadings and probably get beyond underload charges on a quarterly basis.\nWe'll still have all of that underload tied up in the cost of the wafers in inventory, and that still has to get flushed through before we're completely done. Meaningful improvement. I'd say we're largely out of the woods, but still some wood to chop through next year to where we're completely clean of underload.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Aaron. Jonathan, I think we have time for one last caller.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our final question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your question please.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Before I started, I just wanted to say a bit, Pat, Dave, and all the Intel folks. We're thinking about all your folks in Israel. Maybe you'll take these questions that I need to ask with due reverence to that. Unlike a lot of your competitors and peers, you guys actually have operations and fabs in Israel. Maybe you could give us a little bit of an update there on how things are going operationally, just given the atrocities that have gone on, what the size of the wafer outputs of those fabs are, what nodes they're on, any kind of details there would be really helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, yeah. Hey, as one of the earliest companies in Israel, now almost 50 years that were in country, I appreciate deeply these are the Intel team, this is people that I consider friends personally as well. That said, the resilience of the Intel team is remarkable. Despite all of these challenges, we'll say they're not missing a single commitment. They're performing extremely well. We continue to deliver the products that they're working on and continuing to drive the factory operations and our factory expansions that we have there. That's one of the benefits of Intel's multi-geo supply chain that we uniquely have in the industry is resilience. Intel 7 is running in the factory there in Israel.\nWe also have two other locations that we run Intel 7. We're making sure that we have the resilience of our supply chain for all of those products so that we can be very assured. Even as we're highly confident in the capabilities of our Intel Israel team to continue to perform despite the atrocities, we're also confident that we have a resilience in our core business model that gives us flexibility to assure supply and continued operation across the globe. Regardless of what issue you may have in Asia, Americas, Europe, Middle East, we are well positioned to deliver that for our customers across all of our operations.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCorporate VP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nMatt, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, I do, and thanks for that. Pat, as my follow-up, one of the things that I keep getting asked about a ton is the CapEx swing that's happened towards GenAI infrastructure. I guess the way that I've been phrasing the question is the video killed the radio star question. Is this the death of CPU growth in the data center. I don't think it is, to be clear, but there's some out there that do. Pat, you made some comments in your script and then some other answers about return to normalcy on data center CPU from a growth perspective. Maybe you could give a few data points or anecdotes that might support that. Thank you.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and I do think there's clearly been the surge of interest in GenAI, which has over a couple of quarters driven a bias on the part of the cloud guys in particular to where do they put their floor space, where do they put their power budgets. That's been driving largely a race for the largest system environments that they can put in place. That said, training of these large models is interesting, but the deployment of those models, the inferencing use of those models is what we believe is truly spectacular for the future. Some of that will run on the accelerators, but a huge amount of that is going to run on Xeons as we bring AI into those applications or AI-fication of existing applications.\nGiven the leadership performance that we have on our Gen4 for AI applications, that gets better with Gen5. When we deliver Granite Rapids, it gets 2-3x better. As I said in the comments, it gets even better as we go further out into the roadmap. The ability for us to do inferencing at scale on our Xeon product line we think is very profound as we go forward. The roadmap is very healthy. The combination of Gaudi and our Xeons, that is exactly what you heard Dell announce in their roadmap.\nWe're just seeing, I'll say, the normalcy of that in the buying behavior. We saw a very good uptick for our OEMs this quarter as they're seeing their Xeon businesses. We're also seeing more ecosystem embrace our DevCloud, lots of customers coming on it for both AI use cases on Xeon and on Gaudi. Key announcements like we had from Deloitte as they're partnering with us across application optimization as well as AI development on Xeon platform.\nOverall we feel pretty comfortable that we're in a cycle that there will be growth in CPUs led by Xeon as well as accelerators. Intel is going to be participating in both of those capacities in meaningful ways. This is part of what we said is AI everywhere. AI at the Edge, AI at the client, AI in the data center, and AI in the cloud. Inferencing will be the discussion topic for the industry as we go into 2024. That'll be done at scale and much of that is going to be done on Xeon’s.\nWith that, thank you for joining us. Again, I want to reiterate our thoughts for our resilient Intel team in Israel and for all of those in the region that are affected by recent events. I also want to thank you for joining us on the call again today and your interest in Intel. We appreciate the opportunity to update you, answer your questions, respond to that. Most important, we're excited by the momentum we're seeing, or as I said, the financial results were great. The operational results were truly outstanding this quarter. It's a confirmation of our Foundry strategy, of our five nodes everywhere, of our AI everywhere strategy.\nWe do hope that you're able to join us for our launch of Emerald Rapids, Gen5, Meteor Lake, Core Ultra in New York City in December. I do also hope to see you all at our Q1 Intel Foundry Day. Thank you, good afternoon, good night. Wherever in the world you be. Take care and be safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now you should have received a copy of the Q2 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com, for those joining us online. The earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment we will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q and A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our discussion also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.\nOur earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you John and good afternoon everyone. Our strong second quarter results exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line, demonstrating continued financial improvement and confirmation of our strategy in the marketplace. Effective execution across our process and product roadmaps is rebuilding customer confidence in Intel. Strength in client and data center, and our efforts to drive efficiencies and cost savings across the organization all contributed to the upside in the quarter and a return to profitability. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic roadmap, achieving our long-term goals and maximizing shareholder value.\nIn Q2 we began to see real benefits from our accelerating AI opportunity. We believe we are in a unique position to drive the best possible TCO for our customers at every node on the AI continuum. Our strategy is to democratize AI, scaling it and making it ubiquitous across the full continuum of workloads and usage models. We are championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge, and client across data prep, training, and inference in both discrete and integrated solutions.\nAs we have previously outlined, AI is one of our five superpowers, along with pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute, cloud to edge infrastructure, and sensing underpinning a 1 trillion semi industry by 2030. Intel Foundry Services or IFS positions us to further capitalize on the AI market opportunity as well as the growing need for a secure, diversified, and resilient global supply chain. IFS is a significant accelerant to our IDM 2.0 strategy and every day of geopolitical tension reinforces the correctness of our strategy. IFS expands our scale, accelerates our ramps at the leading edge, and creates long tails at the trailing edge. More importantly for our customers, it provides choice leading edge capacity outside of Asia and at 18A beyond what we believe will deliver leadership performance.\nWe are executing well on our Intel 18A as a key foundry offering and continue to make substantial progress against our strategy. In addition, in July we announced that Boeing and Northrop Grumman will join the RAMP-C program along with IBM, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes - Commercial, or RAMP-C, is a program created by the US Department of Defense in 2020 to assure domestic access to next-generation semiconductors, specifically by establishing and demonstrating a US-based foundry ecosystem to develop and fabricate chips on Intel 18A. RAMP-C continues to build on recent customer and partner announcements by IFS, including MediaTek, Arm, and the leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider. We also made good progress on two significant 18A opportunities this quarter.\nWe are strategically investing in manufacturing capacity to further advance our IDM 2.0 strategy and overarching foundry ambitions while adhering to our Smart Capital strategy. In Q2, we announced an expanded investment to build two leading-edge semiconductor facilities in Germany as well as plans for a new assembly and test facility in Poland. The building out of Silicon Junction in Magdeburg is an important part of our go-forward strategy, and with our investment in Poland, and the Ireland sites we already operate at scale in the region. We are encouraged to see the passage of the EU CHIPS Bill supporting our building out an unrivaled capacity corridor in Europe. In addition, a year after being signed into law, we submitted our first application for US CHIPS funding for the on-track construction of our FAB expansion in Arizona, working closely with the US Department of Commerce.\nIt all starts with our process and product roadmaps, and I am pleased to report that all our programs are on or ahead of schedule. We remain on track to five nodes in four years and to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Looking specifically at each node, Intel 7 is done, and with the second half launch of Meteor Lake, Intel 4, our first EUV node, is essentially complete, with production ramping for the remaining three nodes. I would highlight Intel 3 met defect density and performance milestones in Q2, released PDK 1.1, and is on track for overall yield and performance targets. We will launch Sierra Forest in H1 2024 with Granite Rapids following shortly thereafter are lead vehicles for Intel 3. On Intel 20A, our first node using both RibbonFET and PowerVia.\nArrow Lake, a volume client product, is currently running its first stepping in the fab in Q2. We announced that we will be the first to implement backside power delivery in silicon two plus years ahead of the industry, enabling power savings, area efficiency, and performance gains for increased compute demands ideal for use cases like AI scale, CPUs, and graphics. In addition, backside power improves ease of design, a major benefit not only for our own products, but even more so for our Foundry customers. On Intel 18A, we continue to run internal and external test chips and remain on track to being manufacturing ready in the second half of 2024. Just this week, we were pleased to have announced an agreement with Ericsson to partner broadly on their next generation optimized 5G infrastructure, reinforcing customer confidence in our roadmap.\nEricsson will be utilizing Intel's 18A process technology for its future custom 5G SoC offerings. Moving to products. Our client business exceeded expectations and gained share yet again in Q2 as the group executed well, seeing a modest recovery in the consumer and education segments as well as strength in premium segments where we have leadership performance. We have worked closely with our customers to manage client CPU inventory down to healthy levels as we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives. We see a sustained recovery in the second half of the year as inventory has normalized. Importantly, we see the AIPC as a critical inflection point for the PC market over the coming years that will rival the importance of Centrino and Wi-Fi in the early 2000s, and we believe that Intel is very well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth opportunity.\nIn addition, we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs as household density is stable to increasing across most regions and usage remains above pre-pandemic levels.\nBuilding on strong demand for our 13th Gen Intel processor family, Meteor Lake is ramping well in anticipation of a Q3 ramp and will maintain and extend our performance, leadership, and share gains over the last four quarters. Meteor Lake will be a key inflection point in our client processor roadmap as the first PC platform built on Intel 4, our first EUV node, and the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance. Meteor Lake will also feature a dedicated AI engine, Intel AI Boost. With AI Boost, our integrated neural VPU enabling dedicated low power compute for AI workloads, we will bring AI use cases to life through key experiences people will want and need for hybrid work productivity, sensing, security, and creator capabilities, many of which were previewed at Microsoft's Build 2023 conference.\nFinally, while making the decision to end direct investment in our Next Unit of Computing or NUC business, this well-regarded brand will continue to scale effectively with our recently announced ASUS partnership in the data center. Our 4th Gen Xeon Scalable processor is showing strong customer demand despite the mixed overall market environment. I am pleased to say that we are poised to ship our 1,000,000th 4th Gen Xeon unit in the coming days. This quarter we also announced the general availability of 4th Gen cloud instances by Google Cloud. We also saw great progress with 4th Gen's AI acceleration capabilities, and we now estimate more than 25% of Xeon data center shipments are targeted for AI workloads.\nAlso in Q2, we saw third-party validation from MLCommons when they published MLPerf training performance benchmark data showing that 4th Gen Xeon and Habana Gaudi 2 are two strong open alternatives in the AI market that compete on both performance and price versus the competition. End-to-end AI-infused applications like DeepMind's AlphaFold and algorithm areas such as graph neural networks show our 4th Gen Xeon outperforming other alternatives, including the best published GPU results. Our strengthening positioning within the AI market was reinforced by our recent announcement of our collaboration with Boston Consulting Group to deliver enterprise-grade secure and responsible generative AI, leveraging our Gaudi and 4th Gen Xeon offerings to unlock business value while maintaining high levels of security and data privacy.\nOur Data Center CPU roadmap continues to get stronger and remains on or incrementally ahead of schedule with Emerald Rapids, our 5th-gen Xeon Scalable set to launch in Q4 2023. Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3, will launch in H1 2024. Granite Rapids will follow shortly thereafter. For both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, volume validation with customers is progressing ahead of schedule. Multiple Sierra Forest customers have powered on their boards and silicon is hitting all power and performance targets. Clearwater Forest, the follow-on to Sierra Forest, will come to market in 2025 and be manufactured on Intel 18A.\nWhile we performed ahead of expectations, the Q2 consumption TAM for servers remains soft on persistent weakness across all segments, but particularly in the enterprise, and rest of world where the recovery is taking longer than expected. Across the entire industry, we see the server CPU inventory digestion persisting in the second half, additionally impacted by the near term wallet share focus on AI accelerators rather than general purpose compute in the cloud. We expect Q3 server CPUs to modestly decline sequentially before recovering in Q4. Longer term, we see AI as TAM expansive to server CPUs, and more importantly, we see our accelerator product portfolio is well positioned to gain share in 2024 and beyond.\nThe surging demand for AI products and services is expanding the pipeline of business engagements for our accelerator products, which includes our Gaudi, Flex, and Max product lines. Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share. The value of our AI products is demonstrated by the public instances of Gaudi at AWS and the new commitments to our Gaudi product line from leading AI companies such as Hugging Face and Stability AI, in addition to emerging AI leaders including IIT Madras Pravartak, and Genesis Cloud. In addition to building near term momentum with our family of accelerators, we continue to make key advancements in next generation technologies, which present significant opportunities for Intel.\nIn Q2, we shipped our test chip Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit silicon-based quantum chip which uniquely leverages decades of transistor design and manufacturing investments and expertise. Tunnel Falls fabrication achieved 95% yield rate with voltage uniformity similar to chips manufactured under the more usual CMOS process with a single 300-millimeter wafer providing 24,000 quantum DOP test chips. We strongly believe our silicon approach is the only path to true cost-effective commercialization of quantum computing. A silicon-based qubit approach is a million times smaller than alternative approaches. Turning to PSG, NEX, and Mobileye, demand trends are relatively stronger across our broad-based markets like industrial, auto, and infrastructure. Although, as anticipated, NEX did see a Q2 inventory correction which we expect to continue into Q3.\nIn contrast, PSG, IFS, and Mobileye continue on a solid growth trajectory, and we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year on year and calendar year 2023 much better than third party expectations for a mid single digit decline in the semiconductor market excluding memory. Looking specifically at our Programmable Solutions Group, we delivered record results for a third consecutive quarter. In Q2, we announced the Intel Agilex 7 with the R-Tile chiplet, is shipping production qualified devices in volume to help customers accelerate workloads with seamless integration and the highest bandwidth processor interfaces. We have now PRQ'd 11 of the 15 new products we expected to bring to market in calendar year 2023 for Nex. During Q2, Intel, Ericsson, and HPE successfully demonstrated the industry's first vRAN solution running on the 4th-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor with Intel vRAN Boost.\nIn addition, we will enhance the collaboration we announced at Mobile World Congress to accelerate industry-scale Open RAN utilizing standard Intel Xeon-based platforms as telcos transform to a foundation of programmable software-defined infrastructure. Mobileye continued to generate strong profitability in Q2 and demonstrated impressive traction with their advanced product portfolio by announcing a Supervision eyes-on, hands-off design win with Porsche and the Mobility as a Service collaboration with Volkswagen Group that will soon begin testing in Austin, Texas. We continue to drive technical and commercial engagement with them, co-developing leading FMCW LiDAR products based on Intel Silicon Photonics technology and partnering to drive the software-defined automobile vision that integrates Mobileye ADAS technology with Intel's cockpit offerings. Additionally, in the second quarter we executed a secondary offering that generated meaningful proceeds as we continue to optimize our value creation efforts.\nIn addition to executing on our process and product roadmaps during the quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023 and $8 to 10 billion exiting 2025. As mentioned during our internal foundry webinar, our new operating model establishes a separate PL for our manufacturing group inclusive of IFS and TD, which enables us to facilitate and accelerate our efforts to drive best-in-class cost structure, de-risk our technology for external foundry customers, and fundamentally changes incentives to drive incremental efficiencies. We have already identified numerous gains in efficiency including factory loading, test and sort time reduction, packaging cost improvements, litho field utilization improvements, reductions and steppings expedites, and many more. It is important to underscore the inherent sustained value creation due to the tight connection between our business units and TD manufacturing, and IFS.\nFinally, as we continue to optimize our portfolio, we agreed to sell a minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business to Bain Capital, brings a long history of partnering with companies to drive growth and value creation. IMS has created a significant market position with multi-beam mask writing tools that are critical to the semiconductor ecosystem for enabling EUV technology, and is already providing benefit on our five-node, four-year efforts. Further, this capability becomes even more critical with the adoption of high-NA EUV in the second half of the decade as we continue to keep Moore's Law alive and very well. IMS is a hidden gem within Intel, and the business's growth will be exposed and accelerated through this transaction. While we still have work to do, we continue to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy.\nFive nodes in four years remains well on track, our product execution and roadmap is progressing well, we continue to build out our foundry business, and we are seeing early signs of success as we work to truly democratize AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge, and client. We also saw strong momentum on our financial discipline and cost savings as we return to profitability, are executing our internal foundry model by 2024, and are leveraging our Smart Capital strategy to effectively and efficiently position us for the future. With that, I will turn it over.\nTo Dave,\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nthank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove stronger than expected business results in the second quarter, comfortably beating guidance on both the top and bottom line. While we expect continued improvement to global macroeconomic conditions, the pace of recovery remains moderate. We will continue to focus on what we can control, prioritizing investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively managing expenses near term, and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term. Second quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, more than $900 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations in CCG, DCAI, IFS, and Mobileye, partially offset by continued demand softness and elevated inventory levels in the network and edge markets, which impacted NEX results. Gross margin was 39.8%, 230 basis points better than guidance on stronger revenue.\nEPS for the quarter was $0.13, beating guidance by $0.17 as our revenue strength, better gross margin, and disciplined OpEx management resulted in a return to profitability. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.8 billion, up $4.6 billion sequentially. Net inventory was reduced by $1 billion or 18 days in the quarter, and accounts receivable declined by $850 million or 7 days. As we continue to focus on disciplined cash management, net CapEx was $5.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $2.7 billion, and we paid dividends of a half billion dollars in the quarter. Our actions in the last few weeks, the completed secondary offering of Mobileye shares, and the upcoming investment in our IMS Nanofabrication business by Bain Capital will generate more than $2.4 billion of cash and help to unlock roughly $35 billion of shareholder value.\nThese actions further bolster our strong balance sheet and investment grade profile with cash and short term investments of more than $24 billion. Exiting Q2, we'll continue to focus on avenues to generate shareholder value from our broad portfolio of assets in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy. Moving to second quarter business unit results, CCG delivered revenue of $6.8 billion, up 18% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the quarter, as the pace of customer inventory burns slowed. As anticipated, we see the market moving toward equilibrium and expect shipments to more closely align to consumption in the second half. ASPs declined modestly in the quarter due to higher education shipments and sell through of older inventory.\nCCG showed outstanding execution in Q2, generating operating profit of $1 billion and improvement of more than $500 million sequentially on higher revenue, improved unit costs, and reduced operating expenses, offsetting the impact of pre PRQ inventory reserves in preparation for the second half launch of Meteor Lake. DCAI revenue was $4 billion ahead of expectations and up 8% sequentially with the Xeon business up double digits sequentially. Data center CPU TAM contracted meaningfully in H1 2023 and while we expect the magnitude of year over year declines to diminish in the second half, a slower than anticipated TAM recovery in China and across enterprise markets has delayed a return of CPU TAM growth. CPU market share remained relatively stable in Q2 and the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids contributed to CPU ASP improvement of 3% sequentially and 17% year over year.\nDCAI had an operating loss of $161 million, improving sequentially on higher revenue and ASPs and reduced operating expenses within DCAI. Our FPGA products delivered a third consecutive quarter of record revenue, up 35% year over year, along with another record quarterly operating margin. We expect this business to return to more natural demand profile in the second half of the year as we work down customer backlog to normalized levels. NEX revenue was $1.4 billion below our expectations in the quarter and down significantly in comparison to a record Q2 2022. Network and edge markets are slowly working through elevated inventory levels, elongated by sluggish China recovery, and telcos have delayed infrastructure investments due to macro uncertainty. We see demand remaining weak through at least the third quarter. Q2 NEX operating loss of $187 million improved sequentially on lower inventory reserves and reduced operating expenses.\nMobileye continued to perform well in Q2. Revenue was $454 million, roughly flat sequentially and year over year, with operating profit improving sequentially to $129 million.\nThis morning, Mobileye increased fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 9% at the midpoint. Intel Foundry Services revenue was $232 million, up 4x year over year and nearly doubling sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS Nanofabrication tools. Operating loss was $143 million. With higher factory startup costs offsetting stronger revenue, Q2 was another strong quarter of cross-company spending discipline. With operating expenses down 14% year over year, we're on track to achieve $3 billion of spending reductions in 2023 with the decision to stop direct investment in our client NUC business earlier this month. We have now exited nine lines of business since Pat rejoined the company with a combined annual savings of more than $1.7 billion.\nThrough focused investment prioritization and austerity measures in the first half of the year, some of which are temporary in nature, OpEx is tracking a couple hundred million dollars better than our $19.6 billion 2023 committed goal. Now turning to Q3 guidance, we expect third quarter revenue of $12.9 to 13.9 billion at the midpoint of $13.4 billion. We expect client CPU shipments to more closely match sell through data center. Network and edge markets continue to face mixed macro signals and elevated inventory levels in the third quarter, while IFS and Mobileye are well positioned to generate strong sequential and year-over-year growth.\nWe're forecasting gross margin of 43%, a tax rate of 13%, and EPS of $0.20. At the midpoint of revenue guidance, we expect sequential margin improvement on higher sales and lower pre PRQ inventory reserves. While we're starting to see some improvement in factory under load charges, most of the benefit will take some time to run through inventory and positively impact cost of sales. Investment in manufacturing capacity continues to be guided by our Smart Capital framework, creating flexibility through proactive investment in shells and aligning equipment purchases to customer demand. In the last few weeks we have closed agreements with governments in Poland and Germany which include significant capital incentives and we're well positioned to meet the requirements of funding laid out by the US CHIPS Act.\nLooking at capital requirements and offsets made possible by our Smart Capital strategy, we expect net capital intensity in the mid-30s as a percentage of revenue across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate. While our expectations for gross CapEx have not changed, the timing of some capital offsets is uncertain and could land in either 2023 or 2024, depending on a number of factors. Having said that, we're confident in the level of capital offsets we will receive over the next 18 months and expect offsets to track to the high end of our previous range of 20 to 30%. Our financial results in Q2 reflect improved execution and improving macro conditions. Despite a slower than expected recovery in key consumption markets like China and the enterprise, we maintain our forecast of sequential revenue growth throughout the year.\nAccelerating AI use cases will drive increased demand for compute across the AI continuum. Intel is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in each of our business units. We remain focused on the execution of our near- and long-term product, process, and financial commitments and the prioritization of our owners' capital to generate free cash flow and create value for our stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our earnings presentation. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question with a brief follow-up question where appropriate. With that, Jonathan, can we have the first caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nStock Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Congrats on the strong results.\nWanted to focus, Pat, on the data.\nCenter, the DCAI side of things. Strong upside in the quarter, but it sounds like there's still some mixed trends going forward. So, I guess a two-part question: can you talk about what drove the upside, and where the concern is going forward? And part of that concern, that crowding.\nOur potential that you just discussed with.\nAccelerators versus CPUs, how is that playing out and when do you expect it to end?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks Ross. You know, thanks for the congrats on the quarter as well. I'm super proud of my team for the great execution this quarter. Top, bottom line beats raise, you know, and just great execution across every aspect of the business, both financially as well as roadmap execution. You know, with regard to the data center, you know, obviously the good execution. I'll just say we executed well. You know, winning designs, fighting hard in the market, regaining our momentum. Good execution. As you said, we'll see the Sapphire Rapids at the millionth unit in the next couple days, our Xeon Gen 4. So overall it's feeling good. Roadmaps in very good shape. So we're feeling very good about the future outlook of the business as well. You know, as we look to 5th-gen E-core, P-core with Sapphire and Granite Rapids.\nSo all of those, I'll just say we're performing well. You know, that said, we do think that the next quarter at least will show some softness. There's some inventory burn that we're still working through. We do see that big cloud customers in particular have put a lot of energy into building out their high-end AI training environments, and that is putting more of their budgets focused or prioritized into the AI portion of their build out. You know, that said, we do think this is a near-term right surge that we expect will balance over time. We see AI as a workload, not as a market. Right. Which will affect every aspect of the business, whether it's client, whether it's edge, whether it's standard data center on premise, enterprise, or cloud.\nYou know, we're also seeing that Gen 4 Xeon, and then we'll be enhancing that in the future. Roadmap has significant AI capabilities, and as you heard in the prepared remarks, we expect about 25% today and growing of our Gen 4 is being driven by AI use cases. Obviously we're going to be participating more in the accelerator portion of the market with our Gaudi Flex and Max product lines. Particularly Gaudi is gaining a lot of momentum. In my formal remarks we said we now have over $1 billion of pipeline 6x in the last quarter, so we're going to participate in the accelerator portion of it. We're seeing real opportunity for the CPU as that workload balances over time between CPU and accelerator. Obviously we have a strong position to democratize AI across our entire portfolio of products.\nRoss, do you have a quick follow up? I do.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nStock Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nI just wanted to pivot to Dave on a question.\nOn the gross margin side, nice beat in the quarter and a sequential increase for the third quarter as well beyond the rep increase side, which I know is important. Can you just walk us through some of the pluses and minuses sequentially into the third quarter and even into the back half? Some of the pre PRQ reversals, under utilization, any of those kind of idiosyncratic blocks that we should be aware of as we think about the.\nGross margin in the second half of the year?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, good question, Ross. So in Q2, just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, that was largely a function of revenue. We had obviously beat revenue significantly, and we got a good fall through given the fixed cost nature of our business. And so that really was what helped us really outperform significantly on the gross margin side in Q2. In Q3, we do obviously at the midpoint see revenue growth sequentially, and so that will be helpful in terms of gross margin improvement. We expect again pretty good fall through as we get that incremental revenue. We're also going to see underloadings come down, I would say modestly come down for two reasons. One, we get that period charge for some of our underloading, but some of our underloading is actually just a function of the cost of the inventory.\nSo that takes some time to flow through. So it'll be more, it'll be a modest decline, but nevertheless helpful on the gross margin front. And then as you point out, we will have pre PRQ reserves in Q3, but they're meaningfully down from Q2. You know, Meteor Lake will not be a pre PRQ reserve in Q3 because we expect to launch that this quarter. But you know, we have Emerald Rapids that will, that will certainly have some impact. And then you know, some of the other SKUs will also impact it. So, you know, coming down, but you know, not to zero. So we have an opportunity actually to perform better in Q4, you know, obviously dependent on the revenue and so forth.\nGiven that prep RQ reserves are likely to come off again in the fourth quarter, we should improve on the loading front in the fourth quarter as well. And so there's some, I think some good tailwinds on the gross, on the gross margin front. You know, I'll just take an opportunity to talk longer term. You know, we will continue to be weighed down for some quarters on underload because of the nature of just having it cycle through inventory and then come out through cost of sale. So for multiple quarters we'll have some underloading charges that we'll see. And then as we talked about since really Pat joined and we kind of launched into the five nodes, in four years we're going to have a significant amount of startup costs that will hit gross margins that will affect us for a couple of years.\nWe're really optimistic about where gross margins are going over the long term. Ultimately we will get back to process parity and leadership, and that will enable us to not have these startup costs be a headwind. Of course, as you bring out products at a high performance in terms of process and in terms of product, that shows up in terms of our margins. Then as Pat mentioned, you went through a laundry list in the prepared remarks of areas of benefit that the internal foundry model will give us. We expect a pretty meaningful amount of that to come out by the time we hit 2026, but we won't be done there. I mean, I think there'll be multiple opportunities over the course of multiple years to improve the gross margin.\nSo, you know, Pat has, you know, talked about a pretty significant improvement in gross margins over time. And I think, you know, what we're seeing today is the beginnings of seeing that improvement show up in the P and L. Ross, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next one please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from the.\nLine of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\nYour question please.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. Dave, I think you said in your prepared remarks that data center pricing was up 17% year over year and that Sapphire Rapids was a factor there. Can you just talk to that? And kind of obviously Sapphire Rapids is going to get bigger. You know, can you talk about what you expect to see with platform cost and DC AI platform costs?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nOkay, well, first of all, you know, ASP is obviously improving as we increase core count and you know, as we get more competitive on the product offerings, that enables us to, you know, to have more confidence in the market in terms of our pricing. So that, that's certainly helpful. Obviously with the increasing core count, that that affects the cost as well.\nSo cost is obviously goes up, but you know, the longer the larger drivers of, of our cost structure will be around. You know, what we do in terms of the internal, internal foundry model as we get up in terms of scale and get away from these underloading charges and as we get past the startup costs on five nodes in four years, which data center is certainly getting hit with. And so those things, I think longer term will be the biggest drivers of gross margin improvement. And as we get launch Sierra Forest in the first half of next year and Granite later thereafter and start to, to produce products on the data center side that are really competitive, that enables us to even be stronger in terms of our margin outlook and should help improve the overall P&L of data center.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a follow up question?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure.\nJust also on servers, as you look to Q3, I think you talked about some of the.\nCautious trends there. Can you talk to enterprise versus cloud? Is it different between the two? And also do you see, you know, are you seeing anything different in China for data center versus what you're seeing in North America?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and as we said, Joe, and thanks for the question. You know, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect, you know, to be seeing the TAM down in Q3 somewhat driven by all of it. It's a little bit of data center digestion for the cloud guys, a bit of enterprise weakness, you know, and some of that is more inventory, and you know, the China market I think has been well reported, you know, hasn't come back as strongly as people would have expected overall. And then the last factor was the one of the first question from Ross around the pressure from accelerator spend being stronger. So I think those four somewhat together, right, are leading to a bit of weakness at least through Q3. You know, that said, our overall position is strengthening and we're seeing our products improve, right.\nWe're seeing the benefits of the AI capabilities in our Gen 4 and beyond products improving. We're also starting to see some of the use cases like graph neural networks, Google's AlphaFold showing best results on CPUs as well, which is increasingly gaining momentum in the industry as people look for different aspects of data preparation, data processing, you know, different innovations in AI. So all of that taken together, we feel optimistic about the long-term outlook opportunities that we have in data center and, of course, the strengthening accelerator roadmap with Gaudi 2, 3, Falcon Shores being now well executed. Also, our first wafers are in hand for Gaudi 3. So, you know, we see a lot of long-term optimism even as near-term we're working through some of the challenging environments of the market not being as strong as we would have hoped.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore ISI, your question please.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question, in your prepared remarks you talked about AI being a TAM expander for servers. I guess I was hoping you could elaborate on that given the.\nProductivity gains through acceleration.\nWould love to hear why you think that will grow units and particularly if you could bifurcate your commentary across both training and inference?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and thanks, CJ Generally, there are great analogies here that from history we point to cases like virtualization was going to destroy, you know, the CPU TAM and then ended up driving new workloads. Right. You know, if you think about a DGX platform, the leading edge AI platform, it includes CPUs, right. Why? Right. Head nodes, data processing, data prep dominate certain portions of the workload. You know, we also see, as we said, AI as a workload where, you know, you might spend, you know, 10 megawatts and months training a model, you know, but then you're going to use it very broadly for inferencing.\nWe do see with Meteor Lake ushering in the AI PC generation where you have tens of watts, you know, being responding in a second or two, and then AI is going to be in every hearing aid in the future, including mine, where it's, you know, 10microwatts and instantaneous. So we do see as AI drives workloads across the full spectrum of applications. For that we're going to build AI into every product that we build, you know, whether it's a client, whether it's an edge platform, you know, for retail, manufacturing, and industrial use cases, whether it's an enterprise data center where they're not going to stand up a dedicated 10megawatt farm, but they're not going to move, you know, their private data off premises.\nRight.\nUse foundational models that are available and open source as well as in the big cloud and training environments as well. We firmly believe this idea of democratizing AI, opening the software stack, creating, and participating with this broad industry ecosystem that's emerging. It was a great opportunity and one that Intel is well positioned to participate in. We've seen that the AI TAM is part of the semiconductor TAM. We've always described this trillion-dollar semiconductor opportunity and AI being one of those superpowers, as I call it, of IDM. But it's not the only one and one that we're going to participate in broadly across our portfolio.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nCJ, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, please. You talked a little bit about 18A and backside power. Would love to hear what you're seeing today in terms of both scaling and power benefits and how your potential foundry customers are looking at that technology in particular.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you. We continue to make good progress on our five nodes four years, and with that, you know, that culminates in 18A, and 18A is proceeding well. And we got particularly good response this quarter, you know, to PowerVia, the backside power that we believe is a couple of years ahead, you know, as the industry measures it against any other alternative in the industry. We're very affirmed by the Ericsson announcement, which is reinforcing the strong belief they have in 18A. But over and above that, I mentioned in the prepared remarks the two major significant opportunities that we made very good progress on as big 18A foundry customers this quarter, and an overall growing pipeline of potential foundry customers, test chips, and process as well. So, you know, we feel five nodes and four years is on track.\n18A is the culmination of that and good interest from the industry across the board. I'd also say that as part of the overall strength in the foundry business as well. And maybe tying the first part and the second part of your question together is that our packaging technologies are particularly interesting in the marketplace, an area that Intel never stumbled. This is an area of sustained leadership that we've had, and today many of the big AI machines are packaging limited, and because of that we're finding a lot of interest for our advanced packaging. And this is an area of immediate strength for the foundry business. You know, we set up a specific packaging business unit within our foundry business and finding a lot of great opportunities for us to pursue there as well.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nCJ, thanks for the questions, Jonathan. Can we have the next caller please?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot.\nFirst Dave, I have one for you.\nIf I look at the third party.\nContributions, they were down a little bit, which was a little bit of a surprise.\nBut you did say that the Arizona.\nFab is on track. Can you sort of talk about that? And I know last quarter you said gross CapEx would be first half weighted.\nThe offsets would be back half weighted.\nIs that still the case?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. So we did manage CapEx a bit better than I was hoping. We thought it would be more front end loaded. It's looking; it's going to be a lot more evenly distributed first half versus the second half. And we managed CapEx in particular this quarter really well, which I think obviously helped on the free cash flow side. It's kind of a, when you manage the CapEx, you get less offsets, and so that, that kind of drove the lower capital offsets for the quarter. But for the year we're still on track to get the same amount of capital offsets through CHIPS that we had anticipated. And that's really where most of the capital offsets have come so far.\nNow obviously, you know, as we get into, you know, CHIPS incentives that should be coming here in the not too distant future, you know, that will add to the offsets that we get. We go into next year, we start getting the investment tax credit that will help on the capital offset. So there'll be more things that come in the future. But right now it's largely CapEx and it's CapEx one and that's a function of where the spending lands quarter to quarter. Yeah.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nAnd just maybe to pile onto that a bit, obviously getting EU CHIPS Act approved. We're excited about that. For the Germany and Poland projects, which are, we'll go for formal DG COMP approval. We're also very happy we submitted our first proposal, the OnTrack Arizona facility. But we'll have three more proposals going in for US CHIPS Act this quarter. And so we're now at pace for those. So everything there is feeling exactly as we said it would and super happy with the great engagement both in Europe as well as with the US Department of Commerce as we're working on those application processes.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a follow up question?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, yeah. Pat, so you talked about an accelerated pipeline of more than a billion, and I think Sandra has been recently implying.\nThat you could do over a billion.\nDollars in Gaudi next year. So the question is, is that the commitment?\nThen also at the Data Center Day you had talked about merging the GPU and the Gaudi roadmaps into.\nFalcon Shores, but that's not going.\nTo come out until 2025.\nSo the question really there is wondering where that leaves customers in terms of their commitment to your roadmap, given those changes.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and let me take that, and Dave can add. Overall, as we said, the accelerator pipeline is now well over $1 billion and growing rapidly about 6x this past quarter. That's led by, but not exclusively, Gaudi. That also includes the Max and Flex product lines as well. But the lion's share of that is Gaudi. Gaudi 2 is the shipping volume product today. Gaudi 3 will be the volume product for next year, and then Falcon Shores in 2025. And we're already working on Falcon Shores 2 for 2026. So we have a simplified roadmap as we bring together our GPU and our accelerators into a single offering. But the progress that we're making with Gaudi 2, it becomes more generalized with Gaudi 3.\nThe software stack, our one API approach that we're taking, will give customers confidence that they have forward compatibility into Gaudi 3 and Falcon Shores. We'll just be broadening the flexibility of that software stack. You know, we're adding FP8; we just added PyTorch 2 support. Every step along the way it gets better. Broader use cases, more language models are being supported, more programmability is being supported in the software stack, and we're building that full right solution set as we deliver on the best of GPU and the best of matrix acceleration in the Falcon Shores timeline. Every step along the way it just gets better. Every software release gets better, every hardware release gets better along the way to cover more of the overall accelerator marketplace. As I said, we now have Gaudi 3 wafers; first ones are in hand.\nSo that program is looking very good. With this rapidly accelerating pipeline of opportunity, we expect that we'll be giving you very positive updates there in the future with both customers as well as expanded business opportunities.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next caller please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research.\nYour question please.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks a lot. Appreciate the question. Pat, you caught my attention with your comment about PCs next year or with AI having a Centrino moment. Do you mind just talking about that? And what, when Centrino took place, you know, it was very clear. We unplugged from the wires, and investors really grasped that. What is the aha moment with AI that's going to accelerate the client business and benefit Intel?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah, and you know, I think, you know, the real question is what applications are going to become AI-enabled. And today you're starting to see that, you know, people are going to the cloud and you know, goofing around with ChatGPT, writing a research paper and you know, that's like super cool, right? And kids are of course, you know, simplifying their homework assignments that way. But you're not going to do that for every client becoming AI-enabled. It must be done on the client for that to occur.\nRight?\nYou can't go to the cloud, you can't round trip to the cloud. All of the new effects, real time language translation in your Zoom calls, real time transcription, automation, inferencing, relevance, portraying generated content and gaming environments, real time creator environments being done through Adobe and others that are doing those as part of the client. New productivity tools, being able to do local, you know, legal brief generations on clients one after the other, right across every aspect of consumer, of.\nDeveloper and enterprise efficiency use cases. We see that there's going to be a raft of AI enablement, and those will be client centered. Those will also be at the edge. You can't round trip to the cloud. You don't have the latency, the bandwidth, or the cost structure to round trip, let's say inferencing in a local convenience store to the cloud. It will all happen at the edge and at the client. So with that in mind, we do see this idea of bringing AI directly into the client. And Meteor Lake, which we bring into the market in the second half of the year, is the first major client product that includes native AI capabilities.\nThe neural engine that we've talked about, and this will be a volume delivery, you know, that we will have, and we expect that Intel is the volume leader, you know, for the client footprint is the one that's going to truly democratize AI at the client and at the edge. We do believe that this will become a driver of the TAM because people will say, oh, I want those. No, you, those new use cases, they make me more efficient and more capable just like Centrino made me more efficient because I didn't have to plug into the wire. Right now I don't have to go to the cloud to get these use cases. I'm going to have them locally on my PC in real time and cost effective.\nWe see this as a true AI PC moment that begins with Meteor Lake in the fall of this year.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nBen, do you have a follow-up question, please?\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks, John. I wanted to double-click on your sequential guidance in the client business. There's been, you know, there's some concerns out there with investors that there was some demand pull-in in the second quarter. Given some comments from some others and just wanted to talk about your confidence for sequential growth in that business based on what you're seeing and if there.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nWas any more color there?\nYeah, let me start on that, and Dave can jump in. The biggest change quarter on quarter that we see is that we're now at healthy inventory levels, and we work through inventory Q4, Q1, and some in Q2. We now see the OEMs and the channel at healthy inventory levels. We continue to see solid demand signals for the client business from our OEMs, and even some of the end-of-quarter and early-quarter sail-through are clear indicators of good strength in that business. And obviously, we combine that with gaining share again in Q2. So we come into the second half of the year with good momentum and a very strong product line. So we feel quite good about the client business outlook.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI'd just add, normally over the last few quarters you've seen us identify in the 10-Q strategic sales that we've made where we've negotiated kind of attractive deals which have accelerated demand, let's call it. When you look at our 10-Q, which will either be filed late tonight or early tomorrow, you'll see that we don't have a number in there for this quarter, which is an indication of how little we did in terms of strategic purchases. So to your question of did we pull in demand? I think that's probably will give you a pretty good assessment of that.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nBen, thanks for the questions. Jonathan, can we have the next caller please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly.\nOur next question comes from the.\nLine of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James, your question please.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you, Pat. I have a question on AI as it relates to custom silicon. It's great to see that you announced a customer for 18A on custom silicon. But there's a huge demand, it seems like, for custom silicon on the AI front. I think some of your hyperscale customers are already successfully using custom silicon as an AI accelerator. So I'm just curious what your strategy for that market is. Is that a focus area for you? If so, do you have any engagements with customers right now? Yeah.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Srini. The simple answer is yes. I have multiple ways to play in this market. Obviously one of those is foundry customers. We have a good pipeline of foundry customers for 18A foundry opportunities. Several of those opportunities that we're investigating are exactly what you described. People looking to do their own unique versions of their AI accelerator components. We're engaging with a number of those. But some of those are going to be variations of Intel standard products. This is where the IDM 2.0 strength really comes to play, where they could be using some of our silicon, combining it with some of their silicon designs. With given our advanced packaging strength, that gives us another way to be participating in those areas.\nAnd of course that reinforces some of the near-term opportunities, which will just be packaging, right, where they already have designed with one of the other foundries. But we're going to be able to augment their capacity opportunities with immediately being able to engage with packaging opportunities. And we're seeing pipeline of those opportunities. So overall we agree that this is clearly going to be a market. We also see that some of the ones that you've seen most in the press are about particularly high-end training environments. But as we said, we see AI being infused in everything, and there's going to be AI chips for the edge, AI chips for the communications infrastructure, AI chips for sensing devices, and for automotive devices. And we see opportunities for us both as a product provider and as a foundry and technology provider across that spectrum.\nThat's part of the unique positioning that IDM 2.0 gives us for the future.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nSrini, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nYeah, it's for Dave. Dave, it's good to see the progress on the working capital front. I think previously you said your expectation is that free cash flow would turn positive sometime in H2. Just curious if that's still the expectation. And also on the gross margin front, is there any, I guess, PRQ charges that we should be aware of as we go into Q4?\nThank you.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nOkay. So let me just take a moment just to give the team credit on the second quarter in terms of working capital because we brought inventory down by $1 billion, our days sales outstanding on the AR front is down to 24 days, which is exceptional. So a lot of what you saw in terms of the improving free cash flow from Q1 to Q2 was working capital. So I think the team's done an outstanding job just really focusing on all the elements that drive free cash flow. Our expectation is still by the end of the year to get to break even free cash flow. There's no reason why we shouldn't achieve that. You know obviously the net CapEx might be a little different this year than we thought coming into the year.\nBut as we talked about, just the focus on free cash flow, the improved outlook in terms of the business, you know, we think we can, we can get to break even by the end of the year as it relates to pre PRQ reserves. In the fourth quarter, we're likely to have some, but it should be a pretty good quarter-over-quarter improvement from the third quarter, which.\nWas obviously a good quarter over quarter.\nImprovement from the second quarter.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nSrini, thanks for the questions, Jonathan. I think we have time for one last caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly.\nAnd our final question for today then.\nComes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I do have a quick follow up as well. Just kind of going back to the gross margin a little bit, I think Dave, when you guided this quarter, you talked about, just looking backwards, the PRQ impact was going to be about 250 basis points. I think there was also an under load impact that I think you guided to around 300 basis points. So I'm just curious, what were those numbers in this most recent quarter relative to kind of as we try and.\nFrame what the expectation is going forward?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, they were largely as expected, although it was off of a lower revenue number. So the absolute dollars were as expected. They had a little bit of less of an impact given the revenue. The revenue was higher, and both of those numbers, like I said, will be lower in the third quarter.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nAaron, do you have a quick follow-up?\nI do.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nJust real quickly on just kind of the AI narrative, you know we talk about Gaudi a lot in the pipeline build out. I'm curious as you look forward, you know, as part of that pipeline, you.\nNo, Pat, do you expect to see?\nDeployments in some of the hyperscale cloud guys and competing against, you know, directly, you know, some of the large competitors on the GPU front with Gaudi in cloud.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nSimple answer yes. Right. You know, everyone is looking for alternatives. You know, clearly the MLPerf numbers that we posted recently with Gaudi 2, you know, show very competitive numbers, you know, significant TCO benefits for customers. They're looking for alternatives. They're also looking for more capacity. So we're definitely engaged. You know, we already have Gaudi instances on AWS available today already, and some of the names that we described in our earnings call, Stability AI, Genesis Cloud. So some of these are the proven, I'll say at scale, tier 1 cloud providers, but some of the next generation ones are also engaging. So overall, you know, absolutely, we expect that to be the case. You know, we're also on our own dev cloud. We're making it easier for customers to test Gaudi more quickly.\nWith that we now have 1,000 customers who are taking advantage of the Intel Developer Cloud. You know, we're building a thousand-node Gaudi cluster so that they can be at scale, you know, with their testing a very large training environment. Overall, you know, the simple answer is yes, very much so. We're seeing a good pipeline of those opportunities. With that, let me just wrap up our time together today. You know, thank you. You know, we're grateful that you would join us today and we're thankful that we have the opportunity to update you on our business. Simply put, it was a very good quarter.\nYou know, we exceeded expectations on top line, on bottom line, we raised guidance, and we look forward to the continued opportunities that we have of accelerating our business and seeing the margin improvement that comes in the second half of the year. But even more important to me was the operational improvements that we saw. Good fiscal discipline, cost saving discipline, and best of all, the progress that we've made right on our execution, our process execution, product execution, the transformational journey that we're in. And I just want to say a big thank you to my team for having a very good quarter that we could tell you about today. We look forward to talking to you more particularly at our Innovation in September. You know, we'll be hosting an investor Q&A track, and we hope to see many, if not all, of you there.\nIt'll be a great time. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nSa.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for standing by, and welcome to Intel Corporation's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be.\nA question and answer session. To ask a question during the session.\nYou'll need to press star one one on your telephone. To remove yourself from the queue, simply.\nPress star 11 again.\nAs a reminder, today's program is being recorded. Now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q2 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com, for those joining us online. The earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our discussion also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.\nOur earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong second quarter results exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line, demonstrating continued financial improvement and confirmation of our strategy in the marketplace. Effective execution across our process and product roadmaps is rebuilding customer confidence in Intel. Strength in client and data center, and our efforts to drive efficiencies and cost savings across the organization, all contributed to the upside in the quarter and a return to profitability. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic roadmap, achieving our long-term goals, and maximizing shareholder value.\nIn Q2, we began to see real benefits from our accelerating AI opportunity. We believe we are in a unique position to drive the best possible TCO for our customers at every node on the AI continuum. Our strategy is to democratize AI, scaling it and making it ubiquitous across the full continuum of workloads and usage models. We are championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge, and client across data prep, training, and inference in both discrete and integrated solutions.\nAs we have previously outlined, AI is one of our five superpowers along with pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute, cloud to edge infrastructure, and sensing, underpinning a $1 trillion semi industry by 2030. Intel Foundry Services, or IFS, positions us to further capitalize on the AI market opportunity as well as the growing need for a secure, diversified, and resilient global supply chain. IFS is a significant accelerant to our IDM 2.0 strategy, and every day of geopolitical tension reinforces the correctness of our strategy. IFS expands our scale, accelerates our ramps at the leading edge, and creates long tails at the trailing edge. More importantly for our customers, it provides choice, leading edge capacity outside of Asia and at 18A and beyond, what we believe will deliver leadership performance.\nWe are executing well on our Intel 18A as a key foundry offering and continue to make substantial progress against our strategy. In addition, in July we announced that Boeing and Northrop Grumman will join the RAMP-C program along with IBM, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes Commercial or RAMP-C is a program created by the US Department of Defense in 2021 to assure domestic access to next-generation semiconductors, specifically by establishing and demonstrating a US-based foundry ecosystem to develop and fabricate chips on Intel 18A. RAMP-C continues to build on recent customer and partner announcements by IFS, including MediaTek, Arm, and a leading cloud, edge, and data center solutions provider. We also made good progress on two significant 18A opportunities this quarter.\nWe are strategically investing in manufacturing capacity to further advance our IDM 2.0 strategy and overarching foundry ambitions while adhering to our Smart Capital strategy. In Q2, we announced an expanded investment to build two leading-edge semiconductor facilities in Germany as well as plans for a new assembly and test facility in Poland. The building out of Silicon Junction in Magdeburg is an important part of our go-forward strategy, and, with our investment in Poland and the Ireland sites, we already operate at scale in the region. We are encouraged to see the passage of the EU CHIPS Bill supporting our building out an unrivaled capacity corridor in Europe. In addition, a year after being signed into law, we submitted our first application for US CHIPS funding for the on-track construction of our fab expansion in Arizona, working closely with the US Department of Commerce.\nIt all starts with our process and product roadmaps, and I am pleased to report that all our programs are on or ahead of schedule. We remain on track to five nodes in four years and to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025, looking specifically at each node. Intel 7 is done, and with the second half launch of Meteor Lake, Intel 4, our first EUV node, is essentially complete with production ramping for the remaining three nodes. I would highlight Intel 3 met defect density and performance milestones in Q2, released PDK 1.1, and is on track for overall yield and performance targets. We will launch Sierra Forest in H1 2024 with Granite Rapids following shortly thereafter.\nOur lead vehicles for Intel 3 on Intel 20A, our first node using both RibbonFET and PowerVia, Arrow Lake, a volume client product, is currently running its first stepping in the fab in Q2. We announced that we will be the first to implement backside power delivery in Silicon Valley two-plus years ahead of the industry, enabling power savings, area efficiency, and performance gains for increased compute demands, ideal for use cases like AI CPUs and graphics. In addition, backside power improves ease of design, a major benefit not only for our own products, but even more so for our Foundry customers. On Intel 18A, we continue to run internal and external test chips and remain on track to being manufacturing ready in the second half of 2024.\nJust this week we were pleased to have announced an agreement with Ericsson to partner broadly on their next generation optimized 5G infrastructure, reinforcing customer confidence in our roadmap. Ericsson will be utilizing Intel's 18A process technology for its future custom 5G SoC offerings. Moving to Products. Our client business exceeded expectations and gained share yet again in Q2 as the group executed well, seeing a modest recovery in the consumer, and education segments as well as strength in premium segments where we have leadership performance. We have worked closely with our customers to manage client CPU inventory down to healthy levels as we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives. We see a sustained recovery in the second half of the year as inventory has normalized.\nImportantly, we see the AI PC as a critical inflection point for the PC market over the coming years that will rival the importance of Centrino and Wi-Fi in the early 2000s, and we believe that Intel is very well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth opportunity. In addition, we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs as household density is stable to increasing across most regions and usage remains above pre-pandemic levels.\nBuilding on strong demand for our 13th Gen Intel processor family. Meteor Lake is ramping well in anticipation of a Q3 peak and will maintain and extend our performance, leadership, and share gains over the last four quarters. Meteor Lake will be a key inflection point in our client processor roadmap as the first PC platform built on Intel 4, our first EUV node, and the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance. Meteor Lake will also feature a dedicated AI engine, Intel AI Boost. With AI Boost, our integrated neural VPU enabling dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads, we will bring AI use cases to life through key experiences people will want and need for hybrid work productivity, sensing, security, and creator capabilities, many of which were previewed at Microsoft's Build 2023 conference.\nFinally, while making the decision to end direct investment in our Next Unit of Computing or NUC business, this well-regarded brand will continue to scale effectively with our recently announced ASUS partnership in the data center. Our 4th Gen Xeon Scalable processor is showing strong customer demand despite the mixed overall market environment. I am pleased to say that we are poised to ship our 1,000,000th 4th Gen Xeon unit in the coming days. This quarter we also announced the general availability of 4th Gen cloud instances by Google Cloud. We also saw great progress with 4th Gen's AI acceleration capabilities, and we now estimate more than 25% of Xeon data center shipments are targeted for AI workloads.\nAlso in Q2, we saw third-party validation from MLCommons when they published MLPerf training performance benchmark data showing that 4th Gen Xeon and Habana Gaudi 2 are two strong open alternatives in the AI market that compete on both performance and price versus the competition. End-to-end AI-infused applications like DeepMind's AlphaFold and algorithm areas such as graph neural networks show our 4th Gen Xeon outperforming other alternatives, including the best published GPU results. Our strengthening positioning within the AI market was reinforced by our recent announcement of our collaboration with Boston Consulting Group to deliver enterprise-grade secure and responsible generative AI, leveraging our Gaudi and 4th Gen Xeon offerings to unlock business value while maintaining high levels of security and data privacy.\nOur Data Center CPU roadmap continues to get stronger and remains on or incrementally ahead of schedule. With Emerald Rapids, our 5th Gen Xeon Scalable set to launch in Q4 2023. Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3, will launch in H1 2024. Granite Rapids will follow shortly thereafter. For both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, volume validation with customers is progressing ahead of schedule. Multiple Sierra Forest customers have powered on their boards, and silicon is hitting all power and performance targets. Clearwater Forest, the follow-on to Sierra Forest, will come to market in 2025 and be manufactured on Intel 18A. While we performed ahead of expectations, the Q2 consumption TAM for servers remains soft on persistent weakness across all segments, but particularly in the enterprise and rest-of-world, where the recovery is taking longer than expected.\nAcross the entire industry, we see the server CPU inventory digestion persisting in the second half, additionally impacted by the near term wallet share focus on AI accelerators rather than general purpose compute in the cloud. We expect Q3 server CPUs to modestly decline sequentially before recovering in Q4. Longer term, we see AI as TAM expansive to server CPUs, and more importantly, we see our accelerator product portfolio as well positioned to gain share in 2024 and beyond.\nThe surging demand for AI products and services is expanding the pipeline of business engagements for our accelerator products, which includes our Gaudi, Flex, and Max product lines. Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share. The value of our AI products is demonstrated by the public instances of Gaudi at AWS and the new commitments to our Gaudi product line from leading AI companies such as Hugging Face, and Stability AI in addition to emerging AI leaders including Indian Institute of Technology Madras Pravartak, and Genesis Cloud.\nIn addition to building near-term momentum with our family of accelerators, we continue to make key advancements in next-generation technologies which present significant opportunities for Intel. In Q2 we shipped our test chip Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit silicon-based quantum chip which uniquely leverages decades of transistor design and manufacturing investments and expertise. Tunnel Falls fabrication achieved 95% yield rate with voltage uniformity similar to chips manufactured under the more usual CMOS process with a single 300-millimeter wafer providing 24,000 quantum dot test chips. We strongly believe our silicon approach is the only path to true cost-effective commercialization of quantum computing. A silicon-based qubit approach is a million times smaller than alternative approaches. Turning to PSG, NEX, and Mobileye, demand trends are relatively stronger across our broad-based markets like industrial, auto, and infrastructure.\nAlthough, as anticipated, NEX did see a Q2 inventory correction, which we expect to continue into Q3. In contrast, PSG, IFS, and Mobileye continue on a solid growth trajectory, and we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year-on-year and calendar year 2023 much better than third-party expectations for a mid-single-digit decline in the semiconductor market excluding memory. Looking specifically at our Programmable Solutions group, we delivered record results for a third consecutive quarter. In Q2, we announced the Intel Agilex 7 with the R-Tile chiplet as shipping production-qualified design devices in volume to help customers accelerate workloads with seamless integration and the highest bandwidth processor interfaces. We have now PRQ'd 11 of the 15 new products we expected to bring to market in calendar year 2023 for NEX.\nDuring Q2, Intel, Ericsson, and HPE successfully demonstrated the industry's first vRAN solution running on the 4th-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel vRAN Boost. In addition, we will enhance the collaboration we announced at Mobile World Congress to accelerate industry-scale Open RAN utilizing standard Intel Xeon-based platforms as telcos transform to a foundation of programmable software-defined infrastructure. Mobileye continued to generate strong profitability in Q2 and demonstrated impressive traction with their advanced product portfolio by announcing a Supervision eyes-on, hands-off design win with Porsche and the Mobility as a Service collaboration with Volkswagen Group that will soon begin testing in Austin, Texas. We continue to drive technical and commercial engagement with them, co-developing leading FMCW LiDAR products based on Intel silicon photonics technology and partnering to drive the software-defined automobile vision that integrates Mobileye ADAS technology with Intel's cockpit offerings.\nAdditionally, in the second quarter we executed the secondary offering that generated meaningful proceeds as we continue to optimize our value creation efforts. In addition to executing on our process and product roadmaps during the quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023 and $8 to 10 billion exiting 2025. As mentioned during our internal foundry webinar, our new operating model establishes a separate PL for our manufacturing group inclusive of IFS and TD, which enables us to facilitate and accelerate our efforts to drive best in class cost structure, de risk our technology for external foundry customers, and fundamentally changes incentives to drive incremental efficiencies. We have already identified numerous gains in efficiency including factory loading, test and sort time reduction, packaging cost improvements, litho field utilization improvements, reductions in steppings expedites, and many more.\nIt is important to underscore the inherent sustained value creation due to the tight connection between our business units and TD manufacturing and IFS.\nFinally, as we continue to optimize our portfolio, we agreed to sell a minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business to Bain Capital, brings a long history of partnering with companies to drive growth and value creation. IMS has created a significant market position with multi-beam mask writing tools that are critical to the semiconductor ecosystem for enabling EUV technology, and is already providing benefit on our 5-node, four-year efforts. Further, this capability becomes even more critical with the adoption of high-NA EUV in the second half of the decade as we continue to keep Moore's Law alive and very well. IMS is a hidden gem within Intel, and the business's growth will be exposed and accelerated through this transaction. While we still have work to do, we continue to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy.\nFive nodes in four years remains well on track, our product execution and roadmap is progressing well, we continue to build out our Foundry business, and we are seeing early signs of success as we work to truly democratize AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge, and client. We also saw strong momentum on our financial discipline and cost savings as we return to profitability, are executing our internal foundry model by 2024, and are leveraging our Smart Capital strategy to effectively and efficiently position us for the future. With that, I will turn it over.\nTo Dave.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove stronger than expected business results in the second quarter, comfortably beating guidance on both the top and bottom line. While we expect continued improvement to global macroeconomic conditions, the pace of recovery remains moderate. We will continue to focus on what we can control, prioritizing investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively managing expenses near term and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term.\nSecond quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, more than $900 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations in CCG, DCAI, IFS, and Mobileye, partially offset by continued demand softness and elevated inventory levels in the network and edge markets, which impacted NEX results. Gross margin was 39.8%, 230 basis points better than guidance on stronger revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.13, beating guidance by $0.17 as our revenue strength, better gross margin, and disciplined OpEx management resulted in a return to profitability.\nQ2 operating cash flow was $2.8 billion, up $4.6 billion sequentially. Debt and inventory was reduced by $1 billion or 18 days in the quarter, and accounts receivable declined by $850 million or 7 days. As we continue to focus on disciplined cash management, net CapEx was $5.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $2.7 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. Our actions in the last few weeks, the completed secondary offering of Mobileye shares and the upcoming investment in our IMS Nanofabrication business by Bain Capital, will generate more than $2.4 billion of cash and help to unlock roughly $35 billion of shareholder value. These actions further bolster our strong balance sheet and investment grade profile with cash and short term investments of more than $24 billion.\nExiting Q2, we'll continue to focus on avenues to generate shareholder value from our broad portfolio of assets in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy. Moving to second quarter business unit results, CCG delivered revenue of $6.8 billion, up 18% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the quarter as the pace of customer inventory burns slowed. As anticipated, we see the market moving toward equilibrium and expect shipments to more closely align to consumption in the second half. ASPs declined modestly in the quarter due to higher education shipments and sell through of older inventory. CCG showed outstanding execution in Q2, generating operating profit of $1 billion, an improvement of more than $500 million sequentially on higher revenue, improved unit costs, and reduced operating expenses, offsetting the impact of pre PRQ inventory reserves in preparation for the second half launch of Meteor Lake.\nDCAI revenue was $4 billion ahead of expectations and up 8% sequentially with the Xeon business up double digits sequentially. Data center CPU TAM contracted meaningfully in H1 2023 and while we expect the magnitude of year over year declines to diminish in the second half, a slower than anticipated TAM recovery in China and across enterprise markets has delayed a return of CPU TAM growth. CPU market share remained relatively stable in Q2 and the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids contributed to CPU ASP improvement of 3% sequentially and 17% year over year. DCAI had an operating loss of $161 million, improving sequentially on higher revenue and ASPs, and reduced operating expenses within DCAI. Our FPGA products delivered a third consecutive quarter of record revenue, up 35% year over year along with another record quarterly operating margin.\nWe expect this business to return to more natural demand profile in the second half of the year as we work down customer backlog to normalized levels. NEX revenue was $1.4 billion below our expectations in the quarter and down significantly in comparison to a record Q2 2022. Network and Edge markets are slowly working through elevated inventory levels elongated by sluggish China recovery, and telcos have delayed infrastructure investments due to macro uncertainty. We see demand remaining weak through at least the third quarter. Q2 NEX operating loss of $187 million improved sequentially on lower inventory reserves and reduced operating expenses. Mobileye continued to perform well in Q2. Revenue was $454 million, roughly flat sequentially and year over year, with operating profit improving sequentially to $129 million. This morning, Mobileye increased fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 9%.\nAt the midpoint, Intel Foundry Services revenue was $232 million, up 4x year over year and nearly doubling sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS Nanofabrication tools. Operating loss was $143 million with higher factory startup costs offsetting stronger revenue. Q2 was another strong quarter of cross company spending discipline with operating expenses down 14% year over year. We're on track to achieve $3 billion of spending reductions in 2023 with the decision to stop direct investment in our client NUC business earlier this month. We have now exited nine lines of business since Pat rejoined the company with a combined annual savings of more than $1.7 billion.\nThrough focused investment, prioritization, and austerity measures in the first half of the year, some of which are temporary in nature, OpEx is tracking a couple hundred million dollars better than our $19.6 billion 2023 committed goal. Now turning to Q3 guidance, we expect third quarter revenue of $12.9 to 13.9 billion. At the midpoint of $13.4 billion, we expect client CPU shipments to more closely match sell-through data center. Network and edge markets continue to face mixed macro signals and elevated inventory levels in the third quarter, while IFS and Mobileye are well positioned to generate strong sequential and year-over-year growth.\nWe're forecasting gross margin of 43%, a tax rate of 13%, and EPS of $0.20. At the midpoint of Revenue guidance, we expect sequential margin improvement on higher sales and lower pre PRQ inventory reserves. While we're starting to see some improvement in factory under load charges, most of the benefit will take some time to run through inventory and positively impact cost of sales. Investment in manufacturing capacity continues to be guided by our Smart Capital framework, creating flexibility through proactive investment in shelves and aligning equipment purchases to customer demand. In the last few weeks we have closed agreements with governments in Poland and Germany which include significant capital incentives, and we're well positioned to meet the requirements of funding laid out by the US CHIPS Act.\nLooking at capital requirements and offsets made possible by our smart capital strategy, we expect net capital intensity in the mid-30s as a percentage of revenue across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate. While our expectations for gross CapEx have not changed, the timing of some capital offsets is uncertain and could land in either 2023 or 2024 depending on a number of factors. Having said that, we're confident in the level of capital offsets we will receive over the next 18 months and expect offsets to track to the high end of our previous range of 20% to 30%. Our financial results in Q2 reflect improved execution and improving macro conditions despite a slower than expected recovery in key consumption markets like China and the enterprise. We maintain our forecast of sequential revenue growth throughout the year.\nAccelerating AI use cases will drive increased demand for compute across the AI continuum. And Intel is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in each of our business units. We remain focused on the execution of our near- and long-term products, process, and financial commitments and the prioritization of our owner's capital to generate free cash flow and create value for our stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our earnings presentation. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question with a brief follow-up question where appropriate. With that, Jonathan, can we have the first caller please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly.\nOur first question comes from the.\nLine of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nStock Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask the question.\nCongrats on the strong results. Wanted to focus, Pat, on the data.\nCenter, the DCAI side of things. Strong upside in the quarter, but it sounds like there's still some mixed trends going forward. So, I guess a two-part question. Can you talk about what drove the upside and where the concern is going forward? And part of that concern, that crowding out potential that you just discussed with accelerators versus CPUs, how is that playing out in wind?\nDo you expect it to end?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks Ross. You know, thanks for the congrats on the quarter as well. I'm super proud of my team for the great execution this quarter. Top, bottom line beats raise, you know, and just great execution across every aspect of the business, both financially as well as roadmap execution. You know, with regard to the data center, you know, obviously the good execution. I'll just say we executed well. You know, winning designs, fighting hard in the market, regaining our momentum. Good execution. As you said, we'll see the Sapphire Rapids hit the millionth unit in the next couple days, our Xeon Gen 4. So overall it's feeling good. Roadmaps in very good shape.\nSo we're feeling very good about the future outlook of the business as well as we look to 5th-gen E-core, P-core with Sapphire Rapids and Granite Rapids. So all of those, I'll just say we're performing, performing well. You know, that said, we do think that the next quarter at least will show some softness. There's some inventory burn that we're still working through. We do see that big cloud customers in particular have put a lot of energy into building out their high-end AI training environments, and that is putting more of their budgets focused or prioritized into the AI portion of their build-out. You know, that said, we do think this is a near-term surge that we expect will balance over time. We see AI as a workload, not as a market. Right.\nWhich will affect every aspect of the business, whether it's client, whether it's edge, whether it's standard data center, on-premise, enterprise, or cloud. We're also seeing that Gen 4 Xeon and then we'll be enhancing that in the future. Roadmap has significant AI capabilities, and as you heard in the prepared remarks, we expect about 25% today and growing of our Gen 4 is being driven by AI use cases. Obviously we're going to be participating more in the accelerator portion of the market with our Gaudi Flex and Max product lines. Particularly Gaudi is gaining a lot of momentum. In my formal remarks we said we now have over $1 billion of pipeline 6x in the last quarter, so we're going to participate in the accelerator portion of it.\nYou know, we're seeing real opportunity for the CPU as that workload balances over time between CPU and accelerator. Obviously, you know, we have a strong position to democratize AI across our entire portfolio of products.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a quick follow up? I do.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nStock Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nI just wanted to pivot to Dave on a question.\nOn the gross margin side, nice beat in the quarter and the sequential increase.\nFor Q3 as well, beyond.\nThe revenue increase side, which I know is important. Important. Can you just walk us through some of the pluses and minuses sequentially into Q3 and even into the back half? Some of the pre PRQ reversals, underutilization, any of those kind of idiosyncratic blocks.\nThat we should be aware of as.\nWe think about the gross margin in.\nThe second half of the year.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, good question, Ross. So in Q2, just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, you know, that was largely a function of revenue. We had obviously beat revenue significantly, and we got a good flow-through given the fixed cost nature of our business. And so that really was what helped us really outperform significantly on the gross margin side in Q2. In Q3, we do obviously at the midpoint see revenue growth sequentially, and so that will be helpful in terms of gross margin improvement. We expect again pretty good flow-through as we get that incremental revenue. We're also going to see underloadings come down; I would say modestly come down for two reasons.\nOne, we get that period charge for some of our underloading, but some of our underloading is actually just a function of the cost of the inventory. So that will take some time to flow through. So it'll be more, it'll be a modest decline but nevertheless helpful on the gross margin front. And then as you point out, we will have pre PRQ reserves in Q3, but they're meaningfully down from Q2. You know, Meteor Lake will not be a pre PRQ reserve in Q3 because we expect to launch that this quarter. But you know, we have Emerald Rapids that will, that will certainly have some impact and then you know, some of the other SKUs will also impact it. So you know, coming down but you know, not to zero.\nSo we have an opportunity actually to perform better in the fourth quarter, you know, obviously dependent on the revenue and so forth. Given that pre PRQ reserves are likely to come off again in the fourth quarter, we should improve on the loading front in the fourth quarter as well. And so there's some, I think some good tailwinds on the gross, on the gross margin front. You know, I'll just take an opportunity to talk longer term. You know, we will continue to be weighed down for some quarters on under load because of the nature of just having it cycle through inventory and then come out through cost of sale. So for multiple quarters we'll have to some underloading charges that we'll see.\nThen, as we talked about, you know, for since really Pat joined and we, you know, kind of launched into the five nodes in four years, we're going to have a significant amount of startup costs that will hit gross margins that will affect us, you know, for a couple of years. But we're really optimistic about where gross margins are going over the, over the long term. You know, ultimately we will get back to process parity and leadership, and that will enable us to not have these startup costs be a headwind. And of course, as you bring out products at a high performance in terms of process and in terms of product, that shows up in terms of our margins.\nThen as Pat mentioned, he went through a laundry list in the prepared remarks of areas of benefit that the internal foundry model will give us. We expect a pretty meaningful amount of that to come out by the time we hit 2026, but we won't be done there. I mean, I think there'll be multiple opportunities over the course of multiple years to improve the gross margin. So, you know, Pat has talked about a pretty significant improvement in gross margins over time. And I think what we're seeing today is the beginnings of seeing that improvement show up in the P&L.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next one please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. Dave, I think you said in your prepared remarks that data center pricing was up 17% year over year and that Sapphire Rapids was a factor there. Can you just talk to that, and kind of obviously Sapphire Rapids is going to get bigger? You know, can you talk about what you expect to see with platform cost and DCAI platform costs?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nOkay, well, first of all, you know, AST is obviously improving as we increase core count, and you know, as we get more competitive on the product offerings, that enables us to, you know, to have more confidence in the market in terms of our pricing. So that, that's certainly helpful. Obviously with the increasing core count, that affects the cost as well.\nSo cost is obviously goes up, but you know, the longer the larger drivers of our cost structure will be around, you know, what we do in terms of the internal foundry model as we get up in terms of scale and get away from these underloading charges, and as we get past the startup costs on five nodes in four years, which Data Center is certainly getting hit with. And so those things, I think longer term will be the biggest drivers of gross margin improvement. And as we get launch Sierra Forest in the first half of next year and Granite later thereafter and start to produce products on the data center side that are really competitive, you know, that enables us to even be stronger in terms of our margin outlook and should help improve the overall P&L of Data Center.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a follow up question?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure.\nJust also on servers, as you look to Q3, I think you talked about some of the.\nCautious trends there. Can you talk to enterprise versus cloud? Is it different between the two? And also do you see, you know, are you seeing anything different in China for data center versus what you're seeing in North America?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation",
    "content3": "Yeah, and as we said, Joe, and thanks for the question. You know, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect, you know, to be seeing the TAM down in Q3 somewhat driven by all of it. It's a little bit of data center digestion for the cloud guys, a bit of enterprise weakness, you know, and some of that is more inventory. The China market I think has been well reported, hasn't come back as strongly as people would have expected overall. Then the last factor was the one of the first question from Ross around the pressure from accelerator spend being stronger. So I think those four somewhat together are leading to a bit of weakness at least through Q3. That said, our overall position is strengthening and we're seeing our products improve. Right.\nWe're seeing the benefits of the AI capabilities in our Gen 4 and beyond products improving. We're also starting to see some of the use cases like graph neural networks, Google's AlphaFold showing best results on CPUs as well, which is increasingly gaining momentum in the industry as people look for different aspects of data preparation, data processing, you know, different innovations in AI. So all of that taken together, we feel optimistic about the long-term upside opportunities that we have in data center and of course the strengthening accelerator roadmap with Gaudi 3, Falcon Shores being now well executed. Also our first wafers are in hand for Gaudi 3. So you know, we see a lot of long-term optimism even as near-term we're working through some of the challenging environments of the market not being as strong as we would have hoped.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore ISI.\nYour question please.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, in your prepared remarks you talked about AI being a TAM expander for servers. I guess I was hoping you could elaborate that on that given the productivity gains through acceleration. Would love to hear why you think that will grow units and particularly if you could bifurcate your commentary across both training and inference.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and thanks, CJ And generally, there are great analogies here that from history we point to, cases like virtualization was going to destroy, you know, the CPU TAM and then ended up driving new workloads. Right. You know, if you think about a DGX platform, the leading-edge AI platform, it includes CPUs, right. Why?\nRight.\nHead nodes, data processing, data prep dominate certain portions of the workload. You know, we also see, as we said, AI as a workload where, you know, you might spend, you know, 10MW and months training a model, you know, but then you're going to use it very broadly for inferencing. We do see with Meteor Lake ushering in the AI PC generation, where you have tens of watts, you know, being responding in a second or two, and then AI is going to be in every hearing aid in the future, including mine, where it's, you know, 10?W and instantaneous. So we do see as AI drives workloads across the full spectrum of applications.\nFor that we're going to build AI into every product that we build, you know, whether it's a client, whether it's an edge platform, you know, for retail, manufacturing, and industrial use cases, whether it's an enterprise data center where they're not going to stand up a dedicated 10-MW farm, but they're not going to move, you know, their private data off premises.\nRight.\nUse foundational models that are available in open source as well as in the big cloud and training environments as well. We firmly believe this idea of democratizing AI, opening the software stack, creating and participating with this broad industry ecosystem that's emerging; it was a great opportunity and one that Intel is well positioned to participate in. We've seen that the AI TAM is part of the semiconductor TAM. You know, we've always described this trillion-dollar semiconductor opportunity and AI being one of those superpowers, as I call it, of driving it. But it's not the only one and one that we're going to participate in broadly across our portfolio.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nCJ, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, please. You talked a little bit about 18A and backside power. Would love to hear what you're seeing today in terms of both scaling and power benefits, and how your potential foundry customers are looking at that technology in particular.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you. And you know, we continue to make good progress on our five nodes in four years. And with that, you know, that culminates in 18A, and 18A is proceeding well. And we got particularly good response this quarter to PowerVia, the backside power, that we believe is a couple of years ahead, as the industry measures it against any other alternative in the industry. We're very affirmed by the Ericsson announcement, which is reinforcing the strong belief they have in 18A. But over and above that, I mentioned in the prepared remarks the two major significant opportunities that we made very good progress on as big 18A foundry customers this quarter, and an overall growing pipeline of potential foundry customers, test chips, and process as well. So, you know, we feel five nodes in four years is on track.\n18A is the culmination of that, and good interest from the industry across the board. You know, I'd also say that, you know, as part of the overall strength in the foundry business as well. Maybe tying the first part and the second part of your question together is that our packaging technologies are particularly interesting in the marketplace, an area that Intel never stumbled. This is an area of sustained leadership that we've had. Today many of the big AI machines are packaging limited, and because of that we're finding a lot of interest for our advanced packaging. This is an area of immediate strength for the foundry business. You know, we set up a specific packaging business unit within our foundry business and finding a lot of great opportunities for us to pursue there as well.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nCJ, thanks for the questions, Jonathan. Can we have the next caller please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\nYour question please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot.\nFirst Dave, I had one for you.\nIf I look at the third party.\nContributions, they were down a little bit, which was a little bit of a surprise.\nBut you did say that the Arizona.\nFab is on track. Can you sort of talk about that? And I know last quarter you said.\nGross CapEx would be first half weighted.\nThe offsets would be back half weighted. Is that still the case?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. So we did manage CapEx a bit better than I was hoping. We thought it would be more front end loaded. It's looking; it's going to be a lot more evenly distributed, first half versus the second half. And we managed CapEx in particular this quarter really well, which I think obviously helped on the, on the free cash flow side. You know, it's kind of a, when you manage the CapEx, you get less offsets and so, you know, that kind of drove the lower capital offsets for the quarter. But for the year we're still on track to get the same amount of capital offsets through CHIPS that we had anticipated. And that's really where most of the capital offsets have come so far.\nNow obviously, you know, as we get into, you know, CHIPS incentives that should be coming here in the not too distant future that will add to the offsets that we get. We go into next year, we start getting the investment tax credit that will help on the capital offsets. So there'll be more things that come in the future. But right now, it's largely CapEx, and it's CapEx one, and that's a function of where the spending lands quarter to quarter.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and just maybe to pile onto that a bit, obviously getting the European Chips Act approved. We're excited about that. For the Germany and Poland projects, which, you know, we'll go for formal DG Comp approval, we're also very happy. We submitted our first proposal, the on-track Arizona facility. But we'll have three more proposals going in for the US CHIPS Act this quarter. And so we're now at pace for those. So everything there is feeling exactly as we said it would, and super happy with the great engagement both in Europe as well as with the US Department of Commerce as we're working on those application processes.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a follow-up question? I do, yeah. Pat, so you talked about an accelerated.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nPipeline of more than $1 billion. I think Sandra has been recently implying that you could do over $1 billion in Gaudi next year. So the question is, is that the commitment?\nAlso at the data center.\nDay you had talked about merging the.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nGPU and the Gaudi roadmaps into Salk.\nFalcon Shores, but that's not going to.\nCome out until 2025.\nSo the question really there is wondering where that leaves customers in terms of their commitment to your roadmap, given those changes.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and let me take that and Dave can add. Overall, as we said, the accelerator pipeline is now well over $1 billion and growing rapidly about 6x this past quarter. That's led by, but not exclusively, Gaudi. That also includes the Max and Flex product lines as well. But the lion's share of that is Gaudi. Gaudi 2 is the shipping volume product today. Gaudi 3 will be the volume product for next year, and then Falcon Shores in 2025. And we're already working on Falcon Shores 2 for 2026. So we have a simplified roadmap as we bring together our GPU and our accelerators into a single offering. But the progress that we're making with Gaudi 2. It becomes more generalized with Gaudi 3.\nThe software stack, our one API approach that we're taking, will give customers confidence that they have forward compatibility into Gaudi 3 and Falcon Shores. We'll just be broadening the flexibility of that software stack. You know, we're adding FP8, we just added PyTorch 2 support. So every step along the way, it gets better. And broader use cases, more language models are being supported, more programmability is being supported in the software stack, and we're building that full right solution set as we deliver on the best of GPU and the best of matrix acceleration in the Falcon Shores timeline. But every step along the way, it just gets better. Every software release gets better, every hardware release gets better along the way to cover more of the overall accelerator marketplace. And as I said, we now have Gaudi 3 wafers, first ones are in hand.\nSo that program is looking very good. With this rapidly accelerating pipeline of opportunity, we expect that we'll be giving you very positive updates there in the future with both customers as well as expanded business opportunities.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next caller please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line. Ben Reitzes from Melius Research.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYour question please. Yeah, thanks a lot, appreciate the question. Pat, you caught my attention with your comment about PCs next year or with AI having a Centrino moment. Do you mind just talking about that? And what, when Centrino took place, you know, it was very clear we unplugged from the wires and investors really grasp that. What is the aha moment with AI that's going to accelerate the client business and benefit Intel?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and you know, I think, you know, the real question is what applications are going to become AI-enabled. Today you're starting to see that, you know, people are going to the cloud and you know, goofing around with a ChatGPT, writing a research paper and you know, that's like super cool, right? And kids are of course, you know, simplifying their homework assignments that way. But you're not going to do that for every client becoming AI-enabled. It must be done on the client for that to occur. Right. You can't go to the cloud, you can't round trip to the cloud.\nYou know, all of the new effects, real-time language translation in your Zoom calls, you know, real-time transcription, automation, inferencing, relevance, portraying generated content, and gaming environments, real-time creator environments being done through Adobe and others that are doing those as part of the client. New productivity tools, being able to do local legal brief generations on clients one after the other, right across every aspect of consumer, of developer, and enterprise efficiency use cases. We see that there's going to be a raft of AI enablement, and those will be client-centered. Those will also be at the edge. You can't round trip to the cloud. You don't have the latency, the bandwidth, or the cost structure to round trip, let's say, inferencing in a local convenience store to the cloud. It will all happen at the edge and at the client.\nSo with that in mind, we do see this idea of bringing AI directly into the client. And Meteor Lake, which we bring into the market in the second half of the year, is the first major client product that includes native AI capabilities. You know, the neural engine that we've talked about, and this will be a volume delivery that we will have, and we expect that Intel as the volume leader for the client footprint is the one that's going to truly democratize AI at the client and at the edge. And we do believe that this will become a driver of the TAM because people will say, oh, I want those. No, you, those new use cases, they make me more efficient and more capable just like Centrino made me more efficient because I didn't have to plug into the wire.\nRight now I don't have to go to the cloud to get these use cases. I'm going to have them locally on my PC in real time and cost effective. We see this as a true AI PC moment that begins with Meteor Lake in the fall of this year.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nBen, do you have a follow up question, please?\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks, John. I wanted to double click on your sequential guidance in the client business. There's been, you know, there's some concerns out there with investors that there was some demand pull in the second quarter, given some comments from some others, and just wanted to talk about your confidence for sequential growth in that business based on what you're seeing and if there was any more color there. Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, let me start on that and Dave can jump in. The biggest change quarter on quarter that we see is that we're now at healthy inventory levels, and we work through inventory Q4, Q1, and some in Q2. We now see the OEMs and the channel at healthy inventory levels. We continue to see solid demand signals for the client business from our OEMs, and even some of the end-of-quarter and early-quarter sail-through are clear indicators of good strength in that business. And obviously we combine that with gaining share again in Q2. So we come into the second half of the year with good momentum and a very strong product line. So we feel quite good about the client business outlook.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI just add, normally over the last few quarters, you've seen us identify in the 10-Q strategic sales that we've made where we've negotiated kind of attractive deals which have accelerated demand. Let's call it. When you look at our 10-Q, which will either be filed late tonight or early tomorrow, you'll see that we don't have a number in there for this quarter, which is an indication of how little we did in terms of strategic versus purchases. So to your question of did we pull in demand? I think that's probably will give you a pretty good assessment of that.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nBen, thanks for the questions. Jonathan, can we have the next caller please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly.\nOur next question comes from the.\nLine of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you. Pat. I have a question on AI as it relates to custom silicon. It's great to see that you announced a customer for 18A on custom silicon. But there's these huge demand, it seems like for custom silicon on the AI front. I think some of your hyperscale customers are already successfully using custom silicon as an AI accelerator. So I'm just curious what your strategy for that market is. Is that a focus area for you? If so, do you have any engagements with customers right now? Yeah.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, Srini. The simple answer is yes. I have multiple ways to play in this market. Obviously one of those is foundry customers. You know, we have a good pipeline of foundry customers for 18A foundry opportunities. Several of those opportunities that we're investigating are exactly what you described. You know, people looking to do their own unique versions of their AI accelerator components. We're engaging with a number of those. But some of those are going to be variations of Intel standard products. This is where the IDM 2.0 strengths really comes to play, where they could be using some of our silicon, combining it with some of their silicon designs and, with given our advanced packaging strength, that gives us another way to be participating in those areas.\nAnd, of course, that reinforces some of the near-term opportunities, which will just be packaging, right, where they already have designed with one of the other foundries. But we're going to be able to augment their capacity opportunities with immediately being able to engage with packaging opportunities, and we're seeing a pipeline of those opportunities. So overall, we agree that this is clearly going to be a market. We also see that some of the ones that you've seen most in the press are about particularly high-end training environments. But as you said, we see AI being infused in everything, and there's going to be AI chips for the edge, AI chips for the communications infrastructure, AI chips for sensing devices, for automotive devices, and we see opportunities for us both as a product provider and as a foundry and technology provider across that spectrum.\nThat's part of the unique positioning that IDM 2.0 gives us for the future.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nSrini, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nYeah, it's for Dave. Dave, it's good to see the progress on the working capital front. I think previously you said your expectation is that free cash flow would turn positive sometime in H2. Just curious if that's still the expectation. And also on the gross margin front, is there any, I guess, PRQ charges that we should be aware of as we go into Q4. Thank you.\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nOkay, so let me just take a moment just to give the team credit on the second quarter in terms of working capital because we brought inventory down by $1 billion, our days sales outstanding on the AR front is down to 24 days, which is exceptional. So a lot of what you saw in terms of the improving free cash flow from Q1 to Q2 was working capital. So I think the team's done an outstanding job just really focusing on all the elements that drive free cash flow. Our expectation is still by the end of the year to get to break-even free cash flow. There's no reason why we shouldn't achieve that. You know, obviously that the net CapEx might be a little different this year than we came, than we thought coming into the year.\nBut as we talked about, just the focus on free cash flow, the improved outlook in terms of the business, you know, we think we can, we can get to break even by, by the end of the year. As it relates to pre PRQ reserves in the fourth quarter, we're likely to have some, but it should be a pretty good quarter over quarter improvement from.\nThe Q3, which was obviously a.\nGood quarter over quarter improvement from the second quarter.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nSrini, thanks for the questions, Jonathan. I think we have time for one last caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly.\nAnd our final question for today then.\nComes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I do have a quick follow up as well. Just kind of going back to the gross margin a little bit, I think. Dave, when you guided this quarter you.\nTalked about just looking backwards, you know.\nThe PRQ impact was going to be about 250 basis points. I think there was also an under load impact that I think you guided to around 300 basis points. So I'm just curious, you know, what were those numbers in this most recent.\nQuarter, relative to kind of as we.\nTry and frame what the expectation is going forward?\n\nDavid Zinsner\n\nEVP and CFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, they were largely as expected, although, you know, it was off of a lower revenue number. So, the absolute dollars were as expected. They had a little bit of less of an impact given the revenue. The revenue was higher, and both of those numbers, like I said, will be lower in the third quarter.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nVP of Internal Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nAaron, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nI do.\nJust real quickly on just kind of the AI narrative, we talk about Gaudi a lot in the pipeline build out. I'm curious, as you look forward as part of that pipeline, Pat, do you expect to see deployment in some of the hyperscale cloud guys and competing against, you know, directly, you know, some of the large competitors on the GPU front with Gaudi in cloud?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nSimple answer, yes. Right. And you know, everyone is looking for alternatives. You know, clearly the MLPerf numbers that we posted recently with Gaudi 2, you know, show very competitive numbers, you know, significant TCO benefits for customers. They're looking for alternatives, they're also looking for more capacity. And so we're definitely engaged. You know, we already have Gaudi instances on AWS as available today already, and some of the names that we described in our earnings call, Stability AI, Genesis Cloud, you know, so some of these are the proven, I'll say at scale, tier 1 cloud providers, but some of the next generation ones are also engaging. So overall, you know, absolutely, we expect that to be the case. You know, we're also on our own dev cloud. We're making it easier for customers to, to test Gaudi more quickly.\nWe now have 1,000 customers who are taking advantage of the Intel Developer Cloud. You know, we're building a 1,000-node Gaudi cluster so that they can be at scale, you know, with their testing a very large training environment. So overall, you know, the simple answer is yes, very much so. And we're seeing a good pipeline of those opportunities. So with that, let me just wrap up our time together today. Thank you. We're grateful that you would join us today, and we're thankful that we have the opportunity to update you on our business. And simply put, it was a very good quarter.\nWe exceeded expectations on top line, on bottom line, we raised guidance, and we look forward to the continued opportunities that we have of accelerating our business and seeing the margin improvement that comes in the second half of the year. But even more important to me was the operational improvements that we saw. Good fiscal discipline, cost saving discipline, and best of all, the progress that we've made right on our execution, our process execution, product execution, the transformational journey that we're in. I just want to say a big thank you to my team for having a very good quarter that we could tell you about today. We look forward to talking to you more particularly at our Innovation in September. You know, we'll be hosting an investor Q&A track, and we hope to see many, if not all, of you there.\nIt'll be a great time. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.\nYou may now disconnect.\nGood day."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star 11 on your telephone. If you wish to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 11 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. Now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment we will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.\nOur earnings release, most recent annual report in Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid first quarter results on both the top and bottom line. Upside was driven by better than expected revenue and very disciplined expense management across our organization. The latter is not easy, and I want to thank the entire Intel team as we thoughtfully execute on cost reductions and efficiency improvements that support the investments critical to drive our strategy. Q1 results demonstrate the progress we are making to advance our transformation and the IDM 2.0 strategy.\nWe still have more work to do as we reestablish process, product, and cost leadership, but we continue to provide proof points each quarter, and we remain committed to delivering long-term value for all our shareholders consistent with prior quarters. I'd like to focus my comments on three areas: one, our view of the macro and our markets.\nTwo key highlights from Q1 and Q3: an update on our strategic priorities with a focus on our move to an internal foundry model, as the industry continues to navigate through multiple global challenges and headwinds. We remain cautious on the macro outlook even as we expect some modest recovery in the second half. We are seeing increasing stability in the PC market with inventory corrections largely proceeding as we had expected.\nHowever, the server and networking markets have yet to reach their bottoms as cloud and enterprise remain weak. As a result, our Q2 revenue guide embeds continued inventory corrections in our core markets and a range of normal seasonal to better than seasonal growth off depressed Q1 revenue levels. We remain focused on what is within our control and steadfast in our commitment to advancing our strategy.\nAs we anticipated on our Q4 earnings call, the PC market depleted a significant amount of inventory in Q1 and is tracking to be at a healthy level by the end of Q2. Importantly, the PC install base is larger, and usage remains well above pre-pandemic levels, and, along with a better than expected Q1, strengthens our view that the PC market is on track to a sell-through of 270 million units in calendar year 2023.\nAs we highlighted during our PC webinar in January, strong usage, an installed base which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels, and what we see as a conservative refresh rate supports a longer-term PC TAM of 300 million units ±. In servers, Q1 consumption TAM declined both sequentially and year over year at an accelerated rate, and we still expect to see H1 2023 TAM decline year on year with a modest recovery in H2 2023 while all segments have weakened. We'd reiterate that the correction in enterprise and rest of world, where we have stronger positions, is further along and will likely recover more quickly.\nLastly, in our broad-based markets like industrial, auto, and infrastructure, demand trends are relatively stronger, although as anticipated, NEX did see a Q1 inventory correction that we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters and likely will cause NEX revenue to decline this year. In contrast, PSG, IFS, and Mobileye continue on a strong growth trajectory, and we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year on year in calendar year 2023 much better than third-party expectations for a mid-single digits decline in the semiconductor market ex-memory.\nWhile the semiconductor industry is cyclical by nature, we continue to accelerate our transformation and position ourselves to capture the significant market growth in semis expected over the next decade, nearly doubling to more than $1 trillion by 2030.\nCombined with the need for globally balanced and resilient supply chains and a foundry market expected to be roughly $200 billion by 2030, we are well positioned to capitalize on multiple vectors of growth. On that front, let me highlight some key milestones from Q1. We are relentlessly focused on driving execution excellence across process and product roadmaps, and throughout the company, including a rigorous focus on efficiency and cost savings.\nLooking first at the progress we are making with our process roadmap, we remain on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025 relative to five nodes in four years. Notably, two out of these five nodes, Intel 7 and Intel 4, are now essentially done. Intel 7 is in high volume manufacturing. A Meteor Lake on Intel 4 is ramping production wafer starts today for a second half product launch.\nWe are quickly mastering EUV technology with Intel 4 as our first EUV node.\nAs we focus on the next three nodes, Intel 3 is on track, and we highlighted in our recent DCAI webinar. Sierra Forest will begin shipping in H1 2024 with Granite Rapids shortly thereafter, both on Intel 3. We also have significant milestones planned in Q2 for Intel 3, Intel 20A, and Intel 18A. Look forward to providing more details as we execute. Overall, we are squarely on track to deliver five nodes in four years.\nWe understand that our foundry ambitions will not be realized overnight. Building a vibrant foundry ecosystem will take time, but we also understand our foundry success is vitally important to establishing a geographically diverse and secure supply of semiconductors. We took a major step forward on building our ecosystem this month when we announced a multi-generation agreement with Arm Holdings.\nThis will enable chip designers to build leading-edge mobile SoC designs on Intel 18A, giving the design community a new foundry alternative for product innovation and a fast time to market, while also opening up new options and approaches for large ecosystem of Arm customers. We look forward to providing access to best-in-class CPUIP and the power of an open system foundry with leading-edge process technology.\nFinally, as part of my recent trip to China, we continue to work hard to complete the Tower acquisition and will update you appropriately in our webinar. Last month, we provided a substantial update on our data center and AI business, highlighting the progress and health of our roadmap. Sapphire Rapids, our 4th Gen Xeon, is one of the highest quality data\ncenter CPUs Intel has ever delivered and continues to ramp aggressively with excellent customer feedback. We are shipping over 400 designs across numerous system and memory configurations for all OEMs, ODM, and cloud providers, and we are on track to 1 million units by mid year. Notably, AI inference performance and confidential computing substantially differentiate our 4th Gen Xeon from competitors.\nSpecifically, 4th-gen Xeon offers the most comprehensive confidential computing portfolio in the industry, including virtual machine isolation with Intel Trust Domain Extensions or Intel TDX, and trust attestation services. Just this week, leading cloud service providers signaled readiness for Intel TDX instances, including Alibaba Cloud, with Microsoft announcing their preview on Azure, and Google releasing joint research conducted pre-launch to further harden TDX and complex environments.\nEmerald Rapids, our 5th-gen Xeon Scalable, is already sampling with customers and is on track to launch in Q4 2023. As stated earlier, Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3, will begin shipping in H1 2024 with Granite Rapids shortly thereafter, both of which are receiving very positive responses from sampled customers.\nSierra Forest is our first E-core server CPU, which will provide competitive performance per watt across workloads and leadership across many, with all of the benefits of the x86 ecosystem. Clearwater Forest, which is the follow-on to Sierra Forest, is coming to market in 2025 and will be manufactured on Intel 18A, the node where we intend to achieve process leadership, representing the culmination of our five nodes and four-year strategy.\nThe combination of our roadmap strengthening, as we highlighted in our webinar, and better than expected Q1 market share results and great execution on the Xeon Gen 4 ramp, Q1 was a turning point as the first quarter of an improving data center position since I became CEO.\nFurther in Q1 we taped in the Habana Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, and the Habana Gaudi 2 is in the market and offering substantial performance advantage over A100 in training and inferencing vision and language models. For example, Gaudi 2 delivers 60% higher power efficiency measured in throughput per watt for inferencing large language models such as Bloom 176 billion parameter model. Along with 4th Gen Xeon and Xeon Max, Gaudi enables us to address the accelerating growth in AI.\nRecent endorsements by Hugging Face and Stability AI are strong proof points of the validation in our AI roadmap and strategy. Our strategy is to truly democratize the incredible power of AI, championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge, and client across training and imprints in both discrete and integrated solutions.\nOur oneAPI now includes the open and royalty-free C-based programming model SYCL, which is critical to driving collaboration and innovation, as developers want the ability to write once, run anywhere. Our open source toolkit SYCLomatic is helping to accelerate the migration to SYCL as we work to democratize AI.\nWhile AI development, sparked by enthusiasm around generative AI, is today centered on LLMs in the cloud, AI deployment will rapidly migrate to inference as the dominant AI workload, and adoption will quickly expand outwards to edge and client, all areas that play to our strengths. We are focused on capitalizing across all segments with optimized silicon and software solutions.\nOur programmable solutions business continues to perform well with an all-time record revenue in Q1, and our FPGA portfolio now includes more than 15 new products scheduled to PRQ this calendar year, the highest number of new product introductions ever in our FPGA business. PSG is also piloting an initiative to build a more resilient supply chain by which customers would provide Intel with enhanced demand and new design visibility, while Intel provides customers with greater predictability of supply, leveraging the benefits of transitioning a greater percentage of PSG products to an Intel supply chain.\nOur client computing business continues to execute on this roadmap and build on recent market share wins. We gained overall PC market share in Q1 and expect our competitive position to continue to improve as we ramp Meteor Lake production in Q2 for a launch in the second half.\nIn Q1 we introduced our 13th Gen Intel Core mobile processor, followed by our new vPro platform, powered by the full lineup of 13th Gen Intel Core processors.\nIntel vPro delivers the most comprehensive security and the necessary hardware for companies in need of a PC refresh and increased productivity in 2023. Our expansive commercial portfolio will deliver more than 170 notebooks, desktops, and entry workstations from technology providers such as Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Panasonic, and Samsung Electronics. Turning to NEX and Mobileye, at Mobile World Congress we demonstrated that nearly all vRAN and virtualized network core deployments run on Intel.\nWe also introduced the range of products and solutions that enable the world's networks from the core to the radio access network and out to the intelligent edge to transition from fixed function hardware to open, programmable, software-defined platforms.\nHighlights include the launch of our 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel vRAN Boost delivering 2x the capacity gains gen over gen within the same power envelope, and up to an additional 20% power savings with integrated acceleration, and with extensive industry support from Ericsson, Verizon, Telefonica, and Vodafone, among many others. In particular, Ericsson has been working closely with us to enable the cloudification of the network, making possible industry-scale Open RAN.\nLastly, Mobileye continues to be an important part of the Intel family and delivered strong, strong growth and profitability in Q1. They continue to gain significant traction with customers for their advanced product portfolio, and we remain very confident in the long-term growth profile and value of the Mobileye business. In addition to our process and product roadmap, we continue to make progress on our commitment to reduce costs and drive efficiencies.\nWe are well on our way towards our goal of reducing $3 billion in costs in 2023 and $8 to 10 billion in annual savings exiting 2025. We further rationalize our products as we prioritize our investments in support of IDM 2.0. This includes integrating AXG into DCAI and CCG, respectively.\nIn addition, we exited our server business in Q1 and signed an agreement with MiTAC, an edge to cloud IT solutions provider and long-standing ODM partner, to manufacture and sell products based on the designs of our server systems business to create a path forward for our channel customers. I'm going to spend a few minutes on cost leadership.\nLast month I had the opportunity to meet with some of you on the East Coast, and while everyone understands that we are establishing an internal foundry model, I'm not sure we have fully explained the importance and impact of this change. Giving the manufacturing group their own P&L and the BUs a standard wafer price will drive a more efficient factory network, and a better decision on design to cost at the BU level.\nIt will also serve to create parity between internal and external foundry customers, and drive a more efficient manufacturing cost structure needed to compete and win external foundry customers with a separate P&L for the manufacturing group. We will also provide you with the cleaner comparison of the BUs to their external fabless peers.\nAs we stated on our Q3 earnings call, we believe the structure should allow us to access and execute on multiple pools of profit that are unique to an IDM, which none of our peers have. Establishing an internal foundry model is one of the most consequential steps we are taking to deliver IDM 2.0, and fundamentally shifts the way the company operates and the incentive mechanisms that drive day-to-day behaviors. We look forward to discussing this in more detail during our internal Foundry webinar in Q2. I am proud of our team's progress this quarter.\nWe remain committed to executing on our strategic roadmap by first delivering on five nodes in four years, achieving process performance parity in 2024, and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A. Second, executing on our data center and AI roadmap, including the Sapphire Rapids ramp, the launch of Emerald Rapids in H2 2023, and Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest in 2024. Third, ramping Meteor Lake in H2 2023 and launching Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake in 2024. Fourth, expanding our IFS customer base to include large design wins on Advanced Packaging, Intel 16, Intel 3, and Intel 18A.\nThis year, as we improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency, we will first return to profitability, second, execute on our internal foundry PL by 2024, and third, expand the use of our Smart Capital strategy to balance our long-term capital aspirations with near-term realities. We are steadfast in our commitment to continue to effectively allocate your capital in the pursuit of creating value for all of our stakeholders.\nBefore I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to take a moment to honor and pay tribute to the life of Gordon Moore, who passed away on 24 March 2023. Gordon defined and enabled the technology industry through his insight and vision. He was instrumental in revealing the power of transistors and inspired technologists and entrepreneurs across the decades. I am forever grateful for his guiding hand, willingness to mentor me, and his unwavering friendship.\nGordon famously said, what can be done can be outdone. This is our guiding principle as stewards of Moore's Law, which we intend to enable and drive until the periodic table is exhausted, as we use the power of technology to improve the lives of every person on Earth. Intel will hold a memorial service to honor the life and accomplishments of Gordon, and we will share more details on this shortly.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove solid business execution in the first quarter, beating guidance on both the top and bottom line against the backdrop of persistent macroeconomic volatility. We will continue to prioritize investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively manage expenses near term, and drive fundamental improvements to our cost structure long term. First quarter revenue was $11.7 billion, $700 million above the midpoint of our guide.\nResults from CCG, DCAI, IFS, and Mobileye exceeded our expectations, partially offset by softer demand in the network and edge markets impacting NEX revenue in the quarter. Gross margin was 38.4%, modestly below our guidance on higher than expected inventory reserves tied to continued macro uncertainty. Q1 margins were impacted 300 basis points by factory underload charges taken in the period.\nEPS was negative $0.04 for the quarter, $0.11 better than guide, demonstrating our cross company focus on spending discipline. Operating cash flow in Q1 was negative $1.8 billion. Net capex was $7 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $8.8 billion, and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash and investment balances of more than $27 billion and a strong investment grade profile.\nBefore moving to business unit results, I will highlight a few changes made within our segment reporting. The client and data center focused products from the former AXG business are now reported within our CCG and DCAI segments, respectively, and will have a dilutive effect on the operating margins of those businesses.\nOur silicon, photonics, and foundry automotive businesses have moved out of NEX and IFS respectively and are now reported as part of all other revenue, sharpening our focus on the significant market opportunities available to both NEX and IFS. Shifting to the first quarter business unit results, CCG achieved revenue of $5.8 billion, better than our expectations for the quarter.\nWhile we continue to see a challenging demand environment, especially in our consumer and education segments, customers continue to prefer Intel driven by our leadership product performance. As discussed last quarter, we saw significant inventory burn at our customers in the period. While inventory levels remain elevated, we anticipate the market will be closer to equilibrium as we exit. Q2 ASPs were down sequentially due to mix Q1.\nOperating profit was $520 million flat sequentially despite revenue declining 13% from Q4 and down year over year on lower revenue, higher unit costs, and excess capacity charges, partially offset by reduced OpEx. DCAI revenue was $3.7 billion, ahead of our expectations in Xeon, PSG, and AXG lines of business. We saw significant sequential and year over year TAM contraction across all CPU market segments and expect demand to remain soft in the second quarter.\nWe saw stable CPU market share in Q1 and are excited by the broad market ramp of our fourth generation Xeon Scalable processor, Sapphire Rapids. Operating loss was $518 million, impacted sequentially by lower revenue, higher product costs, and investment in leadership products on new process nodes. DCAI margins were also diluted by the merge of the AXG business and inventory reserves tied to the exit of our server system business.\nWithin our DCAI business, the Programmable Solutions group delivered record revenue for the second consecutive quarter in Q1, up 36% year over year with increased ASPs and improved external supply, which enables us to satisfy customer backlog, helping to drive continued operating profit growth. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, below our expectations for the quarter, driven by demand softness and elevated inventory levels in our network and edge markets, consistent with the overall industry.\nOperating loss was $300 million, impacted sequentially by depressed revenue in the quarter and inventory reserves, partially offset by continued expense management and discipline. Mobileye continues to outperform underlying automotive end markets, delivering record first quarter revenue of $458 million, up 16% year over year, along with a 6% year over year increase in content per vehicle. Profitability continues to be strong, with Q1 operating income of $123 million.\nIFS revenue was $118 million, including 67% sequential growth in packaging revenue. Operating loss was $140 million, impacted sequentially by increased factory startup costs. As we invest in this strategic growth business, we're well on our way towards our committed $3 billion of spending reductions in 2023 on our path to $8 to 10 billion of reductions exiting 2025, which will exclude benefits from the change in equipment useful life.\nAs demonstrated by our Q1 results, focused investment prioritization and spending discipline have our OpEx reductions trending ahead of expectation, while revenue-adjusted cost of sales reductions face headwinds from factory underload charges and inventory reserves due to continued demand uncertainty. As Pat highlighted, our shift to an internal foundry model is already demonstrating a path to the structural cost improvements necessary to achieve our long-term profit goals.\nWe've seen early wins with a reduction in disruptive factory expedites and increased focus on sort and test times. We look forward to unpacking the financial and operational benefits of our internal foundry model in much more detail in our investor webinar later in the quarter.\nNow turning to Q2 guidance, we expect second quarter revenue of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, at the midpoint of $12 billion. We expect billings to continue to trail consumption in our data center, network, and client markets as customers focus on right sizing operating inventories. While we remain cautious, we're seeing green shoots and expect sequential revenue growth throughout the year.\nPat mentioned the continued strong signals of elevated PC usage and active devices, giving us confidence that our short-term headwinds are an anomaly to long-term revenue opportunity. Demand for AI capabilities in the cloud, across the network, and at the edge continue to grow, and we're confident that our CPU and accelerator portfolios are well positioned to benefit from the market tailwind. We're forecasting Q2 gross margin of 37.5%, a tax rate of 13%, and EPS of negative $0.04 at the midpoint of revenue guidance.\nFactory underload charges are projected to impact Q2 gross margins by approximately 300 basis points, while gross margins are well below acceptable levels. I'd highlight inventory reserves on pre-PRQ products impact Q2 margins by approximately 250 basis points, which should begin to unwind later this year as new products launch. Increased sample costs in support of our Xeon product roadmap will impact margins by 40 basis points sequentially.\nOur Q2 guidance includes an approximately $500 million benefit to operating margin from the Useful Life Accounting change we announced in January, split approximately 80% to cost of sales and 20% to OpEx, up from $460 million in Q1. It's important to remember that this is a fixed cost business.\nThe impact of underloaded factories goes beyond the period charges we're seeing in the first half of the year and will be felt for several quarters as we sell through products with higher average unit costs. We'll continue to deploy factory capacity prudently as we operate within our Smart Capital framework.\nAs communicated last quarter, we expect to manage net CapEx intensity in the low 30% of revenue range in 2023, with capital offsets of approximately 20% to 30% of gross CapEx. Consistent with Smart Capital, IFS capacity represents approximately 10% of 2023 gross CapEx, a number which will scale in line with foundry customer commitments. With gross CapEx weighted to first half and capital offsets weighted to second half, we expect adjusted free cash flow to improve sequentially throughout the year and to be positive in second half of 2023.\nWhile we're encouraged by first quarter revenue and expect growth to improve sequentially through 2023, we're not satisfied with our financial results and remain focused on what we can control, our execution, and the prioritization of our owner's capital toward our long term goals.\nWe're confident that as we deliver on our roadmap commitments, we will meet and exceed our customers' expectations for our products and our owners' expectations for strong revenue growth and free cash flow generation. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now move into the Q and A portion of our call. As a reminder, we will ask each of you to ask one question, and a brief follow up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first question?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I wonder if you can go through the gross margin walk kind of through the rest of the year. There's a lot of moving parts. I know you have the underutilization of 300 basis points, and it sounds like you also have another 200 basis points you highlighted from these pre PRQ costs. You're sort of normalized at 43x those two things. There's a couple of offsets too. You got puts and takes around, you know, higher die costs from these new products like, you know, Meteor and Sapphire. Can you sort of give us a walk in terms of what the puts and takes are when you move past June? Thanks.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, sure, Tim. Let me give you a little color. On the 250 basis points that you correctly highlight that are the pre PRQ reserves, the benefit of that is as we go into the back half of the year, you know, that's related to Meteor Lake and Emerald, and so ship, you know, a lot of that reverses. In fact, in essence, we end up shipping it at 100% gross margin, so that becomes a tailwind.\nYou know, we do expect, you know, as things improve from a demand perspective, that you know, we will start to load the fab back up. The only, I guess, cautionary comment is that we, you know, still have under loaded costs that kind of are built into the cost of our product that are held in inventory.\nYou know, there does take a few quarters even beyond the time where we start to stop seeing these period costs of unutilization that we'll start to still see some cost headwinds from that. You know, ultimately we'll be loading the fabs up to the appropriate levels, and that will be a nice tailwind. Maybe the best way to describe it is, I think, you know, for the back half of the year, we feel like we'll be comfortably in the 40s from across the gross margin perspective based on all those factors. You know, obviously we're actively working on our $8 to 10 billion of spending reductions by the time we get to the end of 2025.\nA lot of that is in the cost base, you know, which will be a benefit to gross margins.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nTim, do you have a follow up?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, yeah. Pat, I guess you have a lot of products coming out in a pretty short amount of time. Basically, you've got five data center platforms in two and a half years. I understand that some are E-core and some are P-core, but usually customers want to leverage their investments in these platforms for a longer time than that. Could that be some impediment to how quickly these platforms could ramp? Can you kind of talk about that? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, it's a great question, Tim. What I'd highlight is that Sapphire and Emerald, Gen 4 and Gen 5, are the same platform. From the customer's perspective, they get to leverage those platform investments in a substantial way. Similarly, as we go into next year with Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, that's once again the same platform. Clearwater Forest the following year, that we disclosed in the data center webinar for 2025, also goes into that same platform.\nEssentially, even though it's five products that we've discussed, it's two platforms, and that ability to leverage that platform across a broader market space is very warmly received by our customers. Obviously, as we're working through this period to get back to solid leadership, you know, we're getting increasing momentum from our customers.\nAs I highlighted in my prepared remarks, you know, this is a good quarter for our data center business, a very healthy roadmap. We did better than we forecast in Q1. Market share on track for the Sapphire Rapids ramp. Overall, you know, being able to see these new use cases for AI inferencing in the platform, being able to deploy the increasing security capabilities that we disclosed.\nAll of these, you know, are very unique feature capabilities that are both differentiating, as well as value add for our customers, that helps them to see the value in the underlying platforms that we're delivering. A very good quarter. Thanks for the question, Tim.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've talked about PC, CPU inventory normalizing exiting the June quarter. Can you give us a sense of by how much you are under shipping and demand today? How do you think about the snapback? Can you talk about the timing of planned raising of utilization at least? For your CCG business?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYes. I'll start on that and Dave can jump in. You know, generally we think that we undersold into the market by about 20% in Q1 and that continues in Q2. Overall, we said a 270 million unit sell-through TAM for the year that is essentially equivalent to the 240 or 250 million unit sell-in TAM that you might have seen from some of the industry analysts.\nOverall, we think first half, we end the first half with a very healthy inventory position by our OEMs and by the channel, you know, that positions us very well for natural improvement in a stronger second half as we're now selling, I'll say, in at the same rate of selling out in the marketplace in a normally stronger back half of the year.\nOverall, this is just going to be a positive every quarter as we go through the year. You know, we're seeing strong, strong momentum from our customers for our roadmap. As Dave indicated, you know, we're already starting to build inventory for the Meteor Lake launch later in the year, which is another strong indication. Dave, if you want to comment on the inventory. Comment.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, we have about 155 days of inventory in the aggregate on the balance sheet. Obviously, as we get through the inventory depletion at customers and we start to normalize back up to the level of income consumption, we'll start to burn through that inventory and, you know, you can expect us to start ramping the factories. I don't think we'll be fully ramped by the end of the year, but we certainly will be improving the ramp through the year.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nC.J., do you have a follow-up question?\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, a quick one. Pat, in your prepared remarks you talked about positive feedback from test chips at your customers for Sierra and Granite, curious if you can share any of that feedback that you're hearing to give us confidence on that ramp.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and I'd say generally the feedback is wow, right? You guys are delivering at the front end of your schedule windows that you gave us with a very high quality product, and they're now into their what we call the volume validation phase of their platforms, so where they're receiving enough samples that they can start to do broad validation of the platform.\nThat validation cycle is very critical for us because it informs us of when we're ready to move forward with the production steppings of those parts in both the software and the firmware of the platform. We're seeing very good response on both the first E-core part with Sierra Forest as well as the next generation P-core part with Granite Rapids.\nSo overall, I just say we feel super good that we're getting such a warm response from customers, and this positions us very well as they're rebuilding their confidence in Intel, and this, you know, you've heard me talk before, C.J., that we have to rebuild our customers' confidence, and the performance that we're seeing not just on Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids, Gen 5, but next year's products and the very strong position for the E-core products going into 2025 with Clearwater Forest has been a strong uptick in their belief that Intel's execution machine is back for their data center products of the future.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, C.J. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Pat, in your preamble you talked a little bit about some data center trends by the end markets. A little bit geographically, a little bit customer type with enterprise. I was hoping you could dig a little bit deeper into what you're seeing in the cloud side of things. The customers themselves seem to be reporting very strong numbers, but it seemed that you alluded to that still being an inventory digesting end market for you and then how Intel specifically in cloud is doing competitively.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you. You know, clearly there was a down quarter for enterprise and for cloud. We do see that affecting the first, at least the first half of the year. That said, you know, we're encouraged by some of the comments that you've heard and that you refer to for the overall market. You know, we do see that our position is improving.\nAs I indicated in Q1, we saw better than forecast market segment share. You know, we also saw some green shoots for the first time in China, and we're encouraged by that market starting to show some positive characteristics. You know, we'd also say that some of that strength in data center is driven by AI, and we're seeing a very positive response to Gaudi 2 and seeing our pipeline growing very rapidly for that product line.\nWe also saw that as a driver of the early strong ramp for Gen 4 Sapphire Rapids. You know, those taken together, you know, we're, you know, we do believe that's an important trend. But we also, as you said in my prepared remarks, you know, we see that we need to make AI, and that is a critical use case, broadly available, and that's what we refer to as democratizing AI, where those super high end machines are uneconomical for most environments, and we have to enable the broad deployment of inferencing, being able to use AI.\nAnd that's an area where particularly our core Xeon product line has particular strengths, you know, well above prior generations and compared to competitive alternatives, and one that we expect to be an area of strength for us long term.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nRoss, do you have a follow up?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nI do. I just wanted to go back and revisit the gross margin side. So, one for Dave, the underutilization charges: is there some trigger point at which, revenue-wise, I guess we should expect that to go away because obviously that's the 300 basis point headwind, Q2, Q4 in a row of that. Then the pre-PRQ side of things, given the frequency of new product introductions that was alluded to in a prior question, it doesn't seem like those would necessarily go away that fast, or if they do, for a quarter or two, they would come back.\nSo, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes on those underutilization charges and pre PRQs, please?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, okay. So on the pre PRQ, you're right, you know, and it always is lumpy. We saw this effect, you know, midway through last year with Sapphire Rapids. And so, you know, we will have these on occasion, but we think for the second half of the year for sure, you know, we won't see this. This magnitude of reserves is a pretty significant quarter for us in the second quarter on the underloading charges, you know.\nI think it's more partially it's about revenue, but partially it's about your inventory levels and where they are. So we obviously need to bring the inventory levels down from 155 days. That's going to be important. I think I would just say that, hey, in the third and fourth quarter I would see, I would expect to see an improving situation in terms of under loads and likely, you know, that will be behind us by the time we're through the end of the year.\nJust on the period costs underutilization charges, we might be living with some higher cost per unit for a couple quarters after that, you know, because of underutilization that we built into the cost of the products.But you know, ultimately we'll have this factory or the factory network loaded back up.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question please.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Cowen\n\nYes, thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Pat, I wanted, the first question I wanted to ask is on sort of the node roadmap. You guys have made some good progress there, and we're working through some end-market and near-term product dynamics. But focusing on the five nodes in four years. I know there's some internal nodes that are being developed as well around backside power via and also gate all around.\nMaybe you could give a little bit of an update as to how those roadmaps are going on those two pieces of technology individually. I guess the second part of the question, if you do succeed in getting to node parity and then node leadership as you described, can you talk about a path to cost parity for internal and external potential customers on 18A? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, yeah, great question, Matt. And you know, as I indicated, you know, the five nodes in four years, Intel 7 done, Intel 4 with the Meteor Lake volume ramp, we view that as all but done, right. You know, we are, you know, essentially the process is PRQ'd, and now we're ramping the process product, which will PRQ later in the year. So we feel like we're two of five are now completed.\nObviously, the next one up is Intel 3, and with Intel 3, you know, the positive updates that we've given on Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest for next year, you know, the volume sampling that I've already referred to gives us a lot of confidence that that is now coming along very nicely.\nBoth Intel 4 and Intel 3 are EUV nodes as you say. As we go to 20A and 18A, the two major innovations are the RibbonFET, the Gate-All-Around transistor architecture, and the Backside Power. Given the uniqueness of the Backside Power, as you indicate, we had an internal node that we didn't expose to products or externally to de-risk that node, and that went extremely well.\nWe had very good results from the Backside Power, the power delivery, the routability improvements that that gave, and as I'm, you know, as one proof point of that, you know, the ARM announcement, you know, was one that demonstrated significant benefits of Backside Power that we were able to do. So 20A and 18A are the next ones up.\n20A will be primarily a client node as we ramp our Arrow Lake products in 2024 and 2025. 18A will be everything. We will have server products, client products, networking products, and many foundry products. We also noted that this was the quarter that we have our first foundry test chips coming out. So some of the test chips for external customers on 18A are now popping up out of fab and being tested by them. So good affirmation from them.\nYou know, you also mentioned. I think it's actually a very insightful question, Matt. You know, the cost structure and one of the things that we've put a lot of emphasis on with 18 is getting to structural cost parity with what we believe is the best in the industry at that point.\nSo we view this as not just getting to power and performance, but parity, but also area parity and cost structural parity as we get to 18A. And we believe as we've benchmarked ourselves against industry best, you know, we believe we're on track to do that in the 18A time frame. And that's part of why we talk about in the internal foundry model, you know, is being able to start really measuring the P and L. Right. And really viewing it as the industry price for wafers is understood. And we have to benchmark ourselves against that and deliver margin structure at the wafer level that's competitive with that.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nMatt, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Cowen\n\nYeah, I do, John, and thank you, Pat, for all the detail there. My second question is on server roadmap, and you guys had a helpful DCII roadmap day a month or so ago. I guess my question kind of relates to another question that was asked on platform compatibility. I think Pat, you mentioned a few products on the roadmap, including up until, including Clearwater Forest being on the same sort of platform as Granite.\nThere was another product that was on the public roadmap before Diamond Rapids for the next sort of P-core product. Any update there? I just want to. It wasn't really mentioned at DCII day, and I've had a few folks asking me about it, and is it on the same platform? Thanks.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. You know, while we're not, you know, speaking a lot about that next generation product, that would be the introduction of the next generation platform at that point. You know, that would be when we move to the next platform, you know, which will change package architecture, power delivery architecture, memory channel, you know, key steps in, you know, memory scalability with our CXL technology.\nSo that will be a big step in terms of the platform architecture at that point. I'll just say every aspect of our roadmap is getting well received by our customers for both enterprise, but also, and critically, for cloud customers as well.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Matt. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nCertainly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Your question, please.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nHey, sorry, the line. Is that for me? Pierre?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYes, Pierre, how are you?\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nYes, sorry, apologies. Very unlucky. The line kept right when you said my name. Thanks a lot for all the details on the gross margin and taking a step back, I'm kind of thinking between now and the end of 2025, your gross margin is going to be very volatile and very difficult to read because you have a lot on your plate, a lot of cost coming in and out with all the various nodes.\nSo my question would be maybe looking at things from a much higher level. Let's say we are around about 20 points below, you know, the historic margin, being in a good competitive position. Some of that is clearly a scale issue. The business has shrunk a lot recently. And then some of that is really this very difficult 10 nanometer node where the cost per unit is significantly too high.\nAnd so, my question really is, from what you know already, from the nodes that you have coming up like that is now very, very tangible. Intel 4, you know, how much of this gap are you going to regain with this node? Really looking at it on the wafer against wafer without making that any sort of guide of what do you get in 2020, 2023, 2024, or 2025, like forgetting about the roadmap, looking at it, wafer against wafer, you know, what order of magnitude of improvement in pricing barrier do you think you get? Earnings power just because you now have a competitive cost base in your manufacturing.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. So take some of it, and then you.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nMaybe like at a high level, Pierre, maybe the way to think about it is, look, you know, the one element of getting to, you know, the appropriate cost structure to deliver the margins is getting our process technology to be competitive. And you know, that's really at 18A where we intersect that. So, you know, we make improvements along the way, but that's really where we make the meaningful improvement to get there from a process perspective.\nNow, the challenge is all along the way there's, you know, this kind of startup cost that we have to deal with, which is hundreds of basis points of headwind for us that we have by virtue of the fact that we're stacked on stacked, you know, we were the five nodes in four years.\nThat Pat is driving is the right strategy, but it does, you know, create headwinds on the cost side. So, so that, you know, we've got to work our way through that. But once we're on the other side of five nodes in four years, we have a competitive process technology from a cost perspective. We've gotten ourselves, you know, this, this, you know, let's say significantly higher startup cost that we are incurring behind us as well.\nAnd then as you point out, you know, you have the benefits of the scale of revenue that we would expect. And then lastly you have, you know, as Pat was talking about, this whole notion of the internal foundry model which just drives a lot of attention on cost and where we think we're going to get a lot of that $8 to 10 billion of savings exiting 2025.\nSo I think, you know, the way I look at it at least is that, you know, we put forth a model for gross margins, we changed the depreciation which incrementally raises that target, and there's nothing that's going on at the company that would suggest that we're off pace from that. We think we are going to achieve that. You know, the timing is obviously a function somewhat of the market, but other than that, you know, we feel like we on a great path to have those margins.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah, and I would just say, you know, there will be lumpiness, Pierre. Right. You know, of the ups and downs along the way when your process nodes come online, as you work through different product cycles, et cetera. But we'd say, you know, as Dave said, you know, we're going from the 30s into the 40s comfortably this year.\nYou know, we set a long term model into the 50s that if you consider the useful life, gets us up around 60 by the end of the five year period as we've talked about. So you know, we're on track to, I'll say, you know, margins should be up and to the right as we work over time with lumpiness up and down due to these various considerations. But that's the path that we're laying ourselves upon.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nPierre, do you have a quick follow up question?\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nYes, very quick one. Pat, you mentioned Gaudi and like very, very positive benchmark on large language models. When I look around me, I don't see like good tangible signs of Gaudi, like really gaining traction and getting big, despite the fact that like the web today is like really starving for more processing power and more capacity to run these models.\nSo my question was, am I just not seeing something that will become apparent very, very soon or are there still like you know, building blocks and path and things that Gaudi is missing before really taking this very, very fast growing opportunity.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I think it's a fair commentary that, you know, we're only starting to see good, positive proof points in the industry. So I think that's a fair critique, Pierre, you know. But I point back to, you know, the announcements, Hugging Face, you know, which is the most popular, sort of like the GitHub of the AI world. Very positive proof point this quarter, stable diffusion, right.\nAnother instability AI, important forces. Also, my comments around a rapidly growing pipeline, obviously you can't measure that, but I'll tell you, we have many opportunities that we're now engaging in globally. You'll also see us taking more aggressive steps with our DevCloud, you know, presenting this as a developer environment for the market. So I think we have a lot of work to do here to show up in a meaningful way. But we think the Gaudi 2 strategy is now starting to gain quite a lot of interest in the market.\nAs I said in my prepared remarks, Gaudi 3 has now taped out, which would be the next step up. You know, also we're describing to customers our 2025 platform, the Falcon Shores product, which is another step up, you know, that also brings together the full offering of our HPC and AI into a single platform offering. Customers are responding very well to the, you know, I'll say the alignment and simplification of our roadmap and HPC and AI coming together.\nSo overall, we feel like we're now starting to show up in this space, but we have a lot of work to do to land meaningful revenue customers in this area. And I'm hopeful that we'll be able to put some clear proof points that you can start to see in the marketplace in the near future.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Pierre. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.Your question please.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I had a near term and then a longer term one. So on the near term, how should we think about the second half? You know, right now, when I look at consensus expectations, they are set for about 15% to 20% half on half growth. I appreciate you're not giving guidance, but is that the kind of growth that is contemplated or reflected in the return to the low 40s gross margin?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, I think what Pat said is, you know, we thought things would be modestly better in the second half of the year. And that, combined with the fact that pre-PRQ reserves reverse themselves, we'll probably see some better utilization levels. You know, that's what gives us the confidence of comfortably in the 40s. You know, we're not providing any specific revenue guidance on the second half.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nI'd say, you know, there's three things to just think about for the second half. You know, one is that you normally have a stronger second half in our industry. We expect that to be the case. You know, second is we'll have worked through a lot of the inventory issues as you go first half to second half. And we are seeing some green shoots in the marketplace. You know, we think it's a tough market for all, right. And we're navigating through it well as seen by our top and bottom line beat in Q1, you know, but hey, it's a tough market out there. So we're still being fairly cautious as we look out over time.\nThen third, obviously our strengthening execution, our roadmap is getting stronger, we're gaining market share, and I think of our Q1 as a solid proof point that we're navigating through the tough environment that we have in a better way than most. So we are incrementally more positive on the second half. But we also believe we have to continue careful execution, careful fiscal discipline as we go through a very uncertain macro outlook.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nVivek, do you have a follow up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, thank you, John. So my longer term question is how do you see the role of Arm in the server CPU market? You know, it's interesting you're starting to partner with Ampere on Arm servers. I presume that implies a more credible ecosystem developing for Arm servers. I believe it's already around, you know, mid single digit or so as part of cloud instances. So how do you see the role of Arm servers over the next few years and do you see it as. And just what is the impact on x86 server CPU TAM if Arm becomes bigger in the market?\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, and you know, a couple of things here, Vivek. You know, one is, you know, the announcement that we did with ARM this quarter around IFS, you know, was a strong ecosystem statement, you know, for our foundry offerings and one, you know, that was focused around the mobile platform.\nBut we do expect that we'll have a broader play over time as the announcement indicated that it's first focused on mobile where ARM has proven considerable strength across the market. I'd also say that we think of the market in the future of four architectures matter, ARM, RISC-V, x86 playing a critical role, and the role of accelerators and GPU. Right. And we'll be participating across all of those, whether that's through foundry or through our product offerings.\nYou know, I've continued to view that if we are doing a great job with our roadmap, that the role of ARM in the data center will be limited. Right. And particularly with the E-core product line that we've laid now, laid out with Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest, and strong, you know, products coming thereafter, we believe that we now deliver power, performance, TCO benefit at x86.\nMigrating software stacks in the data center is a lot of work. And if I give customers an easy path with x86 and E-core solutions with superior TCO alternatives, that will do very well. So with that, that's our primary play. At the same time, our foundry play will become open to all. You know, we will manufacture, right.\nAny of the RISC-V, ARM, x86, and GPU alternatives for the industry through our superior capabilities and our foundry offerings over time. We view this as an industry play of great significance and one that we're committed to competing for leadership wafers across every architecture, every segment of the industry.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Vivek. Jonathan, we have time for one last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the CapEx you mentioned, 10% going to foundry. Can you talk about? I still get kind of a gross CapEx number that's north of $20 billion. Does that seem like it's in the ballpark? And are you spending that money more on shells and capacity or how much of that money gets allocated to you know, the five nodes in four years?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah, gross would be north of $20 billion. You know, we think, as I mentioned, that we can keep net CapEx intensity in kind of the low 30s% of revenue, which is, you know, kind of within our model, actually a little bit better than what we modeled during the capital intensive phase of our transformation. You know, as it relates to kind of the split, we are probably certainly there's a lot of CapEx going to equipment, there's a lot of CapEx going to, you know, shells. We're probably a little bit more.\nYou know, biased towards shell investment right now. You know, we had been in the past behind and, you know, that caught us and you know, these are obviously the very long lead time type investments. So you want to make sure you have a shell when you need it. So we have biased ourselves to do that. And to make the investments that are appropriate in that regard.\nAnd as you point out, as I said, you know, it's largely around our own needs. We are making some modest investments on the foundry side right now as we start to gain traction on the customer front and as we get more customers, you know, we'll ramp that investment as appropriate.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nCVP of Investor Relations, Intel Corporation\n\nJoe, do you have a quick follow up?\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI do, yeah. Thank you for that. In terms of the sort of capital offsets that you've got in at 20 to 30%, you know, is there, is there the opportunity for that number to be better? For example, with the CHIPS Act as the grant money starts to get dispersed, or you've talked about additional yield deals like Brookfield, like, I guess, are you contemplating within that number potential future improvement, or does that number get better if we start to see benefit from those things?\n\nDave Zinsner\n\nCFO, Intel Corporation\n\nI mean, this is our current outlook is somewhere in the 20% to 30%. It obviously can get better. It assumes that we will have another skip by the end of the year and some, you know, government incentives. But obviously I've got the CEO out there, you know, managing the offsets and, you know, so I think there's certainly opportunity to see upside, if not this year, next year. And keep in mind next year we'll also have the benefit of the Investment Tax Credit coming in at that point, which will obviously be helpful.\n\nPat Gelsinger\n\nCEO, Intel Corporation\n\nYeah. I would just add on top of that that, you know, this is something we're working, you know, we're engaging right now with the Department of Commerce and working through our grant applications in that area. You know, we have modeled a certain level in the guidelines that Dave said. Obviously we're going to be working to do better than that in this regard. And, you know, fundamentally, the CHIPS Act is all about, you know, making US manufacturing competitive in the world.\nAnd that's the focus that we have and the intent of Congress, as was laid out, and we hope to get those done as quickly as possible. We also had a major milestone with the EU CHIPS Act passing Parliament last week. And we continue to work on that front and obviously seek an investment tax credit.\nYou know, we're working to make our capital intensity and efficiency, you know, to be a great opportunity for us to bring shareholder returns in a meaningful way. So with that, let me just wrap up our time together. You know, first let me say thank you. You know, we're grateful that you'd join us. You know, we're grateful that we have the opportunity to give you an update on our business and the progress that we're making.\nWhile the macro is challenging and plenty of headwinds out there, we also believe that our execution on our financials, a beat on top and bottom line, great execution on our process and product roadmaps. And here we are two years into my tenure, and the journey to date has had some unexpected bumps in the road.\nWe are also beginning to see clear points that increase my confidence that we have the right strategy, the right team, and we are executing on this transformation. And we look forward to updating you throughout the quarter and our next call together. So thank you all so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nThank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such, it does involve risks and uncertainties. Our press release provides more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe've also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter, and we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings release and earnings presentation include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.\nWith that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPatrick P. Gelsinger\n\nCEO & Director, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 revenue came in at the low end of guide and was impacted by persistent macro headwinds, which began in Q2 and underscored a 2022 characterized by unprecedented volatility, which will continue in the near term.\nWe made meaningful progress on several fronts in calendar year '22, notwithstanding all the challenges, but we readily admit our results and our Q1 guidance are below what we expected ourselves. We are working diligently to address the challenges brought on by current demand trends and remain confident in our long-term plans and trajectory.\nAccordingly, we are even more aggressively executing on the cost measures we described in Q3 even as we keep the investments critical to our long-term transformation intact with a clear eye of making the right capital allocation decision to drive the most long-term value.\nToday, I'd like to address 3 areas. One, our view on the macro and the markets in which we participate; two, the operational progress we made in 2022; three, as we enter the new year outlining the commitments we are making to all our stakeholders.\nFirst, on the macro. We expect macro weakness to persist at least through the first half of the year with the possibility of second half improvements. However, given the uncertainty in the current environment, we are not going to provide revenue guidance beyond Q1. Dave will provide guidelines for capital spending, depreciation and adjusted free cash flow in his prepared comments.\nHaving said that, let me give you additional color regarding our view of our markets in 2023. To various degrees, all our markets are being impacted by macro uncertainty, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions in Europe and COVID impacts in Asia, especially in China.\nIn the PC market, we saw a further deterioration as we ended calendar year '22. In Q3, we provided an estimate for the calendar year '23 PC consumption TAM of 270 million to 295 million units. Given continued uncertainty and demand signals we see in Q1, we expect the lower end of that range is a more likely outcome. Near term, the PC ecosystem continues to deplete inventory.\nFor all of calendar year '22, our sell-in was roughly 10% below consumption with Q4 under-shipping meaningfully higher than full year, and Q1 expected to grow again to represent the most significant inventory digestion in our data set. While we know this dynamic will need to reverse, predicting one is difficult.\nImportantly, PC usage data remains strong, reinforcing that use cases brought on by COVID are persistent even as the economy has reopened. And as we highlighted in our recent PC webinar, strong usage and installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels and what we see as a conservative refresh rate, supports a longer-term PC TAM of 300 million units plus or minus, post this period of adjustment.\nWe intend to capitalize on this TAM through a strong pipeline of innovation and based on the growing strength of our product portfolio, customers are increasingly betting on Intel. We grew share in the second half of '22, and we expect that positive momentum to continue in '23.\nWe remain clear eyed on managing to near-term weakness in PCs but we also see the enduring and increasing value PCs have in our daily lives.\nIn the server market, the overall consumption TAM grew modestly in calendar year '22, albeit at diminishing rates as the year progressed. Inventory burn drove server CPU shipments down mid-single digits year-on-year in calendar year '22 with hyperscale up, offset by declines in enterprise and Rest of World.\nOur share in calendar year '22 was in line with our subdued expectations, and our revenue volatility was a function of TAM, especially given our outsized exposure to enterprise and China. We expect Q1 server consumption TAM to decline both sequentially and year-over-year at an accelerated rate with first half '23 server consumption TAM down year-on-year before returning to growth in the second half.\nWhile all segments have weakened, enterprise and rest of world, especially China, continues to be weaker than hyperscale. However, we'd highlight that the correction in enterprise and rest of the world, where we have stronger positions, are further along than hyperscale.\nLastly, in our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure, demand trends throughout calendar year '22 were strong but not completely immune to the macro volatility. Strong demand in these markets was mirrored by strong Q4 and record calendar year '22 revenue in NEX, PSG, IFS and Mobileye. We see calendar year '23 as another growth year for us in these areas even though the absolute rate is difficult to predict today.\nThis is in contrast to the semi market ex-memory, which third parties expect to decline low to mid-single digits. We entered 2023 with a view that much of the macro uncertainty of the last year is likely to persist, especially in the first half of the year. As such, we are laser-focused on executing to our $3 billion in calendar year '23 cost savings that we committed on our Q3 earnings call.\nWe are making tough decisions to right-size the organization and we further sharpened our business focus within our BUs by rationalizing product road maps and investments.\nNEX continues to do well and is a core part of our strategic transformation, but we will end future investments in our network switching product line, while still fully supporting existing products and customers. Since my return, we have exited 7 businesses, providing in excess of $1.5 billion in savings.\nWe are also well underway to integrating AXG into CCG and DCAI, respectively, to drive a more effective go-to-market capability, accelerating the scale of these businesses while further reducing costs. While it was important to focus on what we are doing to address the current macro uncertainty, it is also important to highlight that despite disappointing financial results, calendar year '22 did see considerable progress towards our transformation. We remain fully committed to executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. Success starts with our people and execution follows culture.\nIn calendar year '22, we took important strides to rebuild the leadership team, promoting from within and adding fresh perspectives from the outside. This includes the Board of Directors with the addition of Lip-Bu Tan and Barbara Novick, both of whom have already made significant contributions and the appointment of Frank Yeary as Chair.\nIn addition, a year ago, we reestablished OKRs to drive accountability and transparency across the organization, and we reintroduced Tick-Tock 2 to establish a rigorous methodology of design and product development. Both are key spark plugs to our execution engine.\nRebuilding the culture has begun to show benefits in manufacturing and design. Our progress against our TD road map continue to improve throughout calendar year '22, and every quarter, our confidence grows. We are at/or ahead of our goal of 5 nodes in 4 years. Intel 7 is now in high-volume manufacturing for both client and server. On Intel 4, we are ready today for manufacturing, and we look forward to the Meteor Lake ramp in second half of the year.\nIntel 3 continues to show great health and is on track. Intel 4 and 3 are our first modes deploying EUV, and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density.\nOn Intel 20A and Intel 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFETs and PowerVia, internal test chips and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with the silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025.\nProgress in TD continues to be validated by our IFS pipeline. I am happy that we were able to add a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider as a leading edge customer for Intel 3. Including prior customers, such as MediaTek, we now have lifetime deal value of greater than $4 billion for IFS.\nWe also have an active pipeline engagements with 7 out of the 10 largest foundry customers coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 43 potential customers and ecosystem partner test chips. Additionally, we continue to make progress on Intel18A, and I've already shared the engineering release of PDK 0.5 with our lead customers and expect to have the final production release in the next few weeks.\nIn addition, we are working hard to complete the Tower acquisition, which will further amplify our momentum as our foundry business becomes even more compelling to customers.\nOn the product front, the PRQ of Sapphire Rapids in Q3 and the formal introduction of our fourth gen Xeon scalable CPU and Xeon CPU MAX series better known to many of you as U.S. Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, respectively, on January 10 was a great milestone. It was particularly satisfying to host a customer-centered events, including testimonials from Dell, Google Cloud, HPE, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA, among many others.\nWe are thrilled to be ramping production to meet a strong backlog of demand, and we are on track to ship 1 million units by midyear. In addition, as part of AXG moves into DCAI, it is noteworthy that our Intel Flex series, optimized for and showing clear leadership in media stream density and visual quality, is now shifting initial deployments with large CSPs and MNCs, enabling large-scale cloud gaming and media delivery deployments.\nOur DCAI road map only improves from here and will ramp into sampling and has completed power on with top OEM and CSP customers, and it remains on track to launch in the second half of 2023. Granite Rapids, our next performance core addition to the Xeon portfolio, is on track to launch in 2024, running multiple operating systems across many different configurations.\nFurther, our first efficient core product, CR4, is also on track for 2024. Lastly, it is appropriate to continue to highlight PSG for its standout performance delivering record Q4 revenue up 42% year-on-year. We are planning to have a more fulsome look at our progress in DCAI at our next investor webinar later in Q1. Stay tuned for the invitation.\nIn CCG, we continue to build on our market share momentum across the PC stack by focusing on delivering leadership products with our broad, open ecosystem. I'm particularly pleased that our clear performance leadership at the high end drove record client ASPs in the quarter. In Q4, the 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family, codename, Raptor Lake, became available, starting with the desktop K processors and the Intel Z 790 chipset.\nIn partnership with ASUS, we officially set a new world record for overclocking, pushing the 13th Gen Intel Core past the 9 gigahertz barrier for the first time ever. Hands down, we provide desktop enthusiasts and gamers with the best processors and features for overclocking in the PC industry.\nWe also introduced our notebook Raptor Lake family at CES, including the world's fastest notebook CPU and the first 24 cores. We look forward to ramping the more than 300 mobile design wins we have already secured in the first half of '23.\nMeteor Lake, our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4, remains on track for the second half of the year. And with Meteor Lake progressing well, it's now appropriate to look forward to Lunar Lake, which is on track for production readiness in 2024, having taped out its first silicon. Lunar Lake is optimized for ultra-low power performance, which will enable more of our PC partners to create ultrathin and light systems for mobile users. In addition, as we outlined on our webinar, we are excited by the strength of the Evo brand. The introduction of Unison for leadership multi-device experience as we ramp the more than 60 design wins and the uniqueness of vPro in the enterprise market, helping our customers drive an almost 200% return on investment by deploying vPro platforms to their end users.\nLastly, as consumer graphics reintegrate into CCG, enthusiasm for our latest Alchemist-based discrete graphics products continue to build and we expect volume ramp throughout the year.\nTurning to NEX and Mobileye. Both businesses have performed well in Q4 and calendar year '22, partially insulated by some of the market forces impacting PCs and server, any exit key product milestones with Mount Evans, Raptor Lake P&S, and Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids to drive a second consecutive year of double-digit year-on-year growth in calendar year '22. We expect market share gains and outperformance to continue in '23.\nMobileye increased revenue by almost 60% year-on-year in Q4 and is on a solid growth path for calendar year '23. Calendar year '22 design wins, including SuperVision, are projected to generate future revenue of approximately $6.7 billion across 64 million units.\nIn addition, our manufacturing organization performed well throughout calendar year '22. Starting the year navigating the worst supply-constrained environment in over 20 years, only to have to pivot in Q2 to respond to rapidly changing demand signals, which are now driving near-term underloading in our factory network. More importantly, we continue to push forward with the next phase of IDM 2.0, creating an internal foundry evolving our systems business practices and culture to establish a leadership cost structure. This new approach is already gaining momentum internally.\nAs a reminder, the internal foundry model will place our BUs in a similar economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have identified 9 different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue.\nIn addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance.\nWe'll also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L in calendar year '24. Ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are allocating your capital and creating value.\nWe expect additional efficiencies as we implement our internal foundry model, which is a key element to accomplish our $8 billion to $10 billion of cost savings exiting 2025, as we outlined on our last call.\nI want to remind everyone that we are on a multiyear journey. We remain focused on the things that are within our control as we navigate short-term headwinds while executing to our long-term strategy. While I remain sober that we have a long way to achieve our financial expectations, I am pleased with the transformation progress that we are making.\nI can tell you, in addition to obviously focusing on the day-to-day running of the company, we continue to examine numerous additional value-creating initiatives for 2023 as we always do. We will update you as we move along on any we deem appropriate.\nRest assured, we remain committed to creating value for our owners and to delivering the long-term strategic road map we laid out at the beginning of this journey, and we are confident in our ability to do so. We will: one, deliver on 5 nodes in 4 years, achieving process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A; two, execute on an aggressive Sapphire Rapids ramp, introduced Emerald Rapids in second half '23 and Granite Rapids and CR4s in 2024; three, ramp Meteor Lake in second half '23 and PRQ Lunar Lake in 2024; and four, expand our IFS customer base to include large design wins on Intel 16, Intel 3 and 18A this year.\nWe also need to improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency. On this front, we will: one, return to profitability and deliver the benefits of our calendar year '23, '24 and '25 efforts to reduce costs and drive efficiencies; two, execute on our internal foundry P&L by 2024; and three, expand on the use of our smart capital strategy to leverage multiple pools of capital, including SCIPs and chips in the U.S. and Europe to balance our long-term capacity aspirations with near-term realities.\nBefore I turn it over to Dave, I'm going to close by saying we take our commitments to all our stakeholders extremely seriously and, ultimately, we strive to create value for each of them. For our customers, it is rebuilding our execution engine to provide a predictable cadence of best-in-class products to support their ambitions.\nFor our employees, it is to provide them with the opportunity to develop and bring to market world-changing technologies. It is what inspires each of us inside of the company.\nFor our external owners, it is to make thoughtful, deliberate decisions around capital allocation, which drives the highest return on investment we make with your capital. Our ambitions are equaled by our passion, and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IBM 2.0.\n\nDavid A. Zinsner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We saw solid business execution in the fourth quarter despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. As Pat indicated, we expect challenging macro conditions to continue through at least the first half of the year.\nAs outlined last quarter, we'll continue to prioritize investments critical to our transformation, prudently and aggressively managed expenses near term and drive fundamental improvements in our cost structure longer term. We're executing well towards our $3 billion target in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting '25.\nFourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, landing at the low end of our range and down 8% sequentially. Revenue from DCAI and NEX were in line with expectations, while CCG was impacted by softening demand for PCs. Gross margin for the quarter was 44%, slightly better than we had expected for the low end of our revenue range.\nQ4 gross margins were impacted 220 basis points from factory underload charges offsetting a sequential 170 basis point benefit from an insurance settlement. EPS for the quarter was $0.10. $0.10 below our guide on lower revenue and increased inventory reserves.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $7.7 billion. Net CapEx was $4.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of $3.1 billion and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. We finished FY '22 with revenue of $63.1 billion, gross margin of 47.3% and EPS of $1.84. We generated $15.4 billion of cash from operations and an adjusted free cash flow of approximately negative $4 billion at the low end of the range we provided last quarter, despite approximately $3 billion of capital incentives that shifted from Q4 into 2023.\nWhen we spoke at Investor Day last February, we forecasted revenue of $76 billion and adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to $2 billion for FY '22. As macroeconomic conditions deteriorated at a rapid pace in second half of '22, we committed to optimizing the areas of the business within our control.\nThrough reductions in spending and significant working capital improvements, we offset a $13 billion reduction to revenue expectations to come within $2 billion of our initial adjusted free cash flow guide, while still making the needed capital investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy, and to position ourselves for long-term growth in a market expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $28 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade profile.\nMoving to fourth quarter business unit results. CCG revenue was $6.6 billion, a decline of 36% year-over-year as PC TAM deteriorated faster than expected due to macroeconomic headwinds. Customer inventory remains elevated beyond our previous expectations and will continue to burn into the first half of '23.\nCCG realized record CPU ASPs, up 11% year-over-year as we continue to see relative strength in our premium segments driven by leadership performance and attractive features of our Evo and vPro platforms. Q4 operating profit was $0.7 billion, down year-over-year on lower revenue and increased Intel 7 product mix.\nDCAI revenue was $4.3 billion in Q4, up 2% sequentially with higher ASPs offsetting demand softness and down 33% year-over-year driven by TAM contraction and competitive pressure. DCAI operating profit for the fourth quarter was $371 million.\nWhile still unsatisfactory, profit was up more than $350 million sequentially on reduced factory costs. Operating profit was down substantially year-over-year, impacted by lower revenue, increased advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs.\nWithin DCAI, PSG achieved record Q4 revenue, up 42% year-over-year, along with record full year revenue, up 29% year-over-year through increased ASPs, improved external supply and strength in the infrastructure segment. PSG enters 2023 with still significant unfulfilled backlog.\nNEX quarterly revenue was $2.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year as declining global GDP impacted the Edge business, offsetting growth in Xeon network CPUs and the ramp of our Mount Evans infrastructure processing unit.\nDespite second half macro headwinds, NEX set another full year record revenue at $8.9 billion up 11% year-over-year and marking consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth. Operating profit was $58 million in the fourth quarter, down year-on-year on mix shift to lower-margin segments and higher factory start-up costs.\nAXG achieved record quarterly revenue of $247 million, up 34% sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year, supported by the launch of Sapphire Rapids HBM. Operating loss was $441 million, down $63 million sequentially, with inventory valuations negatively impacted by softer demand, especially for crypto processors.\nMobileye delivered another record revenue quarter of $565 million, up 26% sequentially and growth of more than $200 million and 59% year-over-year. Full year revenue of $1.9 billion was also a record for Mobileye, growing 35% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter operating income of $210 million represents 71% growth year-over-year. IFS achieved record quarterly revenue of $319 million, up 87% sequentially and 30% year-over-year on increased automotive shipments. Operating loss was $31 million, a $72 million improvement sequentially on higher revenue.\nWe continue to reshape the company to drive to world-class product costs and operational efficiency. We remain committed to the $3 billion of '23 cost savings outlined on our Q3 earnings call, while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation and ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth.\nBefore turning to Q1 guidance, let me take a moment to discuss an accounting change that will impact our results beginning in the first quarter. Effective January 23, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. This change better reflects the demonstrated economic value of our machinery and equipment over time and is more aligned with the business model changes inherent to our IDM 2.0 strategy.\nThe growth of the IFS deal pipeline will extend the life of manufacturing nodes beyond what was practical within IDM 1.0. Disaggregated CPU architecture allows performance and cost optimization for each chiplet, better leveraging older nodes. And we are optimizing our core business around more sustainable capacity quarters to improve equipment utilization and maximize ROIC.\nThe change will be applied prospectively beginning Q1 '23. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of '22, we expect total depreciation expense in '23 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion. An approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expense and a $1.2 billion decrease in ending inventory values. This change will not be counted towards the $3 billion short-term or $8 billion to $10 billion long-term structural cost improvements we committed last quarter, and is intended to provide the most accurate reflection of company financial results to our owners.\nNow turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect first quarter revenue of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. In addition to continued macro headwinds, we expect customers will burn inventory at a meaningfully faster pace than the prior few quarters in response to macro TAM softness impacting CCG, DCAI, NEX lines of business.\nWe see potential for market conditions to improve faster than typical seasonality as third-party data shows macro headwinds easing in the second half of the year. While we're progressing toward a $3 billion spending reduction with significant austerity across the company, given the fixed cost nature of our business, we expect the sequential revenue decline will result in negative operating margin in the first quarter.\nWe're forecasting gross margin of 39%, a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.15 at the midpoint of revenue guidance, inclusive of $350 million to $500 million of operating margin benefit from the useful life accounting change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to OpEx. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q1 gross margin by 400 basis points.\nWe continue to evaluate all investments and will remain laser-focused on optimizing for ROI, adjusting for market conditions across operating expenses and capital assets.\nWhile we're not providing guidance beyond Q1, I'll touch on a few elements of our outlook. At Investor Day, we noted that during the investment phase of IDM 2.0, from 2022 through 2024, our model was to operate at approximately 35% net capital intensity.\nFor FY '23, despite the lower revenue level, we expect to be at or below the 35% model. Embedded in our assumptions are capital offsets of around 20% to 30% of growth CapEx including our innovative SCIP partnership with Brookfield. We expect FY '23 operating expenses of under $20 billion, a roughly 10% year-over-year decline, consistent with committed cost-cutting measures totaling $2 billion, adjusting for the depreciation change.\nAdjusted free cash flow will be below our Investor Day guide of approximately neutral in the first half of '23 and return back towards guardrails in second half '23.\nIn closing, we remain committed to the strategy and long-term financial model we laid out at Investor Day last year. The opportunity for strong revenue growth across our business unit portfolio and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. While we're not satisfied with near-term results, this market downturn represents an opportunity to accelerate the transformation necessary to achieve our long-term goals. I look forward to providing updates on our transformation journey as the year progresses.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nThank you, Dave. We will now move into the Q&A portion of our call. (Operator Instructions) With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first caller.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nThank you, operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window.\nI'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such, it does involve risks and uncertainties. Our press release provides more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe have also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter, and we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings release and earnings presentation include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.\nWith that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\nPatrick P. Gelsinger\n\nCEO & Director, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite growing economic headwinds, Q3 revenue was flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guidance. In June, we were one of the first companies to highlight an abrupt and pronounced slowdown in demand, which has brought it beyond our initial expectations and is now having an industry-wide impact across the electronic supply chain. We are adjusting our Q4 outlook, and we are planning for the economic uncertainty to persist into 2023.\nWhile we are not satisfied with our results, we remain laser-focused on controlling what we can, and we are pleased that our PC share stabilized in Q2 and is now showing meaningful improvement in Q3. Our server share, while not where we want it to be, is tracking in line with our expectations, and we are encouraged by good execution in the quarter against our product road map. In addition, we are intensifying our cost reduction and efficiency efforts, and we are aggressively moving into the next phase of IDM 2.0 geared to unlocking the full potential of the IDM advantage.\nThis afternoon, I will focus my comments in 3 areas: one, the key trends and dynamics that shape Q3 and are informing our outlook; two, the progress we are making on IDM 2.0, including our momentum on process and product road maps and our recent announcement that we are implementing an internal foundry model; and three, the actions underway to drive cost savings and efficiency gains aimed at accelerating our transformation.\nSpecific to trends we are seeing, along with further deterioration in consumer PC demand in Q3, enterprise demand has begun to slow. We expect PC units to decline mid- to high teens to approximately 295 million units in calendar year '22. Our own Q3 results reflect a strong product portfolio with Raptor Lake building on Alder Lake's momentum as well as working closely with customers to optimize their inventory, our market share and business objectives.\nWe are still shipping below PC consumption and the inventory correction continued in Q3, but not as quickly as we forecasted. Importantly, however, PC usage remains strong, demonstrating the increased utility and value of the PC and ultimately supporting a TAM well above pre-pandemic levels. We are targeting a calendar year '23 PC unit TAM of between 270 million and 295 million units with a strong brand and product line driving additional share, especially at premium ASPs.\nThe data center TAM is holding up better, although enterprise in China continue to show signs of weakness as to some but not all cloud customers. Across our infrastructure and industrial exposed businesses, NEX demand was very solid, though not immune from the weakening economy.\nPSG continues to be a true standout with record Q3 revenue, up over 25% year-over-year. PSG backlog is robust, and it continues to be an area where we are supply chain-limited.\nDespite the challenging business environment, we made solid progress toward our long-term transformation in Q3, and we remain fully committed to using the macro uncertainty to accelerate our efforts. Each quarter, our confidence grows in achieving our goal of 5 nodes in 4 years. But until 4, we are progressing towards a high-volume manufacturing and will tape out the production stepping at Meteor Lake in Q4. The first stepping of Granite Rapids is out of the fab, yielding well with Intel 3 continuing to progress on schedule. Intel 4 and 3 are our first nodes deploying EUV and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density.\nOn Intel 20A and 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFET and PowerVia, our first internal test chips, and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025.\nIFS is a major beneficiary of our TD progress, and we are excited to welcome NVIDIA to the RAMP-C program, which enables both commercial foundry customers and the U.S. Department of Defense to take advantage of Intel's at-scale investments in leading-edge technologies. Since Q2, IFS has expanded engagements to 7 out of the 10 largest foundry customers, coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 35 customer test chips. In addition, IFS increased qualified opportunities by $1 billion to over $7 billion in deal value, all before we welcome the Tower team with the expected completion of the merger in Q1 '23.\nOn the product front, we had a busy quarter. Within client, as mentioned earlier, we added to the strong Alder Lake momentum with the launch of Raptor Lake desktop in Q3, driving a more than a 40% improvement in multi-thread performance, unquestioned leadership in gaming, 6 gigahertz out of the box and record-setting overclocking. We currently have over 500 OEM design wins. We launched Intel Unison to deliver best-in-industry multi-device user experience. In addition, we saw a meaningful development progress across multiple OEM designs on Intel 4-based Meteor Lake with volume ramps in 2023.\nWe now have all elements of the AXG portfolio in production with A770 giving our discrete graphics efforts a strong boost. The Flex family is building a strong pipeline of data center use cases, and Ponte Vecchio is now production for HPC offerings and production blades deployed for lead customers. Combined with Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, PVC is the basis for strong traction with HPC customers like Argonne National Laboratory and Germany's Leibniz Supercomputing Centre.\nCSPs and telcos alike continue to move to software-based 5G vRAN and O-RAN deployments. We announced Sapphire Rapids EE with vRAN Boost for in-line acceleration of 5G and network workloads. Edge and AI are proving a powerful combination for us with OpenVINO momentum building with customers like Chipotle, and we launched the Intel Geti computer vision software platform for RapidAI training with early customers such as Braven, Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals. Further evidence of our AI portfolio taking shape was seen by Red Hat announcing support for Gaudi, Cnvrg.io and OpenVINO.\nInspur announced Gaudi2 with Sapphire Rapids for advanced AI use cases. Amazon will be accelerating large transform models with Gaudi instances in EC2.\nThis was also a very strong quarter for DCAI execution. Sapphire Rapids volume SKUs have now PRQed for a high-quality leadership product and a very strong volume ramp expected. Google gave the first preview of its C3 instances showing Sapphire Rapids capabilities as well as our leadership IPU, the E3200 or Mount Evans.\nWe also saw strong milestones in the next 3 generations of server products. Emerald Rapids is showing good progress and is on track for calendar year '23. Granite Rapids is very healthy running multiple operating systems across many configurations. And with Sierra Forest, our first E-core product, providing world-class performance per watt are both solidly on track for '24.\nIt's obvious, but we're stating our strategy is only as good as our execution. We have been taking aggressive action to rebuild our execution engine, driving execution excellence across our people, design and development and operations. In Q1, I discussed our return to OKRs and their importance to our culture.\nLast quarter, I touched upon the next evolution of our tick-tock model, or tick-tock 2, as a disciplined approach to consistent, predictable product execution. This quarter, I wanted to spend a bit of time on operational excellence and discuss our recently announced IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office, or IAO, ushering in the next phase of our IDM 2.0 strategy.\nDuring the first phase of IDM 2.0, we aggressively focus on making the needed investments to approve our TD road map to regain transistor leadership and to ensure we have at-scale manufacturing capacity by building ahead on shells. Improvements in both areas now enables us to move forward with our next set of priorities, evolving our systems, business practices and culture to embrace an internal foundry model and establish a leadership cost structure. This means we will create what I like to call a new and clean API for the company by establishing consistent processes, systems and guardrails between our manufacturing teams and our business units. This will place our BUs on the same economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings.\nWe have already identified 9 different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue. For example, product teams will be heavily incented to drive the high-quality A0 steppings, as they see the full cost of steppings, validation cycles, hot lots and capacity changes. Factories will move to rigorous capacity loading cycles, transparency of cost for loading changes and efficiency of capital utilization, structural and variable wafer costs.\nIn addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. It will also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L into calendar year '24, ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are creating value and allocating your capital.\nA key benefit of IDM 2.0 is to unlock our full financial potential by capturing multiple profit pools not available to any one of our peers across architecture, design, wafer manufacturing, advanced packaging, supply chain and software. These pools were only partially (inaudible) long-term margin targets we established at Investor Day in February.\nSimple math would suggest there is meaningful upside to those targets as we execute and exploit the margin-stacking potential IDM 2.0 provides. Best-in-class semiconductor companies achieved gross margin in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s. And we aim to be best-in-class. This next phase of IDM 2.0 is a significant evolution in how we think and operate as a company. But just as we optimize to drive outside returns in the IDM 1.0 era, we will optimize to achieve best-in-class returns in the IDM 2.0 era. It's what engineers do, and we have the best engineers on the planet.\nComplementing and augmenting these efforts will be an intensified focus to reduce costs and drive efficiencies in everything we do. As we stated during Q2 earnings, we have an obligation to our owners to be good stewards of your capital. We are responding to the current environment by taking aggressive actions to reduce costs across COGS and OpEx while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation, ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth.\nIn addition to reducing near-term costs, we have also identified structural cost reductions and efficiency drivers, which Dave will outline a bit later.\nIn aggregate, our efforts should drive $3 billion in annual savings in the near term and $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2025. Not captured in these estimates are the start-up costs to support 5 nodes in 4 years which will begin to subside beyond calendar year '26, adding an additional $2 billion in COGS savings. Inclusive in our efforts will be steps to optimize our head count. These are difficult decisions affecting our loyal Intel family, but we need to balance increased investment in areas like leadership and TD product and capacity in Ohio and Germany with efficiency measures elsewhere as we drive to have best-in-class structures.\nWe will also continue to use our smart capital approach to support and inform our capital spending aspirations, aggressively building ahead on shells while aligning equipment purchases and installs with customer demand.\nWe continue to see skips like our partnership with Brookfield as an innovative financial structure to more closely align fab build-out costs with fab output returns. Likewise, we see U.S. and EU chips as vital to enable us to establish a geographically diverse and secure supply chain for the semiconductor industry. We are confident in reaccelerating free cash flow growth and driving industry-leading free cash flow margins once we get through this period of economic uncertainty affecting the entire industry and our own elevated investments to accelerate our transformation.\nLastly, I was particularly pleased to join the Mobileye team earlier this week in New York to witness firsthand the successful completion of their IPO, especially in a difficult market. We believe that this will help unlock Mobileye's full operational and financial potential and is an additional avenue to create value for our owners. We remain committed to optimizing our value creation efforts through portfolio honing, reallocation of resources to higher returns, higher-growth businesses, M&A and where applicable, divestitures.\nBefore turning it over to Dave, I want to close by saying I continue to be heartened and impressed by the dedication and commitment of all of our employees by far, the most important owners of this great company. They are passionately committed like me to reestablish Intel as a dominant driver of innovation and by the opportunity to improve the lives of everyone on the planet.\nIt was also rewarding to see that same drive and dedication in the faces of our broader developer community at Intel Innovation, the rebirth of Intel IDF in September. We are the building blocks, an enabler of their vision and aspirations, and it is our commitment to them to be great partners and collaborators. Our ambitions are equal by our passions and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IDM 2.0.\n\nDavid A. Zinsner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid third quarter despite the macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. We expect these headwinds to persist and as a result, we're lowering our expectations for the fourth quarter. We will continue to be laser-focused on the things that we can control and use economic uncertainty to accelerate our transformation and drive cost cutting and efficiency gains.\nMoving to Q3 results. Revenue was $15.3 billion, flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guide. Q3 revenue benefited from CCG's strength, offset by declining TAMs in DCAI and NEX. Gross margin for the quarter was 46%, below our guide, but largely in line relative to lower Q3 revenue. Q3 gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially on lower inventory reserves.\nEPS was $0.59, $0.24 above our guide largely on lower-than-forecasted taxes. Adjusting for the lower tax rate, EPS would have been $0.37, $0.02 above our guide on better expense management.\nOperational cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion. Net CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.3 billion. And we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash balances of $23 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade credit profile.\nTurning to our business unit results. CCG revenue was $8.1 billion, up 6% sequentially, driven by higher ASPs on better mix and also benefiting from our efforts to work with customers to maximize our share position ahead of Q4 price increases. CCG revenue was down 17% year-over-year as customers continue to reduce inventory and we continue to under ship demand.\nDemand weakness year-over-year was most pronounced in the consumer, education and small medium business markets. Operating profit was $1.7 billion, up $570 million sequentially and down 54% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product road map.\nDCAI revenue was $4.2 billion, down 27% year-over-year on TAM reductions and continued competitive pressures even as market share continues to track in line with our expectations. Operating profit was $17 million, below expectations and down significantly year-over-year. Profitability was impacted by lower revenue, higher advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs on transition to 10 nanometers.\nWe also continue to invest aggressively in the product road map. NEX revenue was $2.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year on increased demand for 5G, Ethernet and edge products, partially offset by lower network Xeon demand. In Q3, we started to see macro-driven demand softness and customer inventory management impact NEX. Operating profit was $75 million, down 85% year-over-year due to the impact of softer demand on inventory valuation and increased road map investment.\nAXG revenue was $185 million, up 8% year-over-year on the ramp of our Blockscale products. Operating loss was $378 million, $129 million better sequentially, but $156 million worse than year-over-year due to softer demand and product readiness impacting inventory valuation as well as increased investment to deliver the visual, supercompute and custom accelerated graphics road maps.\nMobileye revenue was $450 million, up $124 million from Q3 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. Operating income was $142 million, up $15 million from Q3 2021, primarily due to higher revenue. IFS revenue was $171 million, down 2% year-over-year, driven by automotive weakness with customers citing third-party component shortages, partially offset by growth in core foundry and IMS businesses. Operating loss was $103 million versus an operating loss of $44 million in Q3 '21 on increased spending to enable our foundry growth strategy.\nTurning to Q4 guidance. Given the deteriorating macro environment and based on input from our customers, we're now guiding Q4 revenue in a range of $14 billion to $15 billion with sequential decline driven by lower CCG revenue as customers reduced inventory lower NEX TAM and continued DCAI headwinds. We're forecasting gross margin of 45%, a tax rate of 14% and EPS of $0.20 at the midpoint of revenue guidance.\nFor Q4 adjusted free cash flow, we expect to see a meaningful sequential increase driven by working capital improvements and a $2 billion reduction in net CapEx, adjusting for a lower demand environment. These benefits will be partially offset by lower revenue. And as a result, we're reducing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to negative $2 billion to negative $4 billion. There is also a possibility that a portion of expected capital offsets could move from Q4 to Q1, shifting the cash flow benefit into next year.\nConsistent with our short-term financial model discussed at our Investor Day in February, our continued intent is to manage, adjust this free cash flow at approximately breakeven as we go through this period of accelerated and elevated investments supported by our smart capital approach and the multiple pools of capital available to finance our strategy.\nNow turning to our long-term outlook and the changes we're making to transform the business. Beyond Q4, there's a high degree of macroeconomic uncertainty, and it appears that the current challenging market environment will extend well into 2023 with the potential for a global recession. Further, as I discussed in Q2 earnings, it's imperative that we drive for world-class product cost and operational efficiency to achieve our long-term financial model. As Pat detailed earlier, to accelerate this transformation, we're forming the IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office and doubling down on our efforts to reduce costs and find efficiencies across the organization.\nWe'll start with a focus on driving $3 billion of cost reduction in 2023, 1/3 in cost of sales and 2/3 in operating expenses. Note that our Q3 results include GAAP restructuring charges of $664 million that reflect initial efforts to rightsize our business and deliver these savings. In Q4, we expect to have additional restructuring charges of similar magnitude as we further rationalize our 2023 financial plan.\nLonger term, we will execute on continued structural cost savings and efficiency gains, which we expect to drive $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings by the end of 2025, split roughly 2/3 in cost of sales and 1/3 in operating expense. These savings will be realized through multiple initiatives to optimize the business, including portfolio cuts, rightsizing of our support organizations, more stringent cost controls in all aspects of our spending and improved sales and marketing efficiency.\nAs Pat outlined, also critical to driving this transformation is the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, dramatically increasing financial accountability and transparency, enabling all organizations to drive to world-class product cost and efficiency benchmarks. In addition, as we emerge from 5 nodes in 4 years and slower technology development cadence, we expect an additional approximately 200 basis points of gross margin after 2026. We expect these efforts to provide potential upside to the financial targets we provided at the February Investor Day.\nThis will be a multiyear journey, but as Pat said earlier, best-in-class semiconductor companies have a financial profile that includes gross margins in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s, and we aim to be best-in-class. In the short term, we will continue to manage to the OpEx, net capital intensity and adjusted free cash flow guardrails established and drive back to a gross margin percentage range of 51% to 53% once economic conditions improve and revenue growth returns.\nIn closing, we remain committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day. The compelling long-term financial opportunity of strong revenue growth across our 6 business units and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly make the transformation necessary to achieve these goals.\nWith that, let me turn it back over to John and get to your questions.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nThank you, Dave.

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI will now hand the conference over to your speakers today, John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Intel. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nYou should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window for those joining us online.\nI'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we'll hear brief comments from both, followed by Q&A.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such, it involves risks and uncertainties. Our press release provides more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe've also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter, and we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentations and the release are available on intc.com, include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Pat.\n\nPatrick P. Gelsinger\n\nCEO & Director, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. While we continue to make solid progress on our strategy, Q2 results were disappointing, below the standards we have set for the company and below the commitments we have made to you, our shareholders. The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver of the shortfall, but Q2 also reflected our own execution issues in areas like product design, DCAI and the ramp of AXG offerings. We have an obligation to remain vigilant and to respond to changing business conditions while not losing sight of our long-term goals and opportunities. We will look to do both by adjusting and refocusing our spending levels in the near term at the same time as we accelerate the deployment of our smart capital strategy and improve product execution. Collectively, these actions will begin to show dividends in the second half of the year, allowing us to return gross margins to our target range by Q4 and maintain our initial free cash flow outlook for 2022.\nWhile still early in our journey, we remain laser-focused on executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products, anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. The current economic backdrop only strengthens our result, and we are embracing this environment to accelerate our transformation.\nFor example, regaining our leadership begins with Moore's Law and the capacity to deliver it at scale. Over the last 18 months, we've taken the right steps to establish a strong footing for our TD roadmap. We are well into the ramp of Intel 7, now shipping in excess of 35 million units. Intel 4 is ready for volume production in second half of this year, and Intel 3, 20A and 18A are all at or ahead of schedule.\nWe've received additional strong third-party validation for TD, IFS and our manufacturing group just this week when we announced MediaTek as our next major foundry customer, a great example of our One Intel culture.\nI want to congratulate our teams on what we expect to be many announcements as we execute to become an at-scale, leading edge, geographically diversified systems foundry. But we must also be clear eyed as we look into the second half. We are planning for volatility as the world adjusts to the end of a 2-plus year pandemic and the unprecedented stimulus governments used to fight it.\nAcross the economy, supply chain issues have both limited the ability to meet demand in some areas and driven inventory well above normal levels in others. We are prepared to manage through a slowdown typical of the normal cycles the semiconductor industry has experienced over the last 50 years. While the depth and duration are still difficult to predict, we have a proven track record of being able to adjust and succeed in any environment.\nLet me address some of the specific actions we are taking. First, we further sharpened our focus in Q2, selling our Drone business and making the difficult decision to wind down our efforts in Optane as we embrace CXL, a standard which Intel Corporation pioneered. These add to actions last year in NAND in the sale of McAfee. In total, we have now exited 6 businesses since my return, providing roughly $1.5 billion for investments aligned with our IDM 2.0 strategy.\nWe are also lowering core expenses in calendar year '22, and we'll look to take additional actions in the second half of the year, which Dave will address later. Importantly, expense discipline is not impacting the strategy, and we remain firmly on track to achieve process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership in 2025. This goal is our true North Star.\nSecond, our ability to invest aggressively and fulfill our commitment to a strong and growing dividend is anchored by the progress we are making in deploying our smart capital strategy. We are thrilled to see the bipartisan vote in the Congress this week and expect CHIPS Act to be on the President's desk shortly.\nWe have been integrally involved in moving this groundbreaking legislation forward. This progress, combined with the strong momentum in Europe, will reshape our industry and bring us toward a geographically balanced, resilient supply chain that we are uniquely positioned to enable and benefit from. Access to mission-aligned pools of capital supports the accelerated pursuit of our strategy and will enable our torrid pace.\nThird, I rejoined Intel to reenergize and reestablish a culture of execution and innovation. With process technology and capacity expansion both now trending very well, we have the critical foundation we need for improved product execution. We have rebuilt our leadership team, now fully assembled for the first time. And together, we have reestablished OKRs throughout the organization to drive common purpose and, importantly, a system of accountability.\nIn the coming months, we will begin to share more with the investment community on the next evolution of our TikTok model to drive consistent and predictable cadence of process and design innovation.\nAs we look beyond the near term, the semiconductor industry continues to be at the beginning of a new structural growth phase driven by 4 superpowers: one, ubiquitous compute; two, pervasive connectivity; three, cloud-to-edge infrastructure; and four, AI. Combined, these drivers support a semiconductor industry eclipsing $1 trillion by 2030. What remains very clear even during this period of uncertainty is the growing importance of silicon to the global economy and to each of our daily lives.\nHowever, as a result of macro weaknesses, we now expect the PC TAM to decline roughly 10% in calendar year '22, characterized by broadening consumer weakness and relative strength in enterprise and higher-end SKUs. Importantly, our Q2 PC unit volumes suggests we are shipping below consumption as some of our largest customers are reducing inventory levels at a rate not seen in the last decade and, along with some pricing actions, should allow for sequential growth into the second half even as some customers manage inventory lower.\nWhile COVID-related dynamics, like work-from-home and school-from-home, pulled forward some demand, they also solidified the PC as an essential tool in the post-pandemic world. For example, PC and Chromebook usage remains historically high even as the pandemic's most acute impacts diminished. Markedly higher per PC usage and a larger installed base, including 600 million PCs that are 4 years and older, supports a PC TAM sustainably above 300 million units.\nData center trends are still well entrenched. Data has been growing exponentially at a 50% CAGR for over 20 years. But until recently, it has been uneconomical to turn that data into true actionable insights. With the advent of AI, along with CPUs, GPUs and accelerators, we now have the tools to access and use more of the data we create, driving significantly higher compute demand and a multiyear CAGR in the data center TAM of at least mid-teens.\nDespite these drivers, demand will not be immune from economic headwinds. In addition to match set issues, which have constrained shipments for multiple quarters, increasing economic concerns are leading to a reduction in second half demand. As a result, we have lowered our server TAM assumptions to reflect more modest growth in 2022.\nAgainst this backdrop, let me highlight key developments in our businesses. In response to supply chain and match set issues, we closely collaborated with our customers and suppliers to effectively address their most critical needs. We rapidly adjusted to changing market conditions, made cost reductions and leveraged smart capital to execute towards our IDM 2.0 strategy.\nDespite significantly lower revenue impacting overall gross margins, Q2 saw continued strong performance in our factory network, and we exceeded our wafer cost goals with 10-nanometer unit cost declining approximately 8% year-on-year. In TD, we continued to deliver on the promise of Moore's Law and our ambitions to deliver 1 trillion transistors in the device by 2030.\nIntel 4 details were released at the recent VLSI conference to positive reviews, and we've now taped in the first stepping of the Granite Rapids CPU and expect to power on this quarter. In the second half of this year, we plan to tape in numerous internal and foundry customer test chips on various process nodes, including Intel 3 and Intel 18A.\nIn our client business, Alder Lake momentum continues. We have the strongest PC lineup in 5-plus years, and we remain unapologetic about our growing leadership and share position. We are building on Alder Lake leadership with Raptor Lake in the second half of this year and Meteor Lake in 2023, exemplifying how our innovative design decisions can drive leadership performance even before reestablishing best-in-class transistor technology.\nIn Q2, we launched the 12th Gen Intel Core HX processors, the final products in our Alder Lake family. The Alder Lake family is now powering more than 525 designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, Samsung and others. To date, we've shipped well in excess of 35 million units of Alder Lake.\nWithin the current market, we are also seeing relative strength in the premium segments we serve across consumer and commercial. We expect to build on this momentum with the launch of our next-gen product family, Raptor Lake, starting with our desktop SKUs this fall, followed by our mobile family by the end of the year. The Raptor Lake family will offer customers significant advantages, including double-digit performance gains, gen-on-gen and socket compatibility with Alder Lake. And in 2023, we will deliver our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4, Meteor Lake, which is showing good health in both our and our customers' labs.\nTurning to DCAI, as we stated at Investor Day, over the next couple of years, as we rebuild our server product portfolio, we expect to grow slower than the overall data center market. It's not a fact we like but the forecast we see. We have a singular focus to regain performance and TCO leadership across all workloads and use cases from enterprise to cloud.\nThe advantage of our incumbency position remains underappreciated and provides significant opportunity to drive outsized advantages to our customers. For example, we expanded our supply agreement with Meta, leveraging our IDM advantage to ensure Meta can meet its expanding compute needs. Also in Q2, we agreed to expand our partnership with AWS to include the co-development of multigenerational data center solutions optimized for AWS infrastructure. And Intel is a strategic customer for internal workloads, including EDA. We expect these custom Xeon solutions will bring greater levels of differentiation and a durable TCO advantage to AWS and their customers, including Intel.\nIn addition, NVIDIA announced the selection of Sapphire Rapids for use in their new DGX H100, which will couple Sapphire Rapids with NVIDIA's Hopper GPUs to deliver unprecedented AI performance.\nBeyond Xeon-based CPUs, we launched our next-generation Gaudi2 AI accelerator in the quarter, with a whopping 4x improvement generation to generation. And in the most recent MLPerf training benchmark test, Gaudi2 has a substantial lead in ResNet-50 and BERT benchmarks.\nIn the second quarter, we also began delivering our software strategy with the acquisition of Granulate, expanding our platform capabilities with real-time AI-driven continuous optimizations for cloud computing and the initial release of Amber, our security attestation service. Since we acquired Granulate, their customer pipeline has doubled and their revenue pipeline has tripled.\nFinally, Programmable Solutions achieved record 2Q revenue and was just shy of an all-time record revenue quarter driven by strong demand, including the ramp of the flagship Agilex FPGA family and improving supply.\nIn NEX, we had an outstanding Q2. We achieved record revenue in PRQ-ed Mount Evans, an IPU we co-developed and are now beginning to ramp with a large hyperscale partner with additional customers in 2023. In addition, our latest Xeon D processor built specifically for software-defined infrastructure across the network and edge, launched at this year's Mobile World Congress and is ramping with leading companies, including Cisco, Juniper Networks and Rakuten Symphony.\nAcross the network edge, we're continuing to see interest to deploy more compute and AI capabilities. For example, Ferrovial, a multinational Spanish infrastructure company is using our edge computing, AI and connectivity technologies to deploy roadside solutions that can identify wrong way drivers, warn of oncoming hazards and more.\nIn Singapore, Singtel has deployed a network solution with Xeon Smart Edge and OpenVINO to improve user experience for use cases like entertainment, industrial, smart manufacturing, smart transportation and smart city.\nLastly, ABB is helping utility providers modernize their electric grid and create a more sustainable energy market by adopting standardized rugged servers based on third-gen Intel Xeon. NEX continues to clearly benefit from networks that are increasingly moving towards software and AI that is increasingly moving to the edge, and we expect another revenue record quarter in Q3.\nFor AXG, while we will not hit our GPU unit target, we remain on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year. In Q2, we started to ramp Intel Art Graphics for laptops and OEMs, including Samsung, Lenovo, Acer, HP and Asus. COVID-related supply chain issues and our own software readiness challenges caused the availability delays that we continue to work to overcome.\nIntel Arc A5 and A7 desktop cards will start to ship in Q3. Our energy-efficient blockchain accelerator, Blockscale, achieved a major milestone in Q2 with revenue shipments to our lead customers going from tape-in to shipping in less than a year. We expect to ship millions of units this year, not originally in our forecast.\nOur data center GPU, codenamed Arctic Sound-M, has started production and is now shipping to customers, supporting a diverse range of workloads starting with media streaming and cloud gaming, followed by support for AI visual inference and virtual desktops.\nIn high-performance computing, we highlighted the installation of the Argonne National Lab Aurora Supercomputer at our Intel Vision events in May, and we are on track to deliver over 10,000 blades in 2022, enabling over 2 exaflops of peak performance. We also announced new partnerships, including the Barcelona Supercomputing Center to set up a pioneering RISC-V zettascale lab and our continued collaboration with the University of Cambridge to evolve their current lab from exascale to zettascale.\nOur IFS momentum continues, creating a geographically balanced secure and resilient semiconductor supply chain as well as access to our transistor technology is driving strong customer interest in our foundry business. In addition to the MediaTek agreement that we announced earlier this week, we now have active engagements with 6 of the top 10 fabless customers across our offerings, including 18A.\nOverall, we are engaged with 30 customers for test chips, and now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages across our process and package offerings that collectively represents a deal value of greater than $6 billion.\nAugmenting our organic activity is our proposed acquisition of Tower Semiconductor. We now have regulatory approval or clearance in 4 geographies, including the U.S., and we still expect the acquisition to close by early next year.\nIn Q2, we also launched the IFS Cloud Alliance, a partnership with leading cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure and AWS and EDA tool providers, including Ansys, Cadence, Siemens EDA and Synopsys. The IFS Cloud Alliance is the next phase of our accelerator ecosystem program that will enable secure design environments in the cloud, improving foundry customer design efficiency and accelerating time to market.\nLastly, in Mobileye, we achieved another record quarter in revenue in Q2, and we continue to be poised to unlock further value with our proposed IPO later this year, pending market conditions. Mobileye's backlog continues to grow, with first half 2022 design wins generating 37 million units of projected future business compared to 16 million units actually shipped in the first half. As a result to Mobileye's high-definition map product called REM, we are currently crowdsourcing 43 million miles per day on average from approximately 1.5 million vehicles. This data is automatically built into a map, which currently covers greater than 90% of all roads in both Europe and U.S., which will support systems across the entire driving assist to autonomous vehicle spectrum.\nLooking ahead, before turning it over to Dave, I want to close with a few thoughts. First, after a very successful Intel Vision event in Q2, I am looking forward to hosting Intel Innovation on September 27 and 28, our core technical conference for global developers, architects and engineering leaders. I hope to see many of you joining me there.\nSecond, as I said when we began our journey, Intel will be a source of innovation, driving new businesses and additional TAM in large and growing markets. Taken together, we have already announced over 10 new revenue-producing product lines so far this year, which are just beginning to ramp, and we expect to announce more in the second half and calendar year '23. The foundations for our growth story are taking shape. I know I speak for all of our employees when I say that, while we have work to do, our best days are ahead.\n\nDavid A. Zinsner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pat. Good afternoon, everyone. As Pat referenced, Q2 was a challenging quarter, negatively impacted by multiple factors. First, a weakening and uncertain macroeconomic environment impacted by inflation, higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Second, a much larger-than-expected OEM inventory correction as our customers adjust to this new macroeconomic environment. Third, worse-than-expected COVID-driven demand reductions and supply dislocations in China and other parts of the supply chain. Due to the difficult macroeconomic environment, together with our own execution challenges, our results for the quarter were well below expectations and necessitate a significant revision to our full year financial guidance.\nThat said, we're taking the actions necessary to maintain our prior full year adjusted free cash flow guidance, including a slowdown in hiring, CapEx reductions and the expectation for increased capital offsets, consistent with our smart capital strategy. We remain fully committed to the business strategy and long-term financial model presented during this year's investor meeting in February.\nRevenue was $15.3 billion, 15% below our original Q2 guidance as our CCG and DCAI businesses both underperformed our expectations. Note that even in this challenging environment, our NEX and Mobileye businesses achieved all-time record quarterly revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 45%, 600 basis points below guidance on lower revenue and Sapphire Rapids preproduction charges, offset by lower manufacturing costs.\nEPS was $0.29, $0.41 below our guide on lower revenue and gross profit, offset by lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $800 million. CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, resulting in an adjusted cash flow of negative $6.4 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments of $27.5 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade credit profile.\nNow turning to our business unit results. CCG revenue was $7.7 billion, below expectations and down 25% year-over-year on global TAM weakness, particularly in the consumer education and small-medium business markets. The shortfall was also driven by OEM inventory reductions as we work with our customers to lower their inventory, protect market share and continue to manage through match set constraints.\nCPU ASPs were up 11% year-over-year on richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 73% year-over-year, on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform roadmap.\nDCAI revenue was $4.6 billion, below expectations and down 16% year-over-year on OEM inventory reductions, mix-related ASP decline and competitive pressures. Operating profit was $214 million, down 90% year-over-year on lower revenue, higher advanced node start-up costs, increased investment in the product roadmap and Sapphire Rapids' preproduction charges.\nNEX achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $2.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year on strength in data center networking products, specifically networking Ethernet and 5G. Operating profit was $241 million, down 60% year-over-year on mix shift to networking Ethernet and 5G, increased investment in process technology and lower sell-through of reserved inventory.\nAXG revenue was $186 million, up 5% year-over-year on the ramp of supercompute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. Operating loss was $507 million versus an operating loss of $168 million in Q2 '21, with the increase driven by inventory reserves on our Ponte Vecchio and Alchemist products, and increased investment to deliver the roadmap of visual supercompute and custom accelerated graphics products.\nMobileye achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $460 million, up 41% year-over-year, outperforming the rate of increase of global automotive production, which was relatively flat year-over-year. Operating profit was $190 million, up 43% year-over-year on higher revenue, partially offset by increased investment in next-generation ADAS products.\nIFS revenue was $122 million, down 54% year-over-year, driven by lower mass tool sales, as well as revenue decrease in the automotive segment due to customer shortages in the automotive market. Operating loss was $155 million versus an operating profit of $52 million in Q2 '21, driven by lower revenue and increased investment to build out the custom foundry business.\nBefore we transition to full year and Q3 guidance, after 6 months on the job, let me provide my perspectives on the opportunities I see and focus areas to improve our financial performance and achieve our long-term goals.\nAt the highest level, I see opportunities to improve in 2 areas. First, ensuring we are allocating our capital to the programs that are clearly aligned to our revised business strategy and generate maximum long-term value to our shareholders. As Pat mentioned, 2 good examples of continuing to optimize our portfolio are exiting the Optane and Drone businesses. We continue to deeply evaluate all opportunities to more narrowly focus our resources on the highest value programs, increasing the probability of success for each of these programs.\nSecond, driving structural product cost and operational expense efficiency across the company, taking full advantage of our IDM 2.0 strategy. A major focus for me is driving Intel to world-class product cost. Key to this is executing our 5 nodes and 4-year strategy, but there are many more aspects to achieving this goal with programs in flight to dramatically reduce product cost. Likewise, there are opportunities in OpEx to ensure we are achieving world-class efficiency in everything we do. With my history in the memory business where every penny counts, I know there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar. As part of these focus areas, we expect to see restructuring charges in Q3, and I'll continue to provide regular updates on these efforts.\nMoving to our full year and Q3 guidance. For the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to soften with the potential for a recessionary scenario to materialize. There's also risk for continued COVID-related impacts on demand and the supply chain to continue throughout the year. As a result of this high level of uncertainty, we're moving to a range-based approach to revenue guidance for the rest of the year.\nFor full year revenue, we are now guiding a range of $65 billion to $68 billion, down from our prior guidance of $76 billion, driven by lower expectations for our CCG and DCAI businesses. More specifically, in our PC business, as Pat discussed, we now see TAM decreasing approximately 10% year-over-year due to the softening macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year due to seasonal strength, OEM inventory returning to balanced levels, inflation-related price increases to take effect and the ramp of our leadership Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products to position us to compete for share.\nFor DCAI, we expect to see second half revenue growth relative to Q2 levels, but growth will remain muted as competitive and macroeconomic headwinds persist, OEM inventory reductions continue and component constraints impact certain segments.\nFor NEX, we expect another record quarter in Q3 and continued growth throughout the year. NEX revenue tailwinds will be fueled by new product introductions, data center and telco networking demand and continued improvement in pricing and component supply.\nFor AXG, we continue to expect full year revenue greater than $1 billion, driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound-M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. And finally, we expect to see second half growth in each of our 2 remaining businesses, Mobileye and IFS as they ramp new products and secure new customers.\nFor full year gross margin, we're guiding to 49% at the midpoint of revenue guidance with the expectation that gross margin will return to the low end of our target range of 51% to 53% in Q4 as revenue increases, we achieve scale on new product ramps and costs continue to improve. We're forecasting a tax rate of approximately 8% and EPS of $2.30 at the midpoint of the revenue guidance.\nFor net CapEx, we're revising down our forecast to $23 billion, $4 billion less than our previous guidance as we moderately adjust our investment in capacity and take advantage of potentially larger than originally forecast capital [assets], highlighting significant progress on our smart capital strategy. We expect these actions to offset lower than originally forecast operating cash flow, allowing us to reaffirm adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to negative $2 billion for the year.\nFinally, we paid dividends of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year, and remain committed to growing the dividend over time.\nNow moving to Q3 guidance. Given the aforementioned market environment, we're guiding revenue of $15 billion to $16 billion. At the midpoint of the revenue guidance, we're guiding gross margin of 46.5%, a tax rate of 13% and earnings per share of $0.35.\nIn closing, the market turbulence and updated outlook are disappointing. However, we believe our turnaround is clearly taking shape and expect Q2 and Q3 to be the financial bottom for the company.\nWe remain completely committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day. The long-term financial opportunity of compelling revenue growth and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly make the transformations necessary to achieve these goals.\nWith that, let me turn it back over to John and get to your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker host, Tony Balow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTony Balow\n\nSenior Director of IR, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Intel's first quarter earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, Dave Zinsner. In a moment, we'll have brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, it does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nA brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include both the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Pat.\n\nPatrick P. Gelsinger\n\nCEO & Director, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Tony, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 was another solid quarter where we beat on the top line, exceeded our guidance on gross margin and EPS, and where we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy to unlock a $1 trillion market opportunity. As we laid out at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is built around 4 key pillars. We will deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. In Q1, we made great progress in all of these areas, and we are continuing to hold our full year revenue outlook.\nIn our data center and AI group, we began shipping initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers as planned. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map that strengthens our position in both per core performance and performance per watt for cloud and enterprise workloads. We launched our Arc A-Series GPUs for laptops, taking our first steps to give the graphics industry a much needed new addition. Mobileye demonstrated its Level 4 self-driving system in Jerusalem, a major milestone in preparation for its upcoming robotaxi services.\nWe continue to add to our talent with strong industry leaders like Christoph Schell, who recently joined us from HP as our Chief Commercial Officer. And finally, we took another major step in creating a balanced semiconductor supply chain with the announcement of our plans for new investments in Europe. We also held the grand opening of our latest leading-edge factory in Oregon, including a new name for the campus, the Gordon Moore Park at Ronler Acres, which recognizes our founder and the site's unique contribution to driving Moore's Law.\nQ1 also marked a special moment for Intel as we announced our plans to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and develop more sustainable technology solutions, including using 100% renewable energy across our global operations by 2030 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our global operations by 2040.\nOverall, Q1 was a great start to the year as we continue to execute on the path to our long-term growth story. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are executing at a torrid pace, and I remain confident in our path forward.\nBefore I get into specific updates for each of our business units, let me start with some observations of what we are seeing in the industry. I continue to believe we are just at the beginning of a long-term growth cycle across semiconductors. We continue to see some match set limitations in areas like Ethernet, some softening in low-end consumer PC and some inventory adjustments, as we discussed on our last call. But overall, the demand signals from customers continue to be robust in areas like enterprise, cloud, AI, graphics and networking.\nSemiconductors are the fuel of innovation and transformation across a wide range of industries. In the supply chain, lockdowns in Shanghai and the war in Ukraine have demonstrated more than ever that the world needs more resilient and more geographically-balanced semiconductor manufacturing. The chip shortage costs the U.S. economy $240 billion last year and we expect the industry will continue to see challenges until at least 2024 in areas like foundry capacity and tool availability.\nAs an IDM, we believe we are in a good position in the industry to manage through these constraints. In fact, Intel is rising to meet this challenge. Following our announcements in Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio, we recently announced a series of investments in Europe, spanning our existing operations as well as our new investments in France and Germany, the Silicon Junction. These investments position Intel to meet the future growth and represent a significant step toward our moonshot goal of having half the world's semiconductor manufacturing located in the U.S. and Europe.\nThe pace at which we can reach this goal is dependent on the actions of the U.S. and other governments. America showed leadership when Congress passed the CHIPS Act, but the global situation has grown even more serious since then. The EU has been very aggressive in moving legislation forward to meet this challenge, and I recently testified before the Senate to highlight the critical need for the U.S. to fund the CHIPS Act. I continue to encourage Congress to fund this critical legislation and enable us to move faster towards making a balanced semiconductor supply chain a reality.\nTurning now to Intel. We continue to make great progress on our plans to deliver 5 process nodes in 4 years. Intel 7 is ramping extremely well with Alder Lake and on Intel 4, Meteor Lake has now successfully booted Windows 12 and Linux. The speed at which the team was able to achieve this milestone is a significant sign of the health of both Meteor Lake and our Intel 4 process technology.\nWe plan to deliver several additional milestones in 2022, demonstrating our process technology development remains on track. This includes early Sierra Forest preproduction wafers on Intel 3, IP test wafers on Intel 28 and foundry customer test chips and initial IP shovels on Intel 18A. Simply put, we remain on and, in some places, ahead of schedule to deliver 5 nodes in 4 years.\nOur manufacturing network continues to perform well in a challenging environment. For the first time in years, Intel fabs and our substrate supply are close to meeting our customers' demand. Using our IDM advantage, the team was able to remix almost 3 million units within lead time to meet changing demand signals. For example, we were able to partner with Meta to improve their Xeon supply and meet their needs. Finally, our supply chain resilience showed as our teams work tirelessly to mitigate any significant disruptions to our factory operations from the war in Ukraine, supplier shutdowns and COVID lockdowns in China.\nTurning to our business groups. At our Investor Day, we laid out our long-term growth strategy centered around 6 distinct but highly complementary business units, a structure that provides investment flexibility, increased market resilience and enhanced transparency for investors. And in fact, we will report our results in this structure for the first time today.\nOur client group continues to deliver world-class platforms, positioning us to win share, grow ASP and win share of market. There is broad ecosystem agreement that the long-term PC market is sustainably larger going forward driven by PC density, refresh rates and increased penetration as the PC remains the essential tool for work, learn and play. We are seeing particular strength in gaming and in commercial PCs that is somewhat tempered by a slower consumer inflationary pressure and customer inventory management, which Dave will talk more to later.\nOur 12th gen Alder Lake family continues to ramp in Q1, and we have already shipped more than 15 million units. This family now has more than 250 designs planned this year from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Samsung and others. And it includes the world's fastest desktop processor, the Core i9-1200KS (sic) [Core i9-12900KS]. Alder Lake will scale across every segment, including for businesses of all sizes with the launch of our latest vPro platform. vPro offers industry-leading manageability and security for business, including the first and only hardware-based ransomware detector with Intel Threat Detection. The strength of our client road map continues with Raptor Lake, where we are shipping both desktop and mobile samples to our customers today, and we plan to follow that with Meteor Lake in 2023.\nIn data center, DCAI had strong year-on-year growth as customers continue to choose Intel. And as we continue to deliver increasing value and innovation, we are seeing strength in both hyperscaler and enterprise, and we expect the market to grow double digits going forward, driven by workloads like AI and security. Here, too, we are seeing ecosystem supply constraints, particularly in Ethernet that have limited end system shipments, which we expect to be a headwind through the year. Our third-generation Intel Scalable processor Ice Lake has now shipped almost 4 million units, and Amazon Web Services recently announced general availability of its EC2 I4i Instance designed for storage and I/O intensive workloads. This is the 48th AWS Instance powered by Ice Lake.\nI am also pleased to say that as committed, we began shipping initial SKUs of our fourth gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Sapphire Rapids, to select customers in Q1. These are the first of many SKUs for Sapphire Rapids with more due to ramp throughout the remainder of the year. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map using performance and efficient cores delivered in a common platform, maximizing customer investments and on the cadence they prefer. Our first-generation E-core Xeon will be Sierra Forest, which is designed to maximize performance per watt, providing high-density, ultraefficient compute for the cloud.\nFor workloads that benefit from high performance per core and low latency like AI, we have our redefined Granite Rapids on Intel 3 with a new and improved P core. The strength of Intel Agilex and Stratix 10 FPGAs generated record revenue as we continue to win designs and ramp into key markets. Intel FPGA-based IPUs are deployed in volume at 5 of the top 6 cloud service providers, and we continue to win designs with comm service providers utilizing Intel's latest generation FPGAs and eASICs.\nOur launch of the Habana Gaudi-based AWS EC2 DL1 Instance has shown end customers how they can reduce training costs by as much as 40% versus GPU-based instances. One of the early customers, Mobileye, is now using DL1 for training their object detection models. Gaudi 2 is already sampling the customers and demonstrating leadership performance versus competitive GPUs on multiple workloads. Finally, we continue to build our extensive data center software capabilities and recently announced the acquisition of Granulate. Granulate is a SaaS service that improves performance in cloud costs with its autonomous dynamic optimization service to unmodified customer workloads.\nThe network and edge market continues to be strong with the transformation from proprietary fixed-function devices to fully programmable, software-defined infrastructure. Our Network and Edge Group is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this transition and had record revenue in Q1.\nAt Mobile World Congress, NEX launched our newest Xeon D processor, built specifically for software-defined infrastructure across the network and edge. Our latest Xeon D has more than 70 leading companies working on designs, including Cisco, Juniper Networks and Rakuten Symphony. We believe that in the network, O-RAN and vRAN have reached a tipping point as the preferred model of all future network deployments. Nearly all commercial deployments running today are using Xeon and our FlexRAN software. We have more than 10 engagements with major global operators that we expect to be in high-volume commercial deployment within the next 2 years.\nWe also launched a new version of our OpenVINO software toolkit, with downloads growing 70% year-over-year. Built on the foundation of one API, OpenVINO has enabled hundreds of thousands of developers to dramatically accelerate performance on rapidly growing AI workloads at the edge, including Zeblok Computational who is using OpenVINO to deliver their Ai-MicroCloud solution to cities everywhere.\nGoing forward, the scale out of 5G, the explosion of AI inferencing and the growth of low latency workloads will further drive the need for compute at the edge. They will eventually begin to shift compute from the cloud, making the edge the next wave of semiconductor growth. With a broad portfolio of hardware, software and deep ecosystem partnerships, NEX remains positioned to lead the transformation across the network and to win the edge.\nMoving to our emerging businesses. Our accelerated computing systems and graphics group builds on our installed base of CPUs, IP and software and leverages a thriving open ecosystem to disrupt a large and growing market. In Q1, AXG had strong growth and celebrated a major milestone with the official launch of the Intel Arc A-Series portfolio for laptops. Alchemist, the first of these products, has been shipping to customers since early Q1 with designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others.\nThe A-Series enables up to a 2x performance improvement in graphics versus integrated graphics and incorporates Intel Deep Link technology, which utilizes Intel integrated graphics to increase application performance by up to 30%. The first laptops with Intel Arc 3 GPUs are available now. These will be followed by even more powerful designs with Intel Arc 5 and Intel Arc 7, along with desktop and workstation offerings later this year.\nIn the data center, our flagship Ponte Vecchio GPU for high-performance computing and AI is sampling to customers. Ponte Vecchio, along with Sapphire Rapids with high-bandwidth memory, will power the 2 exaFLOP Aurora Supercomputer at Oregon National Laboratory. In addition, Arctic Sound, our general purpose data center GPU designed for industry-leading media graphics and AI inference capabilities, will be available in the second half of the year.\nFinally, in Q1, we announced our intent to contribute to the development of blockchain technologies. Intel will help advance this technology in a responsible and sustainable way by developing energy-efficient computing technologies at scale. Blockscale, our first blockchain accelerator, is sampling today and will ship in production later this year. AXG remains on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year.\nOur Intel foundry services hit a $1 billion run rate for the first time as we continue to make progress towards being the trusted provider of foundry services. Our overall customer pipeline remains robust, and we now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages of engagement across our process and package offerings that collectively represent a deal value of greater than $5 billion. We have over 30 test chips committed to Intel 16 this year, and we expect the first Intel 3 and Intel 18A customer test chips to tape out in the second half of 2022. Our work with our 5 target anchor customers is progressing well. We expect additional updates later this year.\nFinally, we have seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for our acquisition of Tower. Tower shareholders recently approved the proposed acquisition. We have completed regulatory review in 2 jurisdictions outside the U.S. and hope to close the transaction as soon as possible. Building on its market leadership in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye Advanced system launches have continued, including the next-generation BMW 7 Series with the leading-edge combination of iQ5 and an 8-megapixel camera as well as BMW Highway Assistant, which enables hands-free driving on separated roadways up to 80 miles per hour.\nWe also added Miami and Stuttgart to our global AV testing program, bringing the total number of places where we have tested AVs to 10 cities in 6 countries across 3 continents. Additionally, we recently showcased Mobileye's Level 4 self-driving system in action for the first time with a robotaxi navigating the streets of Jerusalem. Mobileye expects to launch its commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv by the end of 2022.\nAnd finally, we remain committed to unlocking shareholder value and are working on our plans to take Mobileye public in 2022. In March, we announced that we confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the SEC. The IPO is proceeding smoothly, and we continue to make good progress as we work with the SEC to refine our Form S-1.\nBefore turning it over to Dave, I wanted to close with a few thoughts. First, I look forward to hosting our customers, partners and analysts at our Intel Vision event in Dallas on May 10 and 11. This will be our second Intel ON series event dedicated to the future of business and technology.\nNext, as I said at our Investor Day, we believe we have a tremendous growth story over the next several years. We're investing in innovation and embracing an open approach to compute platforms and manufacturing. We continue to add to our incredible pool of technical talent. And of course, we remain intensely focused on rebuilding our execution machine.\nFinally, we'll continue to highlight our progress in key operational milestones as we manage within the financial framework we laid out in February. I know I speak for over 120,000 Intel employees when I say that while we have work to do, our best days are ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zinsner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a solid quarter, exceeding revenue, gross margin percentage and EPS guidance despite continued ecosystem supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty. 3 of our 6 newly formed business segments, NEX, Mobileye and IFS, achieved record quarterly revenue.\nRevenue was $18.4 billion, slightly exceeding our guidance, led primarily by broad-based strength in our NEX business. Gross margin for the quarter was 53%, exceeding our guidance by 100 basis points on improved manufacturing yields and lower factory costs. EPS was $0.87, $0.07 above our guide on higher gross profit and slightly lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $5.9 billion, and we received an additional $4.6 billion from the McAfee equity sale. Total cash and investments increased by $9.7 billion in the quarter to $39 billion, driven by the NAND divestiture and McAfee sale. CapEx for the quarter was $4.6 billion.\nNow turning to our newly formed business unit results. CCG revenue was $9.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year on ramp down of the Apple CPU and modem business, the expected OEM inventory burn we cited in our Q4 call as well as lower consumer and education demand. CPU ASPs were up greater than 25% year-over-year on richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments. Operating profit was down 34% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map.\nDCAI revenue was $6 billion, up 22% year-over-year on strong Xeon demand from both our hyperscale and enterprise customers. DCAI operating profit was flat year-over-year as increased revenue was offset by increased 10-nanometer mix, factory start-up charges and increased investments in our technology and product road map.\nNEX achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $2.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year on broad-based strength across the cloud, networking and niche product lines. Operating profit was $366 million, up 51% year-over-year on higher revenue, offset by increased investments. Mobileye achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $394 million, up 11% sequentially and 5% in comparison to Q1 '21, which saw exceptionally strong auto production and pipeline rebuilding due to COVID-related recovery last year. Operating profit was $148 million, down 13% year-over-year on increased investment in next-generation products.\nAXG revenue was $219 million, up 21% year-over-year on the ramp of its supercompute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. Operating loss was $390 million versus an operating loss of $176 million in Q1 '21, with the increase driven by new product qualification reserves on our Alchemist and Arctic Sound products, production ramp charges and increased investment.\nIFS revenue was $283 million, up 175% year-over-year on increased IMF tool shipments, increased automotive demand and initial revenue from Amazon and Cisco. Operating loss was $31 million, roughly flat year-over-year as revenue and gross margin increases were offset by increased investments to build out the custom foundry business.\nMoving to our full year and Q2 guidance. As Pat mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong end user demand for our products across each of our business units and we reaffirm our revenue guidance of $76 billion, as lower than previously expected PC revenue is offset by NEX growth and DCAI hyperscale customer strength. More specifically, in our PC business, we continue to see strong commercial demand, offset by low-end consumer and education softness and the impact of no longer shipping to customers in Russia and Belarus. Further, component supply constraints continue to be a challenge with the most recent COVID lockdowns in Shanghai, further increasing supply chain risks and contributing to inflationary pressures that are having a negative impact on PC TAM for the year.\nAs a result, we're seeing OEMs continue to lower inventory levels to better match demand and align with other system components. We expect elements of this inventory burn to continue in Q2, subsiding in the second half of the year. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year as a return to normal seasonality boost demand, OEM inventory burn subsides and the ramp of our leadership Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products position us to compete per share.\nFor DCAI, we also expect to see a stronger second half of the year as hyperscale customer demand remains robust, component supply improves and the ramp of Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids increased competitiveness. For NEX, we expect the strength we saw in Q1 to continue with growth throughout the year, fueled by improving component supply, continued 5G ramp and transformation at the edge. For AXG, we continue to expect full year revenue greater than $1 billion, driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound-M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. Finally, we expect to see second half growth in each of our 2 remaining businesses, Mobileye and IFS, as they ramp new products and secure new customers.\nFor gross margin, we're guiding 52%, in line with the 51% to 53% range previously communicated. Note that the inflationary environment creates a headwind that we are continuing to monitor, but we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the impact through continued cost reduction programs as well as increased pricing in certain segments of the business. For EPS, we're guiding $3.60, $0.10 higher than prior guide on the Q1 beat and a slightly improved tax rate of 12%. Finally, net CapEx guidance of $27 billion and moderately negative adjusted free cash flow for the year remain unchanged. We have made significant progress on our smart capital initiatives, and we'll continue to manage within the framework communicated at Investor Day.\nMoving to Q2 guidance. For revenue, we're guiding $18 billion, down 2% sequentially on the short-term headwinds detailed earlier and the impact of an additional 14th week in Q1. For the lockdowns in Shanghai, we're estimating the impact to be relatively contained under the assumption that these restrictions are nearing an end. Even under a short lockdown, we anticipate it will take some time for the supply chain to normalize. And if the lockdowns persist or spread beyond Shanghai, we could see more material impacts to our outlook.\nFor gross margin, we're guiding 51%, down approximately 200 basis points sequentially on increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and Raptor Lake prequalification reserves. We had always expected Q2 gross margin to be at the low end of our range and with our full year guide of 52%, we expect gross margin to inflect upward in the second half of the year as revenue increases and inventory reserve sell-through. Finally, we're guiding a tax rate of 12% and EPS of $0.70, down $0.17 sequentially on lower gross profit and higher OpEx.\nWith that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.",

The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include both the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.\nIn today's call, we will be discussing both the Q4 2021 and the full year 2021 results, providing forward-looking guidance for Q1 '22. We will be providing guidance for full year '22 at our Investor Day on February 17. With that, let me hand it over to Pat.\n\nPatrick P. Gelsinger\n\nCEO & Director, Intel Corporation\n\nThank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me say welcome to Dave, who is joining us for his first earnings call. Many of you know Dave well and know his track record of successfully driving shareholder value. We're very excited to have him join our team. I also want to take a moment to thank George for his many contributions during the critical period in the company's transformation. Everyone here at Intel wishes him all the best in his future endeavors as he begins his planned retirement in May.\nQ4 was a tremendous finish to a transformational year where we beat expectations on both the top and bottom line. We exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $1 billion on the top line, finishing with our best quarter and our best full year revenue ever. We had a record quarter for DCG, where we grew 20% year-on-year and where we continue to be the partner of choice for cloud and data center customers. We expect that our Xeon shipments in December alone exceeded the total server CPU shipments by any single competitor for all of 2021.\nWe had a record year for our client business. And in Q4, we outperformed our plan and delivered another $10 billion quarter, highlighting again that the PC is more essential than ever. Continuing our momentum as the market leader in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye grew more than 40% year-on-year in 2021, delivering a 14th consecutive year of revenue growth. And finally, IOTG had another $1 billion quarter to cap a record year as the need for compute at the edge continues to grow.\nSupporting these record results, our manufacturing network continued its superb execution throughout the year. As an IDM, we were able to rapidly adjust to support customers' mix changes, often with a normal lead time, and manufactured more than 2 million wafers. We broke ground on 2 new fabs in Arizona 3 months ahead of schedule as part of the largest overall manufacturing expansion in Intel's history and all while managing a challenging COVID environment and focusing on the safety of our employees, suppliers and partners.\nWe also took several in a series of key steps to shape our business. To begin with, we've recently completed the first close of the sale of our NAND business on time, a critical step in optimizing our portfolio in line with our new strategy. Second, we began unfolding our plan to find innovative ways to sustainably unlock shareholder value with the announcement of our intent to take Mobileye public in 2022. Third, just last week, we announced our new manufacturing site in Ohio, which will support our future growth and advances our plan to create a more geographically balanced, resilient supply chain. While there is a lot left to do, we're building momentum, and we intend to continue our laser focus on execution, innovation and growing the business.\nFinally, Q4 was a sacred moment for the entire technology industry as we led the 50th anniversary celebration of the Intel 4004, the chip that changed the world. Microprocessor technology sparked by the Intel 4004 allows us to stay connected during the pandemic. It has opened up new ways to work and learn. It has removed geographical boundaries and changed almost every aspect of our lives. We are committed to accelerate this impact for the next 50 years as the insatiable need for compute that started with the 4004 continues to drive the value of Moore's Law. At IDM, we outlined a long-term path toward more than 10x density improvement in packaging and a 30% to 50% area improvement in transistor scaling. As the steward of Moore's Law, we remain committed to keeping it alive for the next decade and beyond.\nLooking across the industry, 2021 was dominated by 2 recurring themes, unprecedented demand and ecosystem supply constraints. The strong demand we saw throughout 2021 continued in Q4, and markets remained robust across all our businesses. We expect this trend to continue as the digitization of everything, driven by the 4 superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute and cloud-to-edge infrastructure leads to an era of sustainable growth. 2021 marked the best year in a decade for the PC industry, with third parties reporting a growth rate of approximately 15%, driven by higher PC density, shorter replacement cycles and increased market penetration. In Q4, we also saw the strong recovery in the channel as increased supply led to a record sell-through for Intel, and we started to see inventories return to prepandemic levels. The data center market was strong across all geographies in Q4, led by the enterprise where the market continued to recover from COVID lows. We expect the data center, network and edge markets to continue to have robust growth as hyperscalers lay out multiyear cloud CapEx investment plans. The ongoing need for data privacy and security drives additional edge and on-prem deployments. 5G network and edge build-outs are scaling and workloads like AI continue to expand. This unprecedented demand continues to be tempered by supply chain constraints as shortages in substrates, components and foundry silicon has limited our customers' ability to ship finished systems. Across the industry, this was most acutely felt in the client market, particularly in notebooks, but constraints have widely impacted other markets, including automotive, the Internet of Things and the data center.\nAs we predicted, these ecosystem constraints are expected to persist through 2022 and into 2023, with incremental improvements over this period. The industry will continue to see challenges in a variety of areas, including specialty and overall foundry shortages, substrates as well as third-party silicon. While constraints will remain, our IDM 2.0 strategy affords us a superior position to navigate this environment. With control over our manufacturing network and supply chain, we are able to react to rapid changes in demand that help solve challenges for our customers, suppliers and partners. Equally important as an IDM, we remain more resilient to foundry price increases as only a minority of our volume is produced by third parties.\nTurning from the ecosystem to Intel. We made incredible progress over the last year improving our execution in technology development, manufacturing and product leadership. With unprecedented transparency, we laid out an ambitious path to deliver 5 process nodes in 4 years and regain process performance parity by 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025. We are shipping Intel 7 in volume today. And as I was able to say last quarter and can reaffirm today, we remain on or ahead of schedule for Intel 4, 3, 20A and 18A against the time lines we laid out in July.\nOur manufacturing execution continued to improve. And in Q4, as we ship a record number of servers and we have more than a 30% year-on-year reduction in 10-nanometer wafer costs, we had record quarterly increase in our substrate capacity with our vendors, and we accelerated our pace of innovation with a record number of PDK releases and new product introductions in our factories. Finally, as part of our strategy to use both internal and external manufacturing, we signed multiple long-term supply agreements ranging from foundry partners to substrates to equipment suppliers that will support the growth of our business for years to come. In particular, we announced the deepening of our ASML partnership and our leadership position with the second generation of EUV High-NA.\nIn client, we had another $10 billion quarter, and 2021 was our sixth straight year of revenue growth. We feel great about our position within the sustainably larger client market, and we had an all-time record shipments with customers like Dell. We have a great product lineup starting with Tiger Lake, which has now shipped over 100 million units, making it the fastest-ramping notebook in our history. We are extending our leadership position further with products like our 12th generation Alder Lake, the fastest client processor ever, which is now shipping to over 140 customers in 30 countries around the world. As our first performance hybrid product, it features the highest-performance CPU core Intel has ever built as well as the efficient cores optimized for power. It leads the industry transition on DDR5 and PCIe 5 to enhance gaming and creator experiences. The Alder Lake family will scale across every PC segment from ultra thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktops, where we've now set new overclocking records to mobile gaming, where the Core i9-12900HK, the world's best mobile gaming processor, is up to 40% faster than the prior generation. Following on the success of Alder Lake, we will continue to build momentum later this year when we expect to introduce Raptor Lake, which is already booted in our labs.\nIn addition to leadership products, we are also driving platform innovations. And at CES, we unveiled our third-gen Evo platform. This new generation includes features like intelligent collaboration to optimize remote work and learning experiences as well as Thunderbolt 4 and WiFi 6E. With no legacy WiFi interference, WiFi 6E will enable incredible performance with low latency, the biggest WiFi advancement in 20 years. We are further reinvigorating the PC ecosystem with technologies like Screenovate, which provides a seamless multi-device and screen-sharing experience, which will begin rolling out on select Intel Evo platforms starting later this year. Driven by the strong product and platform lineup, we feel confident in our ability to compete and drive growth going forward.\nOur Data Center Group had its best quarter ever as customers continued rebuilding their confidence in choosing Intel. Enabled by our IDM advantage, Ice Lake servers shipped more than 1 million units, equal to the amount we had shipped in the prior 3 quarters combined. All of our OEMs are currently shipping systems, and all of our major cloud customers have announced instances, including our third instance with Amazon Web Services. Going forward, our road map only gets better, and we expect to ship initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers in Q1. Sapphire Rapids will offer significant performance improvements across a range of workloads, including AI, where we are targeting up to 30x total gain for Xeon. This demonstrates that a general-purpose CPU with built-in AI acceleration can solve even more customer use cases that once necessitated GPU acceleration. Customers remain excited about Sapphire Rapids, and it has been chosen, along with HPE, to power the new Kestrel supercomputer. Built for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Kestrel will accelerate discovery of renewable power. Once completed in 2023, Kestrel will have more than 5x greater capability than NREL's existing system with approximately 44 petaflops of peak performance.\nBeyond the core data center, we continue to build on our leadership position from the network to the edge with our comprehensive portfolio of hardware and software solutions. We are leading the transformation of the network where Xeon and FlexRAN software are used in almost all DRAM commercial deployments. We are driving AI inferencing adoption at the edge with our OpenVINO software and partners like BMW Group and Samsung in the factory and medical environments. And we are extending the IPU ecosystem and accelerating the creation of fully programmable network by collaborating on new FPGA-based IPU solutions with Inspur, Ruijie Networks and Silicom.\nIn our discrete and accelerated graphics business, we are starting the year very quickly. Alchemist, the first product in our Intel Arc Discrete Graphics lineup, is now shipping to customers with more than 50 new mobile and desktop designs, including with Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others. Our Arc family of products will scale from mainstream up to the performance graphics segment and will be available in the market later this quarter.\nIn high-performance computing, our Ponte Vecchio GPU is already sampling to customers. With 100 billion transistors, Ponte Vecchio has our highest compute density ever and along with Sapphire Rapids will power the 2 exaflop Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. There are over 100 HPC applications running on Ponte Vecchio, which, enabled by 1 API, provides a unified and open programming model across CPU and GPU. We are working with numerous partners and customers, including Atos, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Quanta and Super Micro to deploy our HPC-tuned CPUs and GPUs in their latest systems.\nOur IFS business continues to see strong and enthusiastic customer support. We have a strong pipeline of potential customers, and IP development with the ecosystem is progressing well. We are shipping for revenue on our packaging solutions, and we continue to expect customer test chips in our factories on our Intel 16 process this year. Innovations like RibbonFET and PowerVia are proving to be very attractive features to potential customers, and the Intel 18A design kit has now been released to 3 RAMP-C customers. Overall, we are ahead of where I thought we'd be, and I am thrilled with the progress of our IFS team.\nIn mobility, Mobileye continues to be an industry leader in both ADAS and AV, and we recently hit a significant milestone shipping our 100th million EyeQ SoC. At CES, we gave a glimpse of the future with the EyeQ Ultra, which will do the work of 10 EyeQ 5 SoCs in a single package and was designed to deliver the optimum power and performance for a fully self-driving vehicle. In Q4, we also introduced our first autonomous on-demand service in Paris in collaboration with the RATP Group. Paris is the latest in a list of locations where Mobileye is piloting autonomous vehicle test fleets, including New York, Munich, Detroit, Tokyo, Israel and China. Looking ahead, we still expect to launch commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022.\nAs we announced in December, we are working to take Mobileye public to unlock shareholder value. We are making good progress, and we'll share more as we go through the year. You'll hear a lot more about how we are rearchitecting our business for growth as part of our upcoming Investor Day. We will lay out details on how we are leveraging our core strengths to accelerate our plans and how we are uniquely positioned to create value. We'll give you the proof points you should expect to see in 2022 that show that we are on track for our long-term plan, all backed up by the transparency and accountability that our new reportable segments will provide.\nLet me close by saying again that Q4 was an incredibly strong finish to a great 2021. And I believe that, with growing markets, our strong product road map and our increasingly solid execution, 2022 will only be better. In fact, just in the past 24 hours, we were pleased to see the ruling from the general court in Europe and their decision to overturn the EUR 1.1 billion fine. The semiconductor industry has never been more competitive than it is today, and we look forward to continuing to invest and grow in Europe. At the same time, here in the U.S., we were very excited to see the progress on the Chips Act with the House introducing their version of the bill yesterday. The President and other members of the administration have been clear on the importance of this transformational investment, and it's encouraging to see the strong bipartisan and bicameral support as we continue to work together to address the long-term impacts of the semiconductor shortage, restore U.S. leadership in this critical industry and rebalance the global supply chain.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zinsner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me say how happy I am to be part of Intel. It's a really exciting time, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to support Intel's transformation and plans for growth. I think we have a great opportunity to drive compelling returns and shareholder value, which all starts with the plans that we will lay out for you at Investor Day in February.\nQ4 was a record quarter, delivering a stronger-than-expected finish to another record year. Both DCG and IOTG achieved record quarters, with CCG, IOTG and Mobileye delivering full year record revenue. Q4 revenue was $19.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion. The revenue beat was broad-based, led by stronger-than-expected enterprise and government demand in data center, desktop PC strength and better-than-expected notebook demand.\nGross margin for the quarter was 55.4%, exceeding our guidance by 190 basis points due to strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q4 EPS was $1.09, $0.19 above our guide due to strong operational performance. For full year 2021, we achieved record revenue of $74.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from our previous guidance and up 2% year-over-year. 2021 gross margin was 57.7%, and EPS was $5.47, up $0.37 year-over-year. We generated $11.3 billion of free cash flow in 2021, approximately $1 billion lower than prior expectations as higher net income was offset by Q4 working capital fluctuations.\nNow turning to our business units. CCG delivered record annual revenue, its sixth straight year of revenue growth, up 1% year-over-year and up 6% when excluding the modem and connected home divestitures. For the quarter, revenue was $10.1 billion, up 5% sequentially on strong commercial demand. Platform ASPs were up 15% year-over-year on a richer mix, driven by strong demand for our highest-performing platforms and industry-wide constraints leading our customers to prioritize limited components to higher-end systems. Operating profit was down 3% year-over-year on increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map.\nThe Data Center Group delivered a record $7.3 billion in revenue for Q4, up 12% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year on strong enterprise and government demand. Full year revenue was down 1% due to a slower-than-expected recovery earlier in the year as well as competitive pressure, partially offset by stronger enterprise and government and communications service provider demand. Platform ASPs were up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year on improved mix to our highest-performing products. Operating profit in Q4 was down 17% year-over-year, primarily due to the previously disclosed Intel federal-related onetime charge and 10-nanometer product ramp. Full year operating profit was down due to lower revenue, with an increased mix of 10-nanometer products, Intel 4 start-up charges and increased investment in our product road map.\nIOTG achieved record Q4 and full year revenue. Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 36% year-over-year on broad-based strength, led by the industrial and retail segments. Full year revenue was $4 billion, up 33% year-over-year as the business saw a strong recovery from COVID-related impacts. Operating profit for the year was $1 billion, up 110% year-over-year.\nPSG delivered $484 million in Q4 revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up slightly quarter-over-quarter as industry-wide supply constraints continue to severely limit revenue growth. Full year revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Operating profit was $51 million, up 19% year-over-year. If not for the external supply constraints, we believe the PSG business would have delivered over $500 million in additional revenue in 2021.\nMobileye reported Q4 revenue of $356 million and $1.4 billion for full year, up 43% year-over-year. Full year operating profit was $460 million, up 91% year-over-year.\nBefore moving on to Q1 guidance, I want to briefly discuss changes to our non-GAAP reporting beginning in 2022 that we touched on in our Q3 earnings. First, in an effort to more closely align with our semiconductor peers and allow for more consistent comparability between periods, we'll be removing stock-based compensation and all gains and losses related to our ICAP portfolio from our non-GAAP results. Despite this change, we'll continue to closely evaluate stock-based compensation to ensure we're in line with industry benchmarks and optimize ICAP investments to advance our strategy and maximize ROI. Second, we're modifying our segment reporting to align with our revised organizational structure and business strategy. Moving forward, we will report results under the following business units: Client Computing, which includes our historical CCG business plus workstation revenue; Data Center and Artificial Intelligence, which includes our data center CPU products plus our PSG business; Networking and Edge, which includes our IOTG business plus our networking-focused products previously included in DCG; Accelerated Computing and Graphics, which includes all discrete graphics products; Mobileye, which is unchanged from our prior segmentation; and Intel Foundry Services, which includes revenue from our wafer and packaging offerings. This new reporting structure enables transparent accountability relative to how well we are managing and executing against the 6 business units that will be further communicated at Investor Day in February.\nMoving to our Q1 outlook. We continue to see strong demand across all our businesses, and note that Q1 includes the impact of an additional 14th week. We expect results to be tempered by continued industry-wide component constraints, normal seasonality and PC notebook inventory burn as OEMs work through inventory imbalances created by ecosystem constraints that have limited their ability to ship systems in certain segments. We expect Q1 revenue of $18.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but up 2% when adjusting for an approximately $600 million onetime corporate revenue item recognized in Q1 '21. As we signaled in our Q3 call, gross margin will be impacted by our 10-nanometer product ramp and increased process technology investment. The aforementioned onetime corporate revenue item in Q1 '21 will also impact the year-on-year compare. We are forecasting gross margin of 52%, EPS of approximately $0.80 and a tax rate of approximately 15%. Note that we will provide full year 2022 guidance and more details on our long-term financial model as part of our Investor Day on February 17. We hope to see you there in person for a full day of presentations and Q&A sessions with our most senior leaders.\nFinally, I want to thank George for his 3 years at Intel, delivering outstanding results and making many of the changes necessary to begin our transition to a growth company.\nAnd now let me hand it off to George to say a few words.\n\nGeorge S. Davis\n\nExecutive Adviser, Intel Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave. I want to close my final earnings call with sincere thanks to our Intel employees who amaze me every day and for the privilege to have served as your CFO. And I could not be more delighted that Dave is taking over, knowing all the incredible strengths he brings to the role. Thanks all.\n\nDavid A. Zinsner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, George. With that, let me turn the call back over to Tony to get to your questions.\n\nTony Balow\n\nSenior Director of IR, Intel Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, Dave. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.",

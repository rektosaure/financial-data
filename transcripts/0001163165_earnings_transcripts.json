My name is Liz, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During the question-and-answer session, if you have a question, please press star one-one on your touch-tone phone. I will now turn the call over to Guy Baber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nGuy Baber\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Liz, and welcome everyone to our Q3 2025 earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Andy O'Brien, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Strategy and Commercial; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48 and Global HSE; and Kirk Johnson, Executive Vice President of Global Operations and Technical Functions. Ryan and Andy will kick off the call with opening remarks today, after which the team will be available for your questions. For Q&A, we will be taking one question per caller. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we publish supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the Investor Relations website. Second, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\nActual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. We'll make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Guy, and thank you to everyone for joining our third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. We have a lot to cover today, including our third quarter results, improved 2025 outlook, strategic updates, and our preliminary 2026 guidance. Now, starting with our third quarter results, this was another very strong execution quarter. We again exceeded the top end of our production guidance, demonstrating the power of our diversified portfolio, with both capital spending and operating costs declining quarter on quarter. On the back of this strong performance, we raised our full-year production guidance, and we have reduced our adjusted operating cost guidance for the second time this year. In fact, we have improved all our major guidance drivers since the beginning of 2025: CapEx, operating cost, and production, further demonstrating the strength of our team's execution.\nOn return of capital, we raised our base dividend by 8%, consistent with our goal to deliver top quartile dividend growth relative to the S&P 500. This type of dividend growth is sustainable, given the strength of our outlook and expectation for our free cash flow break-even to decline into the low 30s WTI by the end of the decade. Year to date, we've returned about 45% of our CFO to shareholders, in line with our full-year guidance and our longer-term track record. Turning to our strategic updates, at the Willow Project in Alaska, after completing our largest winter construction season and conducting a comprehensive project review, we've increased our project capital estimate to $8.5 to $9 billion. This change is primarily attributable to higher-than-expected general inflation and localized North Slope cost escalation.\nDespite cost pressures, we have maintained the project schedule and made excellent progress on scope execution, narrowing first oil to early 2029. We also continue to advance our global LNG projects, another key driver of our expected free cash flow inflection. We have reduced total LNG project capital by $600 million. Our three equity projects, NFE, NFS, and Qatar, and Phase One at Port Arthur LNG, are on track and have been substantially de-risked. Capital spending is now about 80% complete, with our first startup expected next year at NFE. Looking ahead to 2026, recognizing it's early, the macro remains volatile, and that our portfolio is highly flexible, our preliminary guidance for both CapEx and OpEx is to be improved significantly, down about $1 billion on a combined basis from this year. And in fact, relative to our pro forma 2024, they are down about $3 billion.\nUnderlying production should be flat to up next year, a reasonable starting point given the current macro environment. Looking beyond just the near term, ConocoPhillips continues to offer a compelling value proposition to the market, one that is differentiated relative to our sector and to the broader S&P 500. We believe we have the highest quality asset base in our peer space. Our global portfolio is deep, durable, and diverse, with the most advantaged US inventory position in the sector. We are uniquely investing in our portfolio and driving significant efficiencies throughout the organization to deliver improving returns on and of capital and a leading multi-year free cash flow growth profile.\nConsistent with our guidance last quarter, we continue to expect the four major projects we are progressing, along with our recently announced cost reduction and margin enhancement efforts, to drive a $7 billion free cash flow inflection by 2029, potentially doubling the consensus expectation for free cash flow this year. That free cash flow inflection is now underway. We expect to realize about $1 billion annually through 2026 through 2028, before an additional $4 billion in 2029 once Willow comes online. That's a growth trajectory that's unmatched in our sector. So bottom line, we're performing well, we're delivering on our plan, and we're well positioned for 2026 and beyond. Now with that, let me turn the call over to Andy to cover our third quarter performance, major project updates, and 2026 guidance in more detail.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. Starting with our Q3 performance, as Ryan mentioned, we had another quarter of strong execution across the portfolio. We produced 2,399,000 BOE per day, once again exceeding the high end of our production guidance. Regarding Q3 financials, we generated $1.61 per share in adjusted earnings and $5.4 billion of CFO. Capital expenditures were $2.9 billion, down quarter on quarter as we passed the peak of our major project capital investment cycle. We returned over $2.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.3 billion in buybacks and $1 billion in ordinary dividends. Through the Q3, we've now returned $7 billion to our shareholders, or about 45% of our CFO, consistent with our full-year guidance and our long-term track record. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.6 billion, plus $1.1 billion in long-term liquid investments.\nTurning to our outlook for 2025, we've raised our full-year production guidance to 2,375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 15,000 from our prior guidance midpoint. This is even after considering Anadarko's sale of approximately 40,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent, which closed on 1 October. We're reducing our operating cost guidance to $10.6 billion, down from the prior guidance midpoint of $10.8 billion, and our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $11 billion. We're also making great progress on our asset sales program, with another half a billion dollars on top of what we announced last quarter. That takes us up to over $3 billion of asset sales out of our $5 billion target. Of this amount, $1.6 billion was closed and the cash was received through Q3, and we have another $1.5 billion that will have closed in Q4.\nThat includes the remainder of the Anadarko disposition proceeds, as well as additional non-core Lower 48 assets. Turning now to our strategic updates, at Willow, we've updated our total project capital estimate to $8.5 to $9 billion. After successfully completing peak winter season, we undertook a detailed bottom-up reforecast of the project, and as a result, have increased our cost estimate. The increase is primarily due to higher general labor and equipment inflation and increased inflation on North Slope construction. Scope execution has remained strong. We're nearing 50% project completion. This has allowed us to narrow our estimate of initial production to early 2029. Importantly, we can now level load the pace of our future work. More specifically, 2025 Willow project capital is forecast to be just north of $2 billion. We plan to reduce capital to around $1.7 billion a year from 2026 through 2028.\nAfter achieving first oil, ongoing development capital will decline to about $0.5 billion a year for several years. We continue to expect Willow to deliver $4 billion of free cash flow inflection in 2029, consistent with our prior commentary. Turning to our three LNG projects, NFE and NFS in Qatar, and Port Arthur LNG Phase One, we are reducing our total project capital estimate from $4 billion to $3.4 billion. This reduction is due to a $600 million credit from Port Arthur Phase Two. The credit is for shared infrastructure costs previously incurred by Phase One equity holders. As a reminder, we only have equity in Phase One, not Phase Two. With this credit, we're approximately 80% complete with our total project capital for these three LNG projects.\nApproximately $800 million of project capital remains, averaging just north of $250 million of spend annually, with a declining trend from 2026 to 2028. All projects remain on track. We continue to expect first LNG from NFE in 2026, Port Arthur in 2027, and NFS after that. We're also making considerable progress in advancing our commercial LNG strategy, which will further strengthen our long-term free cash flow generation capacity. As a reminder, our strategy is to connect low-cost supply North American natural gas to higher value international markets. We are leveraging our decades of LNG experience at our global scale to advance our strategy, which nicely complements our more than two BCF a day or 15 MTPA equivalent of Henry Hub-linked US natural gas production. We have fully placed the first five MTPA from Port Arthur Phase One with combined re-gas and sales agreements into Europe and Asia.\nIn terms of offtake, we've recently agreed to take four MTPA from Port Arthur Phase Two and one MTPA from Rio Grande LNG, bringing our total offtake portfolio to about 10 MTPA, the lower end of our stated 10 to 15 MTPA ambition. Now turning to our outlook for 2026, we are providing a high-level framework, assuming about a $60 a barrel WTI price environment. First, we continue to expect a significant reduction to our capital spend next year, about half a billion dollars lower than the midpoint of our 2025 guidance. So in round numbers, that's about $12 billion for 2026. The year-on-year decline is driven by a reduction in our major project spend, including Willow, and the steady-state activity we achieved on the Lower 48 Marathon Oil assets earlier this year. In addition to lowering our capital spend in 2026, we also expect to lower our operating costs.\nThis is largely due to the $1 billion of cost reduction and margin enhancement efforts we disclosed last quarter. We expect our cost in 2026 to be approximately $10.2 billion, down $400 million from our current year guidance, and down $1 billion from our pro forma 2024 operating costs, including Marathon Oil. Turning to our production, we expect to deliver flat to 2% underlying growth in 2026, a reasonable planning assumption considering the ongoing macro volatility. Additional guidance can be found in our earnings material, including our oil mix and our equity affiliate distributions. Now addressing our multi-year outlook, there are a few important points I'd like to make. First, the free cash flow inflection guidance we previously provided remains unchanged. We expect our four in-progress major projects and our $1 billion cost reduction and margin enhancement efforts to deliver $7 billion of free cash flow inflection by 2029.\nIn terms of the timing of that $7 billion, we expect to realize about $1 billion of improvement each year from 2026 through 2028, amounting to $3 billion of free cash flow improvement by 2028. The remaining $4 billion will come in 2029 once Willow starts up. Bottom line, using 2025 consensus as a baseline, this translates to a double-digit free cash flow growth CAGR through 2028, before another material step up in 2029, which will approximately double our 2025 free cash flow. So to wrap up, we continue to execute well, operationally, financially, and across our strategic initiatives. We are well positioned for a strong finish to the year and a good start to 2026. And we continue to find ways to enhance our differentiated long-term investment thesis. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it over to the operator to start the Q&A.Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have a question, please press star 11 on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star 11 again. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star 11 on your touch-tone phone. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, good morning, Ryan, Andy, team. Appreciate the time here. I want to unpack Willow a bit because while there was a lot of good stuff in terms of execution in the quarter, the Willow update obviously was a little disappointing. One-year perspective on the bridging from the seven to seven and a half to eight and a half to nine, do you feel, Ryan, that we've got a good handle around the project at this point? Because the history of major capital projects sometimes is there are multiple legs of announcements around overruns. And on the bright side, it seems like while there's cost overrun here, the timing's really intact. Just unpacking slide four would be great.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thank you, Neil. Appreciate the question and certainly appreciate the project for the company. And I know giving some clarity on where we've been, where we're at today, and what that future looks like is important to provide that insight and the clarity. So I've asked Kirk to unpack this a little bit using your words, Neil, and spend a little bit of time to make sure y'all understand sort of where we're at today and where we're going in the future. So let me ask Kirk to do that and provide a lot more clarity to that.\n\nKirk Johnson\n\nEVP of Global Operations and Technical Functions, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, morning, Neil. Certainly, as you heard in our prepared remarks here this morning from Ryan and from Andy, we are increasing our guide on total project capital for the Willow project to a range of $8.5 to $9 billion. I'll start by recognizing the strong execution that we've been achieving through our project team. Certainly, as you've heard from me before, we're hitting the key milestones that we premised in our project plan that, of course, we laid out at FID back in 2023. In this past quarter, we chose to perform a pretty rigorous bottoms-up comprehensive project review. We were looking at scope, schedule, and, of course, total project costs. We were doing that in recognition that we knew we were coming in on about 50% completion, expect to see that as we move into this next winter season.\nIt's common practice for us to take on a pretty rigorous, again, bottoms-up at this place and projects of this nature and of this size. Coming out of that exercise, we were able to provide two new guides on the project, not just capital, but also on schedule. Starting with the first, the new guide on capital is a confirmation really largely of one driver, and that's that we've realized higher inflation post-FID in 2023. Addressing that maybe a little bit more detail here, total inflation is roughly 80% of the increase on our new capital guide. I'll start with general inflation, which has been modestly higher across a few key categories that we've seen on the projects: general labor, materials, and then engineering equipment as well. All of that makes up over half, and in fact, about 60% of our total project spend.\nSo, seeing that higher inflation is really culminating largely in what you're seeing in this new capital guide. As you can imagine, just a few percent higher. We originally expected just a couple percent of routine standard inflation across the period of the project, but just a couple percent higher in inflation rates across the five-year duration on a project is driving this 15% increase against what was our original expectations at FID, expecting lower inflation. And then a bit more unique to this project, we've also incurred some localized escalation, particularly in our Alaska North Slope specific markets. And that's really been driven by the fact that we've incurred more overlap of the peak construction seasons between our project and other projects ongoing in Alaska than we had originally expected. And that's resulting in roughly a 2x increase in the regional activity there in the state.\nThat's stressed the local markets, think labor, logistics such as trucking, marine, and then even the availability of camps for our construction work there on the slope. We're often asked about tariffs. We have seen some impacts on tariffs, but albeit, it's really been low single-digit percentages as a total of the increase we're seeing on that project. And then the last component on the upward cost pressure is related to a few decisions that we've made to ensure that we're mitigating total project risk and especially schedule risk, just to ensure that we're hitting the milestones that we need, especially on the front end of this project. And you've heard from me that we're hitting those. And so those have really paid well for us. We've pre-staged equipment on winter seasons to ensure that we can knock out all the scope that we had originally premised.\nAnd again, that's giving us the ability and the confidence to be able to guide you a bit more even on schedule. So to summarize, we've moved from about 50% of our contracts being locked up at FID back a couple of years ago to now being well over 90% of our facility contracts being secured. And a bulk of those are tied to market indices. That gives us transparency as the market moves and creates a lot of accountability with us and our business partners as we move through a project of this size. And so this summer, again, was the time for us to reconcile the actual inflation that we've been seeing over the last couple of years against the forward-looking expectation.\nAnd you're hearing from me, we're in essence taking forward the type of inflation that we've been realizing forward into the next couple of years just to ensure that we're being conservative through this process. So looking ahead, again, back to execution, we've wrapped up detailed engineering that compels us to keep moving forward on the process module fabrication. That's a longer duration activity. It moves from this year into early 2027, in which we'll see those modules to the slope, in 2028 getting those into the Willow development area and hooking up and commissioning those for first oil in 2029. So again, I'll wrap this up with an acknowledgment that we're just seeing really strong execution across the project. And that's foundational. It's paramount for us in a project of this kind. And we're on track with all of our major scopes of work.\nAnd again, all of this is culminating in not just a guide on capital, but then our ability to provide an accelerated guide on first oil to the early part of 2029.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nI would just wrap it up, Neil, by saying that we're certainly disappointed that the costs are higher. Sorry. Wrap up, Neil, with just saying I'm disappointed that the costs are higher, but certainly we've taken measures across our portfolio to help mitigate the increase. And I think you see that in our first. That's why we thought it was important to give some guide to 2026. But the teams are executing well, and the project's really hitting all the milestones as Kirk described. We think it continues to be a world-class project. It'll be a huge driver of our free cash flow inflection that's coming over the next three to four years and really complete us towards the end of the decade. And then the last thing I'd say is we're going out probably with a bigger exploration program we've had in Alaska in a number of years.\nIt's that opportunity again to take advantage of this infrastructure that we're building for the long-term growth and development of the company. If we're right about our macro call and where we think the macro is going, we're going to need this conventional oil to satisfy some of that growing demand around the world that we see. So it fits all of our ticks, all of our strategic buckets as well. So I know a long kind of explanation to the initial question off the bat, but we thought it was important to provide some of that clarity and context around it to give you comfort. We know where we've been. We know where we're at. We know where we're going.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nArun Jayaram\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, good morning. Ryan, I was wondering if you could just maybe a quick follow-up on Willow. The F&D on the project goes up by $2 to 250 per BOE based on your updated outlook. I was just wondering if you could comment on how this impacts your project returns and just overall break-evens, assuming call it a mid-$60 Brent type of price.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, yeah, thanks, Arun. Certainly, the estimate increase does impact the cost of supply of this individual project going forward. It still fits well within our portfolio. It's still very competitive within the portfolio. And again, we think longer term. We think about the future opportunities that are going to come from this infrastructure, which is our history sitting on the North Slope. We've always the satellite discoveries that we get benefit from the infrastructure that we built. And we fully expect that to be the case going forward with Willow. And then I'd remind you on the back end of this, the margins are still quite attractive because Alaska's 100% oil sells at a premium to Brent, typically on the West Coast of the United States.\nSo that's why even with maybe a little slightly higher F&D, as you point out, we still feel very comfortable with the margin, and it's competitive in the portfolio, and it's going to deliver a project for the company that will add to its future growth and development.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Betty Jiang from Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. I want to maybe shift focus to the Lower 48. Just, we talk a lot about the Free Cash Flow for the major capital projects, but now they're seeing that the Lower 48 CapEx is also trending lower in H2 2025 versus H1 2025. And if you're staying here, CapEx will be lower year on year in 2026 while still perhaps growing in that asset. So can you speak to the CapEx trajectory there and how do you see the Free Cash Flow progressing from the Lower 48?\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP of Lower 48 and Global HSE, ConocoPhillips\n\nYep. Yeah. Good morning, Betty. You're exactly right. Maybe I'll take you back a little bit on the capital projection and a little bit of the efficiencies that we're seeing within the Lower 48 portfolio. If you recall, back in Q2, we achieved our level loaded steady state program within the development strategy with integrating the Marathon assets. And so if you recall, we went from 34 rigs down to 24 rigs, so a pretty significant reduction. And we're still delivering kind of low single-digit growth in that. So obviously, we're taking in stock that lower capital from going first half to second half, and you're going to see that in the capital projections going forward.\nAnother key component of that, Betty, is a lot around the efficiency improvements that we've seen getting into that level loaded steady state program, which I can talk more about, but we're seeing significant improvement on drilling performance as well as our completions. That will continue into 2026. So if you kind of look at where we're currently at, we're probably going to be on a run rate basis for 2026, something similar to Q3 for capital in 2026. We will continue to have that level loaded steady state program roughly at 24 rigs in frac crews going forward. As far as free cash flow, I'd probably let Andy talk about the total company, but we continue to see expansion with, again, all the efficiency improvements that we're seeing with the productivity that you saw in Q3. Really good, strong quarter.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Yeah, Betty, Sandy, I'll just jump in and sort of add on to what Nick was saying that. So we feel it's important sort of on the free cash flow inflection to talk specifically to the three LNG projects of Willow. But of course, there's a lot more than that going on in our company. And Nick just described what we've got with Lower 48 and the flexibility we have within the Lower 48 with that inventory if we wanted to ramp up that cash flow growth. But even beyond that, there's other things that we don't factor into that free cash flow inflection. Commercial, for example, where we talked about the commercial sort of strategy, we've got Port Arthur Phase 2, and we've got Rio Grande that we just mentioned today that will come on after Willow. That's going to be sort of the 2030 timeframe.\nSo there's a lot more going on in the company than just those four projects. We've got other things going on sort of in Canada, in Alaska, and a range of other international assets. But we just wanted to keep line of sight on this specific free cash flow inflection, and then we obviously have ability to add to that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stephen Richardson from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks. Andy, it's a good segue from what you just mentioned about some of the other assets. I was wondering. It sounds like you've got some good visibility on some of the organic and capital-efficient opportunities in the portfolio. In Alaska, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the regulatory and permit changes and how you're thinking about incremental opportunities either in legacy ops or extending the resource at Willow. And then, if you could maybe talk a little bit about Surmont. You've talked about incremental steam potential, but I understand that there's some other things that you could be doing now that you've got your arms around that asset and to improve it with minimal capital. Thanks.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Steve. I'll take that. I think it's, yeah, Annie's answer to the last one. This updates a lot about Willow and some of the major projects to give the market some clarity as to what we have going on there and some clarity into our free cash flow growth. It doesn't really address and assume some of the things we have that we're studying inside the portfolio as well. You mentioned a few of those because I think we do have a strategic question longer term. If our call on the macro is right, where's the conventional oil going to come from to satisfy the growing demand? We see that demand growing clearly million barrels a day or so per year for the foreseeable future. We will look inside the portfolio.\nIt's not only what we're doing in Willow and what we believe are going to be the added sort of pads that we can develop there. And to your point, we're working with the administration to identify some ways to streamline the permitting. I think you saw an early read of that with the new rules that are coming out for development and NPRA. That's just sort of the start. There's more things coming that will give us what we think is going to be a lot more clarity to faster permitting approvals coming in Alaska going forward. So watch that space as we move on and hopefully not only make it more formidable, easier, and faster, but also more durable with changing administrations. And then to your other point, yeah, when we look, that's just Alaska. And I commend the team also managing the base.\nThere's a lot of activity going on on the base side in Alaska as well. We have flexibility at the Montney asset to ramp up should the call on crude be required to go do that. You mentioned Surmont. We're right now debottlenecking that plant as we speak. Now that we own 100% of that plant, we were able to make some investments in there that our previous partner were not approving. So we're taking the gross productive capacity of the plant up today and then looking at future. Can we add a few steam generation capacity to accelerate some of the development that we have with the huge resource that we have around Surmont that's very competitive in all at sub-$40 cost of supply?\nSo when we look at the whole portfolio and you look at the deep inventory we have in the Lower 48 combined with the other conventional opportunities we have around the world, we're really set up for decades of growth in this business. I like where we're at, and I like the portfolio and what we're doing today and the optionality that it creates for the company over the short, medium, and long term.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Ryan or Andy, I was just hoping you could spend a little bit more time on the OpEx. I mean, $400 million improvement. And in light of it kind of being the second cut this year, what's changing? Maybe remind us of the big factors that have improved and whether you can improve it further. Thanks.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Lloyd. I can take that one. I think at the highest level, the first thing I would say is that we're executing really well with our costs and capturing the savings. And as you said, that's why we've been able to reduce the guidance for the second time this year. But going into a few specifics, I would remind people that we've already achieved now 75% of the Marathon synergies that we were talking about over the prior quarters. That's in our costs. And we'll have that basically completely into our costs by the time we get sort of to the end of this year on a run rate basis. So we're exceptionally pleased with how smoothly that's gone in basically delivering on those cost reductions that we previously talked about.\nAnd then as we look to 2026 and stepping the cost down again, as you said, that's basically getting the full year benefit of some Marathon synergies that I just described. But then we expect to capture a meaningful amount of the cost improvements that we announced on the last quarter call. And that's basically going to drive some pretty meaningful reductions in our costs as we go through next year. They're kind of the key things. And when we think about sort of how we reduce costs, we have sort of a mindset that this is continuous improvement. So we absolutely sort of challenge ourselves to sort of look at how we can basically continue to reduce those costs over time. But I think we're very pleased with sort of how we're doing that and sort of how that's showing up in our bottom line.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nAnd I would add, Lloyd, you know us well. These reductions aren't conflated with capital kinds of things. They're not due to dispositions in the portfolio. We don't have 30 lines of reconciliation because the net doesn't ever show up. And they're not cumulative. These are costs that will show up on our bottom line. And as I've said before, just watch us every quarter, and you'll see them materialize. They'll be real, and they'll head straight to the bottom line and to our free cash flow inflection that we've been talking about for the next number of years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks. I know it's always challenging to provide forward guidance with some uncertainty on commodity prices, so I appreciate the details on '26. Looking at total production and capital, it does appear similar to consensus numbers, but there does appear to be a variance to your oil guide relative to consensus. And I was hoping you could help us walk through where we might have sort of missed that. And we do understand there's a lot of complexity given the diversity of assets and other things like Surmont post-sale. But I was wondering if you could walk us through some of that.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey, Scott. This is Andy. I'll get us started with a couple of points here, and then maybe Nick can provide a bit more detail on the Lower 48 for us. So just a couple of things I'd say is that if you look at our third quarter, at the total company, we're at a mix of about 53% oil. And this is the first quarter now where we have the full impact of Surmont that you just referenced. So we now have a higher royalty into Surmont. So the third quarter is a pretty good mark basically as we think about 2026. And we've provided guidance, and hopefully you found that helpful, where we've now provided guidance basically for an oil split and where we're basically forecasting 2026 to be about that 53% for the total company.\nThat does include sort of the bitumen impact of higher royalties at Surmont. Then specifically to Lower 48, we're guiding about 50% for the Lower 48. Then just one final point I would make before Nick can maybe comment on the Lower 48 is when we provided our 2026 guidance of 0 to 2% range for BOEs, that's also a good range for how we're thinking about oil as well. So I think we've tried to sort of guide a bit more on this time. As you say, we recognize, as you provided for us upfront, that there's a lot of moving parts here across the portfolio. But that 53% for the total company, we think is a good mark for next year. Maybe Nick can just add a few comments on Lower 48. Yeah. Thanks, Andy. And good morning, Scott. Yeah.\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP of Lower 48 and Global HSE, ConocoPhillips\n\nIf you look at Q3, Lower 48 oil mix, we were around about 50%. If you compare that to Q2, it was about 50.5%. That was in line with our expectations and our development plan going forward. As Andy mentioned, we're guiding to oil mix at 50% when you look at 2026 forward. Again, that's simply an output of our plan and an output of our development plans where we're developing in the various basins. Now, as a reminder for the group, within the Delaware Basin, that is our most significant growth driver within the Lower 48. So it shouldn't be a surprise to this group that oil mix will trend in that direction. It's low cost of supply, higher gas content, but very good, strong oil content, and good returns.\nAnother key component to think through is we've got two decades plus of drilling inventory at current rig activity levels in the Delaware. It's a pure leading opportunity set out there. Now, one other component that you need to think through is that oil mix can fluctuate depending on the relative contributions from these basins as we drill in different areas. So you might have some higher oil mix, some lower oil mix, and variations from quarter to quarter. But overall, as Andy mentioned, 50% Lower 48 oil mix going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Leggett from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Leggett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. Guys, I'm going to try very hard to make this one question, but I'm hoping you can maybe help us navigate the moving parts a little bit. My question is principally on Willow and the CapEx, what happens after Willow. But it's really about the evolution of your dividend break-even because I think the Willow news has overshadowed the other big news, which, of course, was your dividend increase. So I guess the way I would try and phrase the question is, how damaging is the increase in Willow spending to the cash cadence of the cash flow coming back? And I guess my point specifically is you get qualified CapEx deductible and taxes in Alaska. It's pretty advantaged. So can you walk us through how big a deal this really is and what happens to the dividend break-even as Willow comes online?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey, Doug. This is Andy. I can try and step through that. I think you sort of half answered the question for me in terms of sort of how this works on a tax basis. And Ryan touched on this also in the prepared remarks. And the way I would look at it sort of at a total company level is our break-even is coming down, and it's coming down pretty substantially. Just right now, if you think about where we are right now, our break-even this year, so just on CapEx, is in the mid-40s. You'd add another $10 to that for the dividend. Just from what we've described today from what we're doing from 2025 to 2026, that brings our break-even down in of itself $2 to 3. So we're on this trajectory of, yes, cash flow inflection is going in one direction, which is great.\nOur break-even is also coming down, which is great. As Ryan said in his prepared remarks, that's going to continue to happen where we're going to go all the way down to being in the low 30s on a capital break-even by the time Willow comes online. So I don't think what we've described today with CapEx and Willow going up, and let's not forget also the LNG CapEx coming down, there's having any really sort of notable impact on our break-evens and our ability to sort of generate cash flow over this timeframe. Our cash flow inflection remains unchanged. That's why I think you started the question with the dividend. Hopefully that isn't getting lost in all of the news that we're describing today. But we have now increased that dividend by 8%.\nThis is now the fifth year of us having top quartile growth of the dividend versus the S&P 500. We feel very confident with that break-even that that continues.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. And I would add as well, Doug, look, and it's sustainable given the break-even coming down, as Andy described. The dividend is representing a lower portion of our total cash flow in terms of our distribution back to the shareholders, so it ought to give the shareholders and stakeholders in the company a lot of comfort and conviction that we can continue to deliver top quartile S&P 500 dividend growth in the company well into the future, given the projects that we're executing, the cost of supply of those projects, and the free cash flow growth we're going to see coming out of the company. So it's quite sustainable and leaves us room to buy back some of our shares, which we're leaning into quite a bit right now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nYeah. Good morning. As much as I'd love to ask a few questions on Willow, I'll change the topic a bit. And that is to talk about the 2026 guide at 0% to 2%. And we've seen other large EMPs and integrators with similar sorts of guides in a backdrop where WTI is sitting below $60. So can you talk about what macro world you envision or which you plan for that we're going to see next year? And how does that inform that capital guide and production guide?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Bob. I think we like to say we have a lot of flexibility in the company. Production is kind of an output of our plans. We kind of set sort of a constant level loaded scope within the Lower 48. Nick talked a lot about what that means for kind of the production growth we see coming out of that. Our view of the macro support, again, we kind of set this at a $60 WTI. To your point, WTI is trading a little bit below 60 at this moment in time. Our call would be probably seeing some inventory builds. We saw some this last week. We'll see how it continues onshore in the OECD countries. But we probably see some downside pressure coming through the latter part of the ending part of this year and into maybe the first part of next year.\nBut that's why we have a balance sheet. That's why we have cash on the balance sheet. We want to continue to fund our programs. We came out with a 0% to 2%. We think that sort of makes a lot of sense with the macro that we're seeing today. But it also is informed by the medium and longer term, which we're quite constructive on today. Again, we see about a million barrels a day of demand growth not abating itself throughout this decade and well into the next decade. And we think there's going to be a call on crude and even a call on conventional crude, depending on what you believe the unconventional supply coming out of the US is going to look like at these kinds of prices or even elevated prices.\nSo we see some modest growth in the unconventionals, continuing maybe flat to slight growth into next year, depending on the price. But I think it sets up well to be a bit more reflective as we go into 2026, which was what we've tried to show with our 0% to 2%. But remind everybody, we've got a lot of flexibility in the portfolio both ways. We have opportunities to reduce more CapEx. Should we think that's the need, we can use the balance sheet. Should we decide to do that? Then obviously, we've got opportunities to ramp up on the other end as well. So we just think we have a lot of flexibility in the company. But I think this is a good place to start based on sort of how we view the near-term macro and where it's been developing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Your line is now open.\n\nJeoffrey Lambujon\n\nManaging Director, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. I'll bring it back to Willow if I could. I want to say I appreciate the detail earlier in the call that spoke to the breakdown there on the refreshed expectations. Can you also talk about the confidence level in the updated range and essentially what might be locked in from here? It'd be great to just get a sense for what flexibility there might be up or down if things change enough over the course of the build-out or if the wider range that you have now captures the most likely scenarios in your view, and it's more a function of where you end up within that range. Thanks.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Good morning, Jeff. Again, I would say rewinding back here a little bit, we recognize there was quite a bit of inflation coming out post-COVID over the couple of years leading up to our taking FID in late 2023. We were actually seeing that abate a bit in late 2023, which is why we took a view of just a couple percent. We felt like, obviously, the monetary actions globally, we're going to knock that back a little bit. So again, we took that view at the time. This is just a really good time for us, being roughly halfway through the project, to reconcile what we've been seeing over the last couple of years. As you know, across labor markets and engineered equipment, we've definitely seen some movement, which is much more on the average of 4.5% to 5%.\nAnd that's been actual and realized. You can certainly see the data yourself across the last couple of years. Now, sitting here today, we're seeing inflation rates abate a bit. We're starting to see inflation again in the 3% to 3.5%. But candidly, we're taking a view that this compounding inflation could, based on the contracts that we have tied to market indices, could continue in that 4% to 5% range. And so we've largely budgeted for that for the next three-plus years of the project just to ensure that we're not kind of falling back into prior assumptions in FID. So I would say we've got a lot of confidence in the, obviously, in the way we're putting this capital guide forward here at this time. And again, able to stand here in this position with that confidence because the team is executing just so well on the project.\nWe're not seeing schedule slip. We're not seeing other challenges. Certainly, the upward cost pressure, you're not seeing. We talk about scope discovery. This is really about inflation across the broader market. We've taken a conservative view for the next couple of years. So yeah, confidence in how we're pushing this out here today. Again, just pleased with how the project's moving forward here for the next couple of years.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nOur next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Ryan, I think, as you mentioned earlier, that you think that the maybe increasing call on oil, even on the conventional. And when we're looking at over the past 10 years, I think you guys have drastically reduced your dependence on exploration because you have such a great profile in the Lower 48. And as the shale oil is maturing, how should we look at it? Will you think that you still have such a huge portfolio that you really don't need to increase your exploration effort and you can just rely on that, on the shale oil, to continue to increase your resource, your production? Or that you think the challenge on the longer term is really enough that we need to start maybe increasing the effort, given it's a long-cycle business?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nNo, thanks, Paul. I think you bring up, I guess, there's probably an industry-wide macro question around that. Are we investing enough industry-wide on the exploration side? Have we lost some of that muscle inside the industry for that and large project execution for that matter? There's probably a bit to that from the industry side. Speaking specifically to our company, you're right after kind of the early 2000 timeframe when we first got into the Eagle Ford and saw the growing our unconventional position inside the company and then really changed the portfolio pretty dramatically over the last number of years to really focus on those low cost of supply opportunities and resources that we now have captured inside the company. It has put a less reliance on exploration.\nBut I remind everybody, we continue to spend $200 to 300 million a year on exploration to continue to feed some of the legacy assets we have around the company. In years past, that's been in Malaysia, been in Norway. We've moved that around throughout the years, depending on some of the activity level and the opportunity set that we find. And we're doing that again next year because we're focusing most of that exploration probably up in Alaska to support the Willow development and get the company in a position to be able to feed that infrastructure that we're building out there for decades to come. So it's about a redirection of exploration. But we've been able to do that within that $200 to 300 million allocation inside the company.\nWe just spudded a well in the Otway Basin of Australia to try to find more gas that we can bring into Australia. So this is not just one area where we're appraising the discoveries for good that we had in Norway a year or so ago. So we are spending some of that money. To date, it hasn't captured a higher capital allocation inside the company because we've been able to get everything we wanted to get done for that $200 to 300 million. But I think you're right. Macro-wise, within the industry, you're seeing a lot more of that. We've just been blessed; we're a resource-rich company in a resource-starved world, it looks like, going forward. So I think we're uniquely positioned relative to many of our peers in the industry without having to consider significant ramp-ups in that capital allocation.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\n\nCharles Meade\n\nResearch Analyst, Johnson Rice\n\nGood day to you, Ryan and Andy, and to the rest of the Conoco team there. I'd like to ask a big-picture question about your global LNG strategy. You guys make this distinction between resource LNG and commercial LNG. I'm wondering if you can talk about how you think differently about those two pieces of the business, how they complement each other, and perhaps how they compete with each other. Maybe wrap into that, one could make the argument that with the amount of resource you guys have in the Lower 48, that making a distinction between resource LNG and commercial LNG is kind of a distinction without a difference. Maybe comment on whether that's a valid argument in your view.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips",
    "content2": "Hey, Charles. This is Andy. Yeah, it's a great question and a big question, as you say, in terms of sort of comparing the two and how we think about them. So I'd probably go maybe back all the way to the beginning. We've been in the LNG business really since the 1960s. I think we were involved in basically sort of inventing this business. So we kind of know a thing or two about it. And we've traditionally sort of, until recent years, had what I would call sort of the resource LNG, sort of the traditional LNG business, where it's been very much about finding a stranded gas asset. And you find a gas asset, you find people who will buy the LNG, then you build an LNG facility, and off you go. That's kind of where this industry was for years.\nAnd we've been a big player in that with our Australia asset and our Qatar assets over the years. And that has served us really well. But as you fast forward sort of to what's happening in the Lower 48, it's a little bit of a different model, and you kind of started to touch on this, where you've got so much gas in the Lower 48 that you don't need to treat it like a facility-by-facility approach where you've got the stranded gas that you're trying to tie to one facility. So the whole model is different, effectively, in that you're trying to take this gas in the Lower 48. And our strategy is pretty simple, where we're trying to basically take what we think is low-cost supply North American gas and get ourselves access to international pricing in TTF and JKM.\nAnd that's exactly what we're positioning ourselves to do. And we've made great progress in doing that with, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, the five MTPA at Port Arthur phase one that we've now fully placed. And then we're now moving on to Port Arthur phase two, where we took four MTPA and another one MTPA at Rio Grande. So we're trying to basically get ourselves in a situation where we can basically convert lower 48 gas into international pricing. And what I would remind everybody is that we're also in a position where this commercial strategy complements our business so well. We produce over two BCF a day in the lower 48. And two BCF a day in round numbers is about 15 MTPA. So it also works as a natural hedge to our lower 48 gas exposure.\nSo back to your first off, I don't really see them as the resource LNG competing with what we're doing in the Lower 48. They're kind of different models, but we've certainly been able to learn from the resource LNG. And that's why we've been able to sort of implement the strategy we are doing, basically, where we're trying to control the entire value chain. And you only can do that with our global size and scale. And that's how we basically think we capture the economic rent. So hopefully, that helps sort of frame up how we think about the difference between the two. But it's not like an either-or choice for us.\nWe think that they both serve a really important role, and we're happy to be playing in both, as you can see, with NFE and NFS on the resource side and what we're doing on the commercial side with Port Arthur and the other announcements we've made today.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nOur next question comes from James West from Melius Research. Your line is now open.\n\nJames West\n\nManaging Director, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys, or I guess close to good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the LNG question. Obviously, the strategy is pretty clearly defined here. You had a lot of commercial movement during the quarter. You're at 10 MTPA now. I think you've said the past 10 to 15 is kind of a range. Are we at a point where maybe you pause and digest, or do you lean in and go up to that 15?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'd say very briefly, our strategy remains unchanged. We're executing exactly what we said. The 10 to 15 MTPA is a size that we feel very comfortable about. It gives us the size that we want to be able to optimize our portfolio, be able to divert cargoes, as I mentioned in the prior question, be able to control really the value chain. And I don't think anything's really changed there, that the 10 to 15 is kind of what we're looking to fill out right now.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nI think, James, it's also a function of not getting too much commitments on the front end, make sure you can place it on the back end. So we're being deliberate about that. And if we get more opportunity for low-liquefaction-cost opportunities, we'll add more to the 10 million MTPA, but we got to back it up with regas on the other end and have a plan for it. So we're being deliberate now that we've reached that 10-million-ton mark.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Kevin MacCurdy from Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\n\nKevin MacCurdy\n\nManaging Director, Pickering Energy Partners\n\nHey, thank you guys for fitting me in. I want to come back to slide seven for a moment on the incremental free cash flow. And I know that you've shown this before with the $4 billion of free cash flow from Willow, but I think that's quite an eye-catching number. I was wondering if you could provide anything kind of high level on how you get there in terms of margins, productions, maintenance, and CapEx in that first year. Also to ask if that's a fairly good number to use heading forward for Willow post-2029.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Hi, Kevin. Good morning. This is Kirk. So certainly, as you saw in the waterfall, the details, and the supplementals on Willow, you can really take it directly from that. So as we compare against what was a historical and expected spend here this year of just over $2 billion, as mentioned by Andy in the prepared remarks, we're expecting that here on the Willow capital spend here this year. And then that moves down, plateaus for the next couple of years. And then on sustaining capital post-first oil, we're expecting to spend roughly half a billion dollars in just continued development drilling for the Willow project. Obviously, we're starting pre-drill. We've got some pre-drill planned in 2027. And then that will extend. And that pre-drill is all baked within our total Willow project spend. But then post-first oil, that half a billion dollars.\nSo in essence, what you're seeing is this inflection downward of capital from roughly 2 billion to an average of half a billion first oil. And then at first oil, you're getting the CFO associated with, again, why we like Alaska. It's 100% oil sales. It's Brent premium. And again, that is the balance then of the $4 billion free cash flow improvement against a reduction of roughly $1.5 billion on CapEx. And I just remind Kevin that you see all the prices that that's assumed at $70 prices. And we've given a sensitivity to that as well in the materials. Well, let me thank everybody for participating today. Just a few summary comments. We continue to execute well. We're improving our plan, and we're well positioned for a strong 2026, as evidenced by the new guidance we've provided today.\nI'd say the team continues to find a lot of ways to enhance value in what we think is a differentiated investment thesis. We have an unmatched portfolio quality. We've got a leading Lower 48 inventory depth combined with attractive longer cycle investments in the LNG in Alaska that we've described today in quite a bit of detail. We continue to have a strong track record of returns on and of our capital. That's all leading to a sector-leading free cash flow growth profile that takes us all the way to the end of this decade. Thank you all for your interest in ConocoPhillips, and we appreciate the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

    "content": "Q2 2025 ConocoPhillips Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2025 ConocoPhillips Earnings Call\n\nCOPNYSEAUG 7, 12:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to the Q2 2025 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call. My name is Liz, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During the question-and-answer session, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone phone. I will now turn the call over to Guy Baber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nGuy Baber\n\nVP Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Liz, and welcome everyone to our second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Andy O'Brien, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Strategy and Commercial; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48 and Global HSE; and Kirk Johnson, Executive Vice President of Global Operations and Technical Functions. Ryan and Andy will kick off the call with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. For Q&A, we will be taking one question per caller. A few quick reminders today. First, along with the release, we publish supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can now find on the Investor Relations website. Also, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\nActual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. We will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Guy, and thank you to everyone for joining our Q2 2025 earnings conference call. Starting with results and outlook, we delivered another strong execution quarter, once again exceeding the top end of our production guidance range. We reiterated the midpoint of our full year production guidance even with the announced agreement to sell our Anadarko Basin asset for $1.3 billion, and our capital spending and operating cost guidance ranges, both of which we lowered last quarter, remain unchanged on return of capital. We may remain on track to distribute about 45% of our full year CFO to shareholders this year. That's consistent with our prior guidance and.\nOur long-term track record.\nThe bottom line, we're operating well, we're delivering on our plan, and we're well positioned for a strong second half of the year with clear free cash flow tailwinds including lower capital spending. Turning to the Marathon Oil acquisition, I'm pleased to announce that the asset integration is now complete and that we've significantly outperformed our acquisition case. We added more high-quality, low-cost supply resource, we're achieving more synergies, we're delivering a more efficient Lower 48 development program, and we've already announced more asset sales than we guided at the time of the transaction announcement. While these are all significant achievements, we're not stopping there. Given our integration success, which builds upon other successful transactions as well as our recent implementation of a new company-wide enterprise resource system, we continue to drive for improvement across every level of the organization.\nAs part of this effort, we've identified more than $1 billion of additional cost reduction and margin enhancement opportunities. Now to be clear, that's on top of the more than $1 billion of Marathon synergies we've already expected to realize. Additionally, now that we've exceeded our $2 billion asset sales objective ahead of schedule, we're raising our total disposition target to $5 billion.\nCollectively, these initiatives will strengthen our ability to generate strong returns on and in capital through the cycles and enhance our long-term value proposition. That's a value proposition that's already differentiated not only relative to our sector, but relative to the broader S&P 500 as well. We believe we have the highest quality asset base in our peer space. Our global portfolio is deep, durable, and diverse, and we're recognized as having the most advantaged US inventory position in the sector. We believe this advantage will become increasingly apparent as the US shale industry continues to mature and investors are forced to more clearly sort through what we call the inventory haves and have nots. We are a clear leader in the US inventory haves.\nIn addition, we're uniquely investing in our high quality portfolio, specifically in our longer cycle projects in LNG and Alaska to deliver strong returns and a compelling multi-year free cash flow growth profile. Assuming a $70 per barrel WTI price environment, we expect the major projects we're currently progressing in combination with the additional cost and margin enhancements we just announced to drive a $7 billion free cash flow inflection by 2029. That would almost double the consensus free cash flow expectation for the entire company this year. Now with that, let me turn the call over to Andy to cover our second quarter performance, 2025 guidance and strategic objectives in more detail.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks Ryan. Starting with our Q2 performance, as Ryan mentioned, we had another quarter of strong execution across the portfolio. We produced 2,391,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, once again exceeding the high end of our production guidance. In the Lower 48 production averaged 1,508,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Alaska and international production averaged 883,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as we successfully complete turnarounds in Norway and Qatar. Regarding our Q2 financials, we generated $1.42 per share in adjusted earnings and $4.7 billion of CFO. We had a $1.5 billion working capital headwind, effectively offsetting the equivalent sized tailwind we realized last quarter. Capital expenditures were $3.3 billion. Slightly down quarter on quarter, we returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.2 billion in buybacks and $1 billion in ordinary dividends.\nThrough the first half of this year, we've returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders, about 45% of our CFO. Consistent with our full-year guidance and long-term track record. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.7 billion plus $1.1 billion in long-term liquid investments.\nTurning to our outlook for full year production guidance, we have narrowed the range and reiterated the guidance midpoint even after adjusting for the Anadarko sale of approximately 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is expected to close at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Our capital spend and cost guidance ranges, both of which we reduced last quarter, are unchanged. We now expect our full year effective corporate tax rate to be in the mid- to high-30% range excluding one-time items, lower than we previously guided due to geographical mix, and we now expect a total full year deferred tax benefit of about $0.5 billion, primarily reflecting the positive impacts from the one big beautiful bill. In the second half of the year we expect free cash flow tailwinds in the form of higher APLNG distributions, cash tax benefits, and lower capital spending.\nFurther guidance details can be found on our earnings slide deck. Turning now to our strategic updates, as Ryan noted, we have completed the Marathon asset integration and are realizing comprehensive outperformance against our acquisition case. We're delivering everything we said and much more.\nFirst, we've upgraded our low-cost supply resource estimate by 25%. While we were most attracted to Marathon's significant Eagle Ford and Bakken positions, both of which are every bit as good as we expected and delivering excellent well results. The majority of the increase has been driven by the Permian, where our resource estimate has approximately doubled versus the initial estimate. The second point I would highlight, we have significantly outperformed our initial synergy guidance. At the time of the transaction announcement, we guided $500 million of annual synergies. With our steady-state capital development program achieved and critical system cutovers now in the rearview mirror, we are on a glide path to realize more than $1 billion of run-rate synergies by the end of the year. In addition, we've identified over $1 billion of one-time benefits, largely cash-tax-related.\nWhile we don't count this as a synergy, it's real value and a material benefit to our company.\nThe third point I'd highlight, we brought the power of our more efficient and steady state development program to the combined portfolio. At the time of the transaction announcement, we highlighted our ability to more efficiently develop Marathon's acreage. Given our size and scale advantage, and ability to level load our program versus Marathon's practice of ramping activity up and down, we've now achieved optimized level of steady state activity and we're delivering more combined production with 30% fewer rigs and frac crews in comparison to the pre-transaction pro forma activity levels. Finally, with the announced Anadarko sale, we've now signed over $2.5 billion of dispositions within nine months of the transaction close, beating our $2 billion target well ahead of schedule.\nGiven our growth in recent years and implementation of our new company-wide ERP system, we are taking the opportunity for further cost and margin improvements across the entire company. We've identified more than $1 billion of opportunities that we expect to realize on a run rate basis by the end of 2026. All of this is in addition to the $1 billion of Marathon synergies we previously discussed that we expect to realize on a run rate basis by the end of this year. These additional improvements will be wide-ranging, encompassing cost reductions across our SG&A, operating costs, and transportation costs as well as margin enhancement through commercial opportunities. All in, including the Marathon synergies, we expect to drive over $2 billion of run rate improvements by the end of next year.\nIn addition to furthering our cost reduction initiatives, we are more than doubling our asset sales target to $5 billion, which we also expect to achieve by the end of next year. We see a clear opportunity to further high grade our portfolio and accelerate value realization for assets that are not currently competing for capital.\nSo, to wrap up, we continue to execute well operationally, financially, and across our strategic initiatives. We are well positioned for the second half of the year with clear free cash flow tailwinds, and we continue to find ways to enhance our differentiated long-term investment thesis. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it over to the operator to start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one. Again, if you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone phone.\nOur first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, good afternoon, Ryan. Andy and team really appreciate the incremental disclosure and love this slide seven. So Ryan, maybe we could start there, which is, you know, if you look at street numbers at around $60 to $70 WTI, you're generating close to $8 billion of free cash flow this year. So if you add $6 to $7, you're kind of closer to $14, which implies by 2029 a 12% free cash flow yield. So first one to just check the math on and make sure that we're not missing any pieces around it. And then to the extent that is the right framework, which is a great price in a couple of years, the pushback might be, you got to wait for it.\nRyan, maybe your perspective on, hey, with every year you de-risk towards that free cash flow number as capital intensity improves, so you don't necessarily have to wait to 2029 would be a theory, but it would be just your perspective on all that.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Neil. Go to the head of the class. Your math is pretty good.\nLook. Yeah, we're working pretty hard. As you mentioned, the numbers fit exactly where we're thinking about in that $60 to $70 range. You know, we'll add about $7 billion of free cash flow between now and 2029. I mean, you don't have to wait till 2029. Some of that's coming through the, about 1/3 or so is coming through the LNG channel. And there's going to be consistent startups starting next year with Qatar, one of the trains in Qatar, 2027 with Port Arthur, 2028 with another train in Qatar, and then 2029 with Willow. So all of that's coming, everything's on track. And you're right, it nearly doubles our current consensus free cash flow that I said in my opening remarks. And I think this is a trajectory and a, you know, things that are coming that are unique in the business.\nThere's no other E&P that I think can match, you know, what's coming for us, including the integrated majors. So I think we're unique in this space. We've been leaning in and making these investments that are very competitive in the portfolio low-cost opportunities for the company that are going to, you know, contribute to our growth and development for decades to come. And I would say too that it does not include.\nThe inventory advantage we currently have in the Lower 48, a very deep and.\nTier 1 inventory that we have and where we're constructive in the macro going long term. If the call for shale production starts to come up, because where is the supply coming to meet the growing demand that we believe is going to be there? This doesn't even include what we could do to lean into our Lower 48 a little bit more. We haven't because the call hasn't been there to date. So we're growing at a bit more modest rate. But we're taking advantage of the integration, we're taking advantage of the synergies. You know, I remind people we haven't added a rig in three, four years.\nSo we're just continuing to grow our Lower 48 just through the efficiency in the channel. So none of that even includes what we could do depending what the call is for unconventional production going forward. So no, your math's good, Neil. We're excited about the opportunities for the company.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nArun Jayaram\n\nResearch Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nYeah. Good morning. Good afternoon, team, Ryan. I was wondering if you could unpack the $1 billion-dollar cost reduction in margin optimization plan, which looks to be a new wrinkle in the update. You mentioned the ERP system integration. I was wondering if you could talk about what are some of the drivers of the $1 billion and are you doing anything at the organizational level to.\nReengineer kind of your operating strategy?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, no, Arun, it's going to touch, you know, all pieces of the company. There's some, you know, some workforce centralization, some things that we've learned over the last three to four years with all the transactions that we've done that we're going to be implementing kind of globally throughout the company. So there's a piece of G&A built into this. There's utilizing the scale and scope of the company to drive some lease operating expense improvements as well. Things that we're doing contractually, things that we've captured in the Lower 48 and understand from an efficiency perspective that we can drive throughout the whole company.\nAs we've grown our scale, we also see opportunities in transportation and processing, and that's going to show up as expense reduction and margin expansion through realized price improvement. Commercially, I'd say about 80% of it sits within the G&A, LOE, TNP just expense reductions. 20% of it sits in that margin expansion bucket. And I would tell you none of this includes capital sort of things. We don't count that in our synergy estimates. We're just talking about stuff that'll flow through the bottom line and changes that we need to make as a result of some of the technologies we're deploying and the size, scale, and scope of the company through the inorganic expansions that we've had over the three to four years.\nIt's with that behind us now. Time for us to get the whole company running, taking advantage of stuff that we've invested in over the last few years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\nAppreciate you're probably not going to tell.\nUs, what's for sale, Ryan, in terms.\nOf this meaningfully increased divestiture target. But you know, perhaps you can give.\nus some perspectives on the acquisition market from the sell side and maybe just.\nTalk about the types of assets and.\nI'm sure you're intently focused on cost of supply in terms of the high.\nGrading, but maybe you could talk to.\nSort of asset types, and that process, and the confidence on that higher target.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, no thanks, Steve. I think we've described to you and others that are on the call and we go through pretty rigorous exercise every year. We've kind of come out of the back end of our planning exercise that ramps up during the summer months, and through that process we look at every asset in the portfolio and we look for the ones that are competing for capital and those that aren't competing for capital. And we tell our teams for the assets that are on the outside looking in a little bit. Maybe there's different technologies we can deploy, different ways to think about it, different learnings from across the company. We give them some time to see if they can compete for capital long term, but if they don't, then they migrate to a different list.\nAnd look, we're resource rich in a resource scarce world today. So that's what I think. We were pleasantly surprised with the Anadarko Basin. We know there's an example that wasn't going to compete for capital in the portfolio. We're getting plenty of North American natural gas production from our assets in North America. It just wasn't going to compete for capital as we integrated that asset into the company, and we were pretty pleased with the price that we got. So as we scrub the portfolio and think about it going forward with the remainder of this year and through 2026, we just felt like we see the assets that are out there and that aren't competing for capital, and we think it's going to be a reasonable market to be selling into, which is what gave us confidence to increase the target to $5 billion.\nWe've already surpassed our two billion target as Andy described in his remarks to date with about two and a half billion sold through this point in time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Leggett with Wolfe Research.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\nGood morning everyone.\nRyan, amidst all these incredibly positive updates, I hate to ask such an asinine question as cash tax, but I'm going to make Andy earn his keep today. You've got a $500 million incremental deferred for 2025.\nObviously, there's a lot of moving parts.\nWith the M&A, you know, Marathon and obviously asset sales and so on. What is the sustainable deferred tax?\nVisibility that you have for the Lower 48 at this point if you're able to offer any color beyond 2025?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey Doug, it's Andy. Yeah, you're going to make me earn my stripes for the first question.\nThere's quite a few moving parts to tax this quarter. Maybe I'll just try to cover them sort of step by step and sort of try and get everything covered in tax in one question here.\nSo just to clear it, because I think some of this gets conflated in terms of what's the one big beautiful bill impacting, what isn't impacting. So just starting with the quarter, in terms of our Q2 effective tax rate, we were lower than we guided last quarter.\nAnd we've actually reduced the full-year effective tax rate to the mid-30s for the rest of the year. So that was purely due to sort of a mix where we had domestic commodity prices relative to international markets were a bit higher than we forecast, and that resulted in a higher mix of income from our lower tax jurisdictions like the US. So that's probably the first thing that jumps out to people: the effective tax rate. The second thing, going on to the deferred taxes, you know, we saw a larger than expected deferred tax benefit during Q2 that had nothing to do with the new tax bill. That was largely due to one-off discrete items that we really don't forecast.\nAnd then getting probably to the meat of your question in terms of first of all the expected benefits, we covered this on our prepared remarks. But this year we think the one big beautiful bill will have about $0.5 billion impact to us. And that's primarily due just simply to the bonus depreciation rate going from 40%-100%. Now, of course that's going to carry on into 2026, and we'll continue to benefit from that bonus depreciation. But specifically to get into numbers at this point, a little bit too early. And I think you helped answer the question for me in terms of why we've got to land exactly where the CapEx is, what's happening with which assets are being disposed of. But what we do know is that it's going to be a tailwind for us the next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, Ryan, Andy.\nHow are you guys?\nI think that 30% fewer rigs and frac crews actually equates to almost 100% of what Marathon is running at the time of the deal, is very impressive.\nBut let me just.\nI guess I'll ask my question about the LNG and kind of the downstream.\nStrategy and just kind of what you're.\nExpecting from regasification sales deals going forward.\nAnd then, how do we expect that?\nTo contribute over the next few years?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'll maybe start, let Andy jump in on the LNG side, but yeah, you stuck in two for one there. Good job, Doug or Lloyd, you're good there. Look. Yeah, I think we're pretty impressed with what Nick and his team have done with the integration in Marathon. But you're right, we've effectively eliminated their 10 rig program and not only delivered the pro forma production between the two companies, but growing the production as well. So I think Nick's team's really hitting on all the cylinders and we're really pleased with the success we've had. The aggressive way that they tackled that program as well. I can let Andy talk a little bit about the LNG side.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nSure. I think on the LNG side you're probably specifically referring to some of the stuff that we've announced this quarter where we've added another 1.5 MTPA of regas capacity at Dunkirk in France. And we also executed an SPA with an Asian buyer. And what I'm particularly pleased about is, were those two announcements. We've now effectively placed the entire 5 MTPA from Port Arthur. So going forward, we're now at a point where we're continuing to have conversations both on the offtake side of things and on the placement. But everything is tracking really well. We've placed everything we have today. So now we're looking basically to the next steps. And what I can say in that space is that things certainly aren't slowing down both in terms of opportunities for more offtake, and conversations with customers in Europe and Asia.\nProbably a bit of a watch this space. Hopefully we'll have more to talk about in coming quarters. Really pleased how the commercial LNG part is starting to come together to really complement what we've already got with our resource LNG in Australia and Qatar.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Betty Jiang with Barclays.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi team, thank you for taking my question. Maybe a deep follow-up to your comment earlier about trying to understand where the CapEx lands for next year. I was wondering if you guys can give an early read on how you're thinking about 2026 at the moment with the additional cost savings you're envisioning.\nCommodity prices probably a bit more supportive. How do you see development evolving next year? Where do you expect the major capital spend to trend, and maybe just frame how much of that long term free cash flow inflection could get captured next year?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nCFO and EVP of Strategy and Commercial, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks Betty, I can try and take that one. And yeah, it is a little early to be talking about 2026, but I'm happy to share a few high-level thoughts. So starting on the capital spending side of things, we've been saying this for a number of quarters now. We expect our capital next year to be lower than this year, the beginning of the cash flow fleet inflection, and then maybe also just to touch on production. I think we've always been saying that for us production really it's just simply an output of our plan. And if you look at what we're doing this year from our guidance, basically it implies about 2% growth on an underlying basis this year. And in the macro environment we see right now, I think this would be a pretty good place to start for modeling premises for next year.\nI think Ryan mentioned it on the rig side in a previous question. We haven't added essentially a rig in the Lower 48 on the lateral footage side over three years, and right now probably don't really see a good reason to do that. But you know, the other thing I would add is that you know, in terms of maybe just going to sort of first half this year to second half next year, we're already starting to see, you know, the cash flow inflection coming. If you look at our CapEx guidance, you know, we're guiding from first half this year to second half to the second half that our CapEx is going to be down $1 billion.\nYou know, you can see from our CFO from the first half to the second half that, you know, we're also going to have some tailwinds from higher APLNG distributions and the one big beautiful bill. So when you look at that and that continues on into 2026, I'd actually say that the cash flow inflection is effectively already starting.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOur next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.\n\nNitin Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHi, good afternoon. Good morning, everyone.\nRyan, one of your peers talked about.\nIndustry consolidation, you know, going forward. You mentioned in the last three to.\nFour years you've been at the forefront of that.\nJust want to get a take on, you know, where do you see the M&A landscape right now, particularly in Lower 48?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Nitin, I think, look, I think there's still going to be consolidation in this business. I think a lot of the E&Ps in the unconventional space look out into their plans two to three years out and wonder what's going to happen.\nAnd that hasn't changed as capital intensity. People that don't have the inventory like we do face higher capital intensities. And just what do they do about that? Now, specific to us, you know, this is the strongest, I think our portfolio has ever been. And so it's a pretty high bar. And we're focused pretty heavily right now on the organic side of the business where the investments we're making to grow and develop the company, both short, medium, and long term. So I think that's where all of our focus is going. But look, we watch the market every day. We see what other people are doing. And I'm familiar with the comments that were made by one of our peers.\nBut we're just in a different position because of the effort and what we've done over the last four years that you pointed out and the focus we're trying to drive internal to the company to chase another $1 billion of additional cash flow growth in the company. We see the inflection that Andy just talked about in our free cash flow coming as these projects start starting up over the course of the next three to four years. So we've got a pretty high bar and a pretty full plate today just executing on our organic plans.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat, thanks.\nMaybe a question on the.\nOn the Marathon transaction, you increased your expectation for the incremental resource adds from 2 billion to 2.5 billion barrels with a doubling of resource, estimated resource in the Permian. Can you talk about what's driving that? What's been better than expected, particularly in the Permian.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Ryan, good morning. Yeah, as a reminder for the folks on the call, the Marathon transaction, we announced the 2 billion barrels of low cost supply resource. You know, now we've got eight months under the Marathon hood to further assess the inventory and the development strategy across all the assets. As Andy mentioned, after completing the integration, we've got a 25% increase. So that's the 2.5 billion. Now, we were clear at the time of the acquisition that the quality positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken were the primary strategic rationale for the transaction. And we're seeing on aggregate the performance in those two basins have been in line to even better than we expected with very strong well productivity versus the acquisition case.\nNow, the upside identified as Andy mentioned is primarily in the Delaware Basin where we've approximately doubled our low cost supply resource estimate with some additional resource in the Bakken as well. Now, in the Permian, this is largely driven by a greater contribution of both primary and secondary intervals across the play. For example, we got inventory across Wolfcamp A and C, Bone Springs, and Woodford formations which are very competitive cost of supply. And Ryan, that's through really reassessing the inventory and applying our development strategy including spacing and stacking. In fact, we're drilling some Wolfcamp A and C wells as well as some Woodford wells right now and seeing really promising results in line or even better than the type curves.\nIn addition to the inventory I just described, we're also seeing opportunities to trade acreage to core up positions, adding more longer laterals which improves the cost of supply. If you go from a one- to three-mi lateral, we see that 30% -40% improvement. So, hats off to the team as we get under the hood. They're excited there's more opportunities in there, so getting ready and enthused to execute upon it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYes, thanks, Ryan.\nIt'd be good to hear your view of what you're seeing on the oil macro front. Obviously, if we wind the clock back last quarter, there's a lot of uncertainty.\nOil price obviously is firmed up.\nI know you all do a lot of work, but I'd be interested in your thoughts on what you're seeing right now and how that could shape your plans into 2026.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Scott. I think I described it as choppy this morning on CNBC, I think, and that's kind of our, I'd say short to.\nNear-term view of the macro look. The OPEC groups added about; they've unwound all the 2.2 million barrels a day of cuts, and then they added 300,000 more allocation to the UAE, bring that to 2.5. Our internal view is about 800,000 of that is already in the market. So of that 2.5 you'd take 800,000. So there's about 1.7 million barrels a day true incremental production. But that hasn't shown up in exports either because of the power burn, and all the summer burn in the Middle East that's going on right now. And the demand grew in the first half a little bit more than what we would have predicted, a little bit over a million barrels a day. I think for the full year we're still at about 800,000 barrels a day of demand.\nIncreases coming forward. So you can see it's a bit imbalanced, more supply than the demand in the short term. But we got to remember that inventories that are five-year low, certainly here in the US we're seeing some early indication that floating inventories might be coming up a little bit. Certainly China is filling their SPR right now to feed their Teapot Refineries. So there is a lot of moving pieces as you say. So how do we think about that? We step back, we see the choppiness, although prices are hanging in about at our mid cycle price and they've been relatively stable in the $60s.\nSo we see probably that continuing with probably a bit more pressure to the downside, which is why Andy talked about how we're executing our program and kind of how you should think about modeling our production as we go into 2026. And that's just, you know, we probably see a little bit of choppiness and some, you know, slight, slight headwinds as we go. But we're very constructive. When you start stepping back for a minute and thinking about the longer term, we see demand continuing to grow at a million barrel a day incremental clip. We're at all-time highs in the demand side, and we don't think that's stopping. So we do wonder where the.\nSupply is going to come to fill that growing demand over the next two, three, four, five years and beyond, which was our view over the last few years, which is why we're leaning into some of the longer cycle projects. That's the oil side. And then obviously on the gas side we're pretty, we're pretty bullish there. We see the LNG market growing from a 400 million-ton market to over 700 million-ton market within the next five to 10 years. Which is why we wanted to lean into the LNG side of the business. And we see a lot of resource in the US to support that and to underpin that strategy. So maybe that's a Reader's Digest abridged version of our view of the macro, both on the oil and the gas side.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.\n\nCharles Meade\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Johnson Rice\n\nGood morning, Ryan, you and your team there, and I caught your CNBC appearance.\nI thought that was a fine job.\nI wanted to ask a question on Willow.\nIf you could perhaps give us a.\nBit of a preview for what, when you do get back to work there.\nOn the ground in the winter season.\nWhat does this next winter season hold?\nAs far as key milestones, work streams, and just an overview.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I can let Kirk take that\nCharles.\nI would say we haven't quit working. We're pretty busy right now. We got to. I was just up there last week. We got a full team on the slope working through the summer, and a lot of work going on in the Corpus Christi Kiewit fab yard too, building modules. But Kirk can jump in and give you a bit more specifics.\n\nKirk Johnson\n\nEVP Global Operations and Technical Functions, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah.\nMorning, Charles.\nYeah, certainly, as Ryan is mentioning, our execution here this year just continues to be really quite strong. We did wrap that winter season up. It was the largest that we had certainly in the last couple years, and really the largest we have here planned for the project. We wrapped that up late April, early May. And so we've transitioned again, as Ryan witnessed, we're transitioning to year-round construction up there on the slope. We actually have about 900 tradesmen and craftsmen up on the slope right now. And that's down from again, what we were seeing during this peak winter season, which was closer to 2,400, if not 2,500 people up there on the slope. So it's been a pretty big trend transition for us here this spring.\nBut of course our teams are really focused now, as you're alluding to, which is the activities we have here this summer and this fall. So with that transition, those 900 craftsmen on the slope are continuing to build out that operations center that we see lifted up here last year with those modules on location. And so there's a lot of work ongoing so that we can truly begin year-round construction there in Alaska at the Willow location. And then again, as Ryan mentioned, outside of Alaska, we're focused on completing engineering in support of these process modules that we're building here on the Gulf Coast and then naturally that's going to continue through 2027. But certainly I would say as it.\nRelates to the activities here this year.\nThere's a lot of work by the.\nTeam focusing appropriately on.\nContracting procurement, general supply chain activities. Admittedly, tariffs have introduced some level of uncertainty, and that's manifesting with internationally sourced equipment alongside a trend of inflation that's pretty similar to what we've seen in the international markets. And that's stabilizing as activities stabilize here. So it's a good time for us to put a wrapper on some of these contracts here. This year we'll have close to 90% or 95% of these contracts pretty well secured by year end. And so a lot of work in that space. So again, Charles, I would say strong execution. We're hitting the really key milestones.\nWe have some more work, of course, in this next winter season as it relates to gravel on the North Slope, continuing to build that out towards the next set of pads and then kind of wrapping up the last pieces around pipelines and a bit of civil work. So certainly more to come. But the milestones we're achieving, we're hitting.\nThose as we expect.\nAnd so it just continues to give us a lot of confidence in execution and strong expectations. Again, around 2029 and first oil.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys.\nRyan, I want to ask about Eagle Ford, but before that, can I just sneak in and just clarify or that.\nConfirmed will load their CapEx is still at $7 billion. In terms of Eagle Ford with.\nThe Marathon deal, they do have some really decent assets here.\nCan you give us an outlook where you see Eagle Ford on a longer term basis? I mean, I think in the past that you have a view where that Eagle Ford will get to.\nMaybe for you guys, they call it.\n300,000 barrels per day.\nNow, with this better performance in Q2 and also that much larger resource base, how should we look at?\nEagle Ford for your portfolio? Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Paul. I can let Nick chime in on the Eagle Ford part. I think we're seeing everything and then some based on the acquisition case we had for Marathon and some of the well results that I've seen over the last few months coming out of Eagle Ford on the Marathon acreage in particular, let alone our acreage, has given us a lot of comfort in the case and we're seeing upside out of that as well. I can let Nick talk a little bit about the longer term perspective we might see in the Eagle Ford.\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP, Lower 48 and Global HSE\n\nYeah, thanks, Paul. Maybe just talk about short term here on the Eagle Ford. Obviously, as you pointed out, we had a really strong quarter related to Eagle Ford production. Had really strong base production as well as new wells coming online. We actually had a little bit of lumpiness, brought 10% more wells online in Q2 in Eagle Ford. So you saw that slight bump in production. I will say.\nWe're really starting to get our understanding around the Marathon component in Eagle Ford. And what we're seeing there, Paul, is the wells are performing at or above type curve. So that's really good. I also say in Eagle Ford we're sharing best practices across the Marathon, the Conoco. And you may have heard that we had our best year ever in drilling within that asset. We had a 13% improvement in feet per day by combining best practices in drilling. So just hats off to the team there. A couple other things on near term, one of the things related to the acquisition, we're also sharing our facilities, being able to combine those two where we can reroute production, we can shelter maintenance, and that's leading to that increased production as well. So in summary, really strong Q2.\nNow if I look longer term, as Ryan mentioned, when you take a look at the inventory combined for Eagle Ford, we have an industry-leading position. We're sitting on 15 years of inventory that's at current rig activities levels and now hold a significant share of the remaining Tier 1 inventory in the play. No one else comes close to that. Longer term, we're continuing to assess the optimum plateau of that asset and we'll give you an update. One of the things we're looking at is the ongoing efficiencies that we continue to see outperform quarter to quarter. And so dialing into an exact plateau remains ongoing discussion. But that said, we'll land somewhere, you know, modestly below Q2 production as we go forward here in the near term. So really strong performance across Eagle Ford, really strong. What we're seeing with the well results.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Leo Mariani with Roth.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director, ROTH\n\nHi, I just wanted to follow up.\nA little bit on the asset sales here.\nCould you maybe give us what the?\nRough production split is on the 40,000 barrel a day you're selling there in the Anadarko in terms of oil and gas? And then, can you just talk a little bit about the timing on asset sales? Was there a particular reason you decided to kind of increase it right now? Certainly a lot of the conversation the call is talking about kind of macro uncertainty out there.\nSo, maybe just kind of talk about.\nThe environment to sell stuff now.\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP, Lower 48 and Global HSE\n\nYeah, no thanks, Leo. As I tried to describe again, we just go through a standard process inside our company to identify potential assets that we think would be worth more to other people than they are to us. And that's certainly proven out in the Anadarko Basin asset sale too. I can have Guy come back to you with the liquids mix. I don't know. It was mostly gas, but I don't know what the liquids mix is on that: 30,000 barrels a day. But Guy can come back and provide that to you. And look, you know, we don't, you know, we will sell assets when we think we're getting good value for them. Look, we know what our whole value is. We know what they're worth to us inside the portfolio. We're not fire selling anything in the company.\nThere's assets that we've marketed that we haven't sold. We haven't sold because either the macro, current macro environment wasn't supportive of it. Again, we know what our hold value is and we know what the market is and we'll move them out. As we look across that portfolio of opportunities for the company, we felt comfortable with a $5 billion target by the end of next year. So feel comfortable we got those assets.\nTo kind of sell, and we're hard.\nAt work trying to deliver that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Philip Jungwirth with BMO.\n\nPhillip Jungwirth\n\nManaging Director, BMO\n\nThanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about return on capital. Conoco has historically been a leader here among the independents and integrated. We have seen corporate returns come down across the sector, much of which is oil price, but also M&A slowdown. When you look at the organic $6 billion free cash inflection that you have for major project startups, I was hoping you can talk to how this improves ROCE by the end of the decade, or there'd be more improvement\nreally\nfrom accelerating the Lower 48 growth at the right commodity price?\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP, Lower 48 and Global HSE\n\nYeah, Phil, look, you know, all these projects that we're executing meet our cost of supply hurdles. So it almost kind of doesn't matter where you allocate. You're going to see the growth in the ROCE. And that's what we're trying to drive inside the company. We're trying to be competitive with the S&P 500, not just competitive with our peers in this industry. We want to outperform even the S&P 500. Give investors a resource or an investment choice that they can invest in that can deliver year in, year out through the cycles competitive ROCE. And obviously when the price whittles down as much as it may have did in the COVID year, it's tough. And in 2022 it was pretty damn good as prices was back. But we're trying to deliver through the cycle ROCE improvements and invest to compete against the S&P 500.\nThat's what we're about. That's how our performance gets judged.\nThat's what we're trying to go do. As you inflect your free cash flow to $6 to $7 billion over the course of the next three to four years, obviously the CFO is growing. We do have a unique value proposition in this business which is you get your CFO off the top from us; we have a commitment of a minimum of 30% at a mid cycle price. When prices have exceeded that like they have for the last number of years, we've given a lot more of that CFO back, about 45%. So that's what we're signaling again this year and we don't see that changing. So as that free cash flow inflects and our CFO grows, you know, distributions are going to grow with that. The opportunity to invest in our organic programs come with that.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nStrengthening the balance sheet comes with that as well. But absolutely, as our cash flow grows and free cash flow grows, distributions grow as well. We're investing in the right things. We believe in what we're investing in. Our ROCE will grow on a mid cycle case basis as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Kalei Akamine with Bank of America.\n\nKalei Akamine\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Look, I appreciate the strong performance in Lower 48. Last time you gave an outlook on a multi-year basis was in 2023. And in it, you suggested that there will be a capital ramp through the early 2030s. But when you look at the business today and the efficiencies achieved, it appears that you're still on the same production track. So, kind of wondering if you can hit those production targets without adding significant\nactivity or without any change in CapEx.\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP, Lower 48 and Global HSE\n\nYeah, I mean that's the name of this game. You got to be capital light, capital efficient. And that's how you grow your ROCE and that's how you grow your distributions and your free cash flow. So you're right to observe the last time we updated the market. Since then we've done the Marathon transaction. You know, as I think Andy alluded to in some of his questions and comments. We haven't added a rig line any one of the last three, three to four years. We're still delivering the production growth out of Lower 48. We're just being a lot more efficient, a lot less capital spend, and that's the name of the game. So we start every year thinking about, let's just keep the scope of what we're doing constant.\nAs Andy said in his response to one of the questions, you know, the production or the growth that comes out of that is purely an output. We always start trying to keep our stable programs in place. We don't want to whipsaw up, we don't like to whipsaw down. Obviously, we can react to both sides of that environment, but we like the consistent, stable execution in programs. We haven't had a rig lineup or significantly increased the frac spreads. We're operating within a pretty efficient frontier range where one frac spread can handle three to four rig lineups. That's improving with the technology, and we want to be improving with that as well. So I think we have a lot of flexibility, we have a lot of inventory and deep, diverse inventory. We've got a lot of choices and options.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nAs I said in one of my comments earlier, that it's really the best place and the strongest portfolio we've ever had as a company.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions at this time. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome to all of you. 2024 marked a year of transition for CGM. We initiated considerable change. With our new CEO, we were fully focused on enhancing customer centricity, operational excellence and innovation for the benefit of our customers. Enhancing our product portfolio is an ongoing focus. The acquisition of Pridok strengthens our excellent market position and creates the opportunity to offer a purely web-based solution to customers in Northern Europe. With the acquisition of AmbulApps, we enhanced the organization, digitization and structured collection of patient data. In France, we acquired our sales and service partner for 25 years, CPS Concept, thus strengthening our sales and distribution capabilities.\nLooking back at last year, we also focused on IT security. The C5 attestation we received is a testimony to the progress we have made. Once again we have proven our innovative strength with further milestones of launching AI and cloud-based solutions like the AI-driven phone assistant CGM ONE or CGM STELLA supporting our ambulatory and pharmacy customers. We remain fully committed to our purpose: nobody should suffer or die because at some point medical information was missing. This purpose is more relevant than ever. In several of the countries we are present, medical data is now becoming available through connected products and AI modules in order to prevent patients from suffering or dying. At CGM, this is what drives every one of us to contribute to advancing health care and we aim for adding a new dimension to health care.\nLeveraging our robust platform strategy and an unrivaled presence across 19 countries, we aim to engage our current customers, attract new ones and ultimately inspire, support and advance the market for digital health solutions. This strong foundation built on over 35 years of experience in the health care industry is further enhanced by the integration of artificial intelligence and data-driven solutions allowing us to make a significant positive impact on the world. Every day the employees of CompuGroup Medical work with passion to develop new innovative solutions for the benefit of our customers. At CGM, we are committed to supporting health care providers, the everyday heroes who play a vital role in patients' lives; including doctors, dentists, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, nursing staff and the entire medical team.\nWe recognize the significant responsibility we carry and are dedicated to delivering optimal solutions that enhance the quality of medical care, alleviate the workload of health care professionals, ensure patient safety, protect medical data and drive advancement in health care through digital innovation; all while addressing rising cost. The digitization and continuous evolution of technology have fundamentally changed how medical information is accessed, managed and shared. We embrace the challenge of navigating these changes and are resolute in our commitment to remain at the forefront of this ongoing transformation. For more than 3 decades, we support our customers in health care with software and IT solutions backed by the founding Gotthardt family. For the next phase of CGM's development, we have found a second anchor investor and strategic partner.\nIn December 2024, CompuGroup Medical entered into an investment agreement with CVC Capital Partners. The investment agreement was subject to the successful closing of a tender offer launched by CVC offering EUR 22 to CGM shareholders. In January we, the Managing Directors as well the Administrative Board and the Supervisory Board, published a joint reasoned statement recommending shareholders to accept the offer. After the first 3 weeks of the new year 2025, CVC exceeded the minimum acceptance threshold of 17%. After the successful closing of the tender offer, which still depends on several regulatory approvals, a delisting offer is planned most likely during the second quarter. As already announced in the offer document, our Annual General Meeting will be postponed probably to August 1, 2025. As a result of the voluntary tender offer, CGM's shareholder structure has changed considerably.\nThe majority stake held by the Gotthardt family and associated shareholders remains unchanged at over 50% while the free float has fallen below the mark of 25% due to CVC's almost 22% stake. To deliver against our purpose, we are determined to continue investing on a high level going forward. CVC is fully committed to support our strategy of innovation growth in the envisaged partnership. With CVC's deep health care and software expertise, strong commitment and global network; this potential partnership will provide the support and the resources to catalyze the next phase of innovation, growth and transformation in health care. Now let's take a look at the financial performance of 2024. Two days ago we announced; and we means the Managing Directors, the Administrative Board and the Supervisory Board; that the dividend will be the legal minimum dividend this year amounting to EUR 0.05 per share.\nThe proposal comes against the backdrop of the company's long-term innovation and growth strategy, including investments in infrastructure and resources for greater customer centricity and AI-based processes and products. Based on the consolidated financial statements, it also takes into account the revenue and profitability development in 2024 financial year in accordance with the revised guidance. With this decision, we are focusing on customers and employees. Looking at the organic revenue development in 2024 year-over-year, we were down by 2% thus ending the year within the guidance range as revised in July 2024 after the ad hoc announcement. As we said back in July, this development has been attributable to the one-off revenues which have declined. Recurring revenues grew by 5% and exceeded the guided goal of a share between 65% and 70% by 4 percentage points.\nAdjusted EBITDA was down year-on-year and ended up with EUR 225 million within the revised guidance range. The margin was 3 percentage points below last year at 19%. Free cash flow exceeded the revised guidance and stood at EUR 66 million. Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 1.27 below the revised guidance range due to higher tax payments. Let's take a look at the quality of revenues over the past couple of years. Recurring revenues have grown with a CAGR of 8% over the past couple of years. As I already mentioned, in 2024 recurring revenues have grown by 5% and they now account for almost 3/4 of total revenues. As we already explained during the last year, the main reason for the revenue decline lies in the development of the one-off revenues, which we have seen a slower progress of -- where we have seen a slower progress of projects in different areas in 2024 while we had very strong onetime revenues in 2023.\nFor the group and for all 3 operating segments, it is an identical picture. Onetime revenues are down year-on-year, but represent the smaller part of the overall business. On the other hand, we see continued growth in recurring revenues in the group and in all 3 operating segments over the prior year, a strong proof point of the resilience of our business model. Now let's go into more financial detail starting with our AIS segment where we recorded a revenue decline of 5%, which is due to the decline in onetime revenues. The reason for the decline in onetime revenues is mainly the high levels in the TI business in 2023 as well as slower module sales across the board. Recurring revenues increased by 3% and now account for 76% of segment revenues. The adjusted EBITDA in the AIS segment was impacted by ongoing investments in product innovation and decreased by 15% with a margin below prior year.\nComing to our hospital segment. Revenues slightly grew by 1% year-on-year. The revenue growth is attributable to growth in recurring revenues. One-off revenues came in lower due to tough comps with large project rollouts in Germany and Poland in 2023. Against this backdrop, the growth in recurring revenues was able to compensate the strong prior year's development. The continued investment into larger projects and G3 technology lead to a slightly weaker EBITDA margin. Finally, let's talk about our pharmacy segment. In 2024, the PCS segment was also up against tough prior year comps where the segment benefited from onetime revenues especially in the hardware business. The strong development of recurring revenues offset the decline in one-off revenues. Overall, revenues in the segment were on the prior year level. As usual in this segment, the margin stood strong at a level above 30%.\nIn the prior year 2023, the margin was positively influenced, among other things, by research and development grants in Italy and Germany. Now let me give you a short update on the R&D development. The investments in our future-oriented product portfolio and innovative solutions are a key to sustainable success and an accompanying improvement in the work of our customers. In 2024, R&D expenses showed a slight increase while R&D CapEx is below the prior year level. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue remain high at 22%. Let's move on to the free cash flow. At EUR 66 million, free cash flow was below prior year level, but better than anticipated. Due to the decline in one-off revenues, payouts for restructuring and higher than expected tax payments already mentioned in the summer, free cash flow was below the prior year. But we see an ongoing improvement in our working capital management, which supports us on our path.\nTalking about finance. We are recording a leverage above 3x EBITDA of the last 12 months. Net debt has increased from EUR 703 million to EUR 773 million. This includes the share buyback program in early 2024 as well as acquisitions during the last year. At the same time, we remain well financed with more than 80% of our net debt protected against higher interest rates. On the next slide, you find the guidance for the full year 2025. The organic revenue development is expected in a low to mid-single-digit percentage growth range. We expect a continued positive development of recurring revenues with light growth year-on-year. Looking at the adjusted EBITDA, we expect to return to the growth path again after this year of transition supported by at least slight organic revenue growth within each segment.\nWith that, thank you for your attention. I'm now looking forward to your questions and I'm handing over to the operator for the Q&A session.",

My name is Liz, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During the question-and-answer session, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Liz, and welcome everyone to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; and Kirk Johnson, Senior Vice President of Global Operations.\nRyan and Bill will kick it off with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the Investor Relations website. Second, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings.\nWe will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. Third, when we move to Q&A, we'll take one question per caller. With that, I will turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. It was another busy quarter for the company. We continued to execute on our returns-focused value proposition. We announced a 34% increase in our ordinary dividends starting in the fourth quarter. We announced the planned acquisition of Marathon Oil, and we further progressed our global commercial LNG strategy. Now, starting with results, we delivered record production in the second quarter with strong contributions from the entire portfolio.\nIn the lower 48, we still expect to deliver low single-digit production growth in 2024 at a lower level of capital spending relative to 2023. Internationally, production continued to ramp up at Surmont 267 and the Montney in Canada, Bohai Phase 4B in China, and four subsea tiebacks in Norway. We continued to make strong progress at Willow and on our LNG projects at Port Arthur and Qatar. Now, shifting to commercial LNG, we recently signed two additional long-term regasification and sales agreements to deliver volumes into Europe and Asia, both of which will start in 2027.\nWith these agreements, we have now secured just under six million tons per annum of volume placement for our offtake commitments. And we continue to work new offtake and placement opportunities as we look to expand our commercial LNG portfolio up to 10 to 15 million tons per annum in the coming years. Now, regarding our planned acquisition of Marathon Oil, we remain very excited about this transaction, and integration planning activities are underway to ensure a seamless transition upon close.\nThe Marathon Oil shareholder vote has been set for 29 August, and we are working through the FTC's second request that we received in mid-July. We still expect to close the transaction late in Q4. On return of capital, we remain committed to distributing at least $9 billion to shareholders this year on a standalone basis. As we said back in May, we will be incorporating our VROC into our base dividend starting in Q4, representing a 34% increase in the ordinary dividend.\nConsistent with our long-term track record, we are confident that we can grow this dividend at a top quartile rate relative to the S&P 500. Finally, as we previously announced with the Marathon acquisition, we will be increasing our annualized buyback run rate by $2 billion upon closing, with a plan to retire the equivalent amount of newly issued equity in two to three years. So, to wrap up, we're pleased with our operational execution, and we are looking forward to closing the Marathon transaction later this year.\nNow, let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our second quarter performance and 2024 guidance in more detail.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, thanks, Ryan. In the second quarter, we generated $1.98 per share in adjusted earnings. We produced 1,945,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing 4% underlying growth year over year. And this includes the impact of 18,000 barrels per day of turnarounds. Lower 48 production averaged 1,105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 748,000 in the Permian, 238,000 in the Eagle Ford, and 105,000 in the Bakken.\nAlaska and International production averaged 839,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, also representing roughly 4% underlying growth year over year, excluding the Concho acquisition effects. Now, this highlights the benefits of our diversified global portfolio. Moving to cash flows, second quarter CFO was $5.1 billion, which included over $300 million of APLNG distributions. Working capital was a $100 million headwind, which was lower than our guidance of $600 million, as the expected timing of some of our tax payments shifted into the third quarter.\nCapital expenditures were just under $3 billion. We returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $1 billion in buybacks and $900 million in ordinary dividends, and VROC payments. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.3 billion and $1 billion in longer-term liquid investments. Now, turning to guidance, for the third quarter, we expect production to be in a range of 1.87 to 1.91 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is inclusive of the 90,000 barrels per day of turnaround impacts that we discussed last quarter.\nThe primary driver of that is our once-every-five-year turnaround at Surmont, which will impact production by about 50,000 barrels per day during the quarter. For the full year, we have raised the midpoint of our production outlook, reflecting strong second quarter results. Our new range is 1.93 to 1.94 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which implies roughly 3% underlying growth year over year. Our full-year turnaround forecast continues to be about 30,000 barrels per day.\nOn income statement guidance items, we have lowered our DD&A guidance to a range of $9.3 to 9.4 billion, and we have lowered our annual after-tax adjusted corporate segment net loss to a range of $800 to 900 million. Now, these decreases are partially offset by higher forecasted adjusted operating costs, which we now anticipate to be in a range of $9.2 to 9.3 billion, primarily due to increased transportation and processing costs, and inflationary pressures in the lower 48. For CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $11.5 billion.\nNow, this reflects strong progress on our Willow scope for the year, as well as some additional capital allocated to Lower 48 partner operating activity that has highly competitive returns. On cash flow, we are increasing full-year guidance for APLNG distributions by $100 million to $1.4 billion, and we expect $400 million of these distributions in Q3. Additionally, we're going to have a $100 million pension contribution in Q3. Finally, regarding working capital, we anticipate a $500 million outflow based on the tax payment shift I mentioned from Q2 to Q3.\nAnd as a reminder, guidance excludes the impact of pending acquisitions. So, in conclusion, we continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives. We remain focused on executing our plan for 2024. We are committed to staying highly competitive on our shareholder distributions, and we're progressing towards closing the Marathon transaction.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it back over to the operator to start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one again. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question will come from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, Ryan, and team. Thank you for taking the time. My question is just around equity buyback. So, if you could just talk about the share repurchase strategy and remind us, you know, between now and August 29, you're probably going to be out of the market, but your commitment to come back in the back half of the year and get to that over $9 billion at or above the $9 billion capital return number. So, your perspective on taking advantage of some of the volatility and as you plan for the back half as it relates to share repurchases?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Neil, we're very confident in at least $9 billion in distributions for the year. If you look at things, we've paid out about 40% of CFO in the first half of the year, and that's despite having some restrictions on open market repurchases that are related to the Marathon transaction that we've had in place since May. So, as you look at things, as a result of those restrictions, our $4.2 billion in distributions in the first half, that's a bit below a $9 billion annualized run rate.\nBut as you know, the proxy is now mailed out, and with regulatory requirements that we have in place, we're restricted from buying back any of our shares until that Marathon shareholder vote. But that is just right around the corner. That's August 29. To answer your question, once the Marathon shareholder vote's complete, you should expect us to be leaning into buybacks. We think that's really important because we've consistently been one of our largest buyers of stock every quarter. You can run the math on that. It's pretty straightforward.\nThat's at least $3 billion of buybacks that you should expect through Q3 and Q4. That would put us really right in line with our long-term track record of retiring about 5% of our shares on an annualized basis that we've had since the strategy reset. Then, as Ryan reiterated in his comments, once we close Marathon, we expect to be increasing our annualized buyback rate by $2 billion. That would put total annualized distributions at a run rate above $11 billion, inclusive of the base dividend increase slated for Q4.\nSo, yeah, leaning into buybacks as we go through the remainder of the year, and really quite a little bit of things to be looking forward to. Pretty excited about.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nAnd Neil, I would add that, you know, look, the share price has been frustrating to watch, you know, through the first half of the year. We get it. We've been out of the market due to the Marathon transaction. I would just remind everybody that, you know, the shareholders come first in our value proposition, and that's been consistent since we reset in 2016. You know, we retired over 400 million of our shares over that period of time, and I think the average price per share that we've purchased is somewhere in the $70 per share price. So, it's been. The program's been managed really well.\nIf you look at cumulatively, our return of capital over that period of time from 2017 through what we expect to do the end of this year, that's, you know, nearly $57 billion of capital has gone back to our shareholder over that period of time, representing about 45% of our market cap today. So, with the, and why we're excited about the Marathon transaction is there's just going to be, we're going to be bigger, but we're going to be better.\nAnd we're going to have more free cash flow, and we're going to have more funds to distribute back to our shareholders, and we'll retire the shares, as I said in my opening comments, you know, in two to three years, just, you know, based on our plans as we see it today. So, you know, this is a, this is an important question. It's probably got some undercurrent around the share price performance, which we're not pleased with as well, but we're determined to be back in the market as soon as we can and buy back the shares to hit our return to capital target for 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Doug Leggatte with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSorry, guys, trying to turn off the mute button. How's everybody doing, Ryan? It was good seeing you a couple of weeks ago. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess I got done out of a question last time. So, I'm going to stick to one, but I want to make one comment very quickly, and that is that, you know, market recognition of value, Ryan, flows through the dividends for companies of your size. So, I commend you on your decision, on the dividend decision, and I think you only have to look at CNQ to see what I'm talking about.\nSo, congratulations on making that decision. My question, however, is on the deal you announced while I was out, and more importantly, the tax benefits that I don't think were really fleshed out on the Q&A. Marathon has a lot of legacy NOLs, and what I'm trying to understand is how you use that and whether or not that was incorporated into your risk view of synergies, and if not, what that could look like ultimately in terms of value.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure. Hi, Doug. This is Bill. Yeah, Marathon had, what, $2.8 billion of NOLs as of the end of year last year, of 31 December 2023. That's a tax-effective value of about $600 million. And we certainly expect that Marathon will be using a portion of those losses in 2024 prior to closing. But as you point out, that this is a stock transaction, as such, we'd be assuming Marathon's tax basis in its assets, as well as any of those net operating losses that they have, or NOLs. And so, just as a reminder, we're in a full tax cash-paying position right now.\nAnd at today's pricing, we would expect to be able to use any remaining NOLs within the first three years or so. And so, what I think is important about this is that we don't consider NOLs as synergies. We tend to think about synergies as things that we're going to be taking action on. So, we didn't bring the NOLs up as part of the deal announcement, but yeah, tax benefits are certainly something we consider as part of this transaction.\nThey are real value. And Doug, Susandi, and as Bill mentioned, you know, we didn't include the NOLs as part of our synergies, but in terms of the synergy, you know, things are progressing really well there too. You know, we remain very confident of achieving that $500 million synergy run rate within a year of closing, and we see upside to that number. So, our activities are now progressing well. As we mentioned previously, you know, we expect this to be a pretty seamless integration. We've stood up our integration teams.\nThey're focused on reviewing the organizational structures and systems so that we can be ready to close, you know, as soon as we get the go. There are some obvious, you know, G&A synergies, primarily focused on the back office support, you know, the corporate function duplication, as well as system integrations. You know, the other synergies that we're looking at are on the operating cost side of things. You know, there's clear adjacency of the operating areas, which is going to lead to efficiencies such as improved productive time of our field staff.\nWe're also going to be able to rationalize the field office. And then on the capital side, we've been really digging in here too. We've worked the cost-saving opportunities, you know, from several angles here. A couple of examples would be, you know, our ability to run the consistent program of scale is going to drive savings. You know, as we look deeper, we see opportunities to bring the use of our super zippers and remote frac operations to the Montney Eagle Ford position.\nSo, you know, on the synergy side of things, you know, we're progressing really well. We're going to be ready to go day one as soon as the transaction closes.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nAnd I'd say, Doug, I'd add just one last thing. I appreciate your comments on the dividend. Look, I'm probably the holdout on the team, given the history and having to make the decision back in 2016. But look, the company's gotten a lot bigger. We've gotten a lot better, and we've gotten a lot. We've lowered our cost of supply, have dramatically more resource, more free cash flow, more cash flow at lower prices. As we've lowered our sustaining capital as well. Balance sheet's in great shape.\nSo, it all lent itself to doing the dividend action that we're going to do in Q4, consistent with the close of the Marathon transaction to your earlier comment. And lastly, on the, you know, we do this integration really well. Just look at our Concho experience, the Shell experience. We'll do this one really well, and we will overdeliver on the synergies.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. My question's around LNG, and I'd be interested to hear about, you know, how your strategy is evolving, specifically your recent regas agreement at the Zeebrugge and the Asia agreement. You know, how are you thinking about regional targeting and contracting on the future takeaway to get to that 10 to 15 that you've stated out there?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey, Scott and It's Andy, I can take that one. As you mentioned, yeah, we have made further progress on marketing our LNG. We did secure 0.75 MTPA of regas capacity at the Zeebrugge terminal in Belgium. And then we also entered into a long-term sales contract with an Asian buyer for approximately 0.5 MTPA. So, these recent placements take our total now from the 4.5 we previously communicated to 6 MTPA. As a reminder, two of that is in support of the SPAs we have with Qatar.\nNow, for competitive reasons, we don't talk too much about in advance, you know, where we're developing offtake sources or regas capacity. But, you know, as you can see from this quarter, you know, we're making really good progress on both fronts. As we previously communicated, you know, over the long term, 10 to 15 MTPA would be a good range of capacity for us. At that size, we can achieve the full benefits of scale really across our organization.\nSo, you know, I think we're really happy with the progress we've made this quarter, and I think everything's on track for what we're trying to achieve here.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Betty Jiang with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of US Integrated Oil and E and Ps, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, I want to ask about the upward movement in CapEx to the upper end of the guidance range, which was specifically attributed to Willow and then the non-operated activity. Can you give us an update on how Willow is tracking versus your plan, and is that responsible for most of the increase in the budget?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nSure, Betty, this is Andy. Maybe I'll start by just sort of clearing sort of the total guidance, and then Kirk can take your Willow question, you know, directly. You know, we initially set a guidance range of $11 to $11.5 billion at the beginning of the year, and that included a number of uncertainties, including Willow. You know, we now have wrapped up a successful winter construction season, and we're halfway through the year. We now have a line of sight of achieving the scope of work at Willow of around $1.5 to $1.7 billion this year.\nAny large projects such as Willow, you know, achieving scope and milestones on time or early in the first few years is really quite critical. It sets the foundation for us for success and de-risk our project execution. And then I said the other area we specifically called out is the Lower 48. Now, there are a couple of moving parts here. You know, we see an increase in our partner operator scope, and specifically here, you know, when we're balancing on attractive low-cost supply opportunities by partners, we're going to participate.\nAnd then also on the operating side of things, you know, we are seeing more wells as a result of our efficiencies. So, both the partner operator activity and the efficiencies, you know, they're going to provide us some production benefit in 2025. So, when we think about it, we're pleased with the scope of work we've achieved so far this year, and then the scope we've locked in for the second half. Now, given we're halfway through the year, we're now comfortable guiding that capital for the total year is going to be about $11.5 billion.\n\nKirk Johnson\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nAnd Betty, this is Kirk, and I can give a little bit more color here on Willow specifically. Certainly, as Andy spoke to, our strong execution and the accomplishments that we've realized here in the first part of this year just continues to give us a strong view of what Willow capital will be here in 2024. And that's why we're moving into this $1.5 to 1.7 billion range. Again, it's just a function of really strong execution across our workflows, and that is, of course, factored into our total company guidance.\nOn any large projects such as Willow, achieving our scope and our milestones across the full suite of workflows, from engineering through fabrication and construction, all the way through supply chain in these first few years, especially having just taken FID here late last year, it's just critical, and this sets the foundation for our success going forward as a project.\nCertainly, as you heard from me last quarter, our winter construction season here in 2024 wrapped up, and we were able to achieve all the critical scope that we had planned here despite some pretty challenging weather that caused some early delays, but ultimately we were able to get all of that critical scope completed. You know, on fabrication, the largest of our operations center modules we completed ahead of schedule. Those modules shipped, and they've now actually arrived in Alaska, and we have plans to offload from barge to shore here this month in August.\nEngineering's also on track, and when we couple up the fact that we're just doing really well on engineering as well as, you know, wrapping up these operations center modules a bit early, it's allowed us and our contractors to roll directly from fab to the op center modules into the central processing facility modules. We're able to do that actually a couple of months better than planned, which just puts us in a strong position as we set this foundation for the large project. In fact, we cut steel here just last month in July.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nSo, I'll wrap it up by, again, just reinforcing, you know, this first year post-FID is important, and it's also important in procurement. All of our major facility contracts have been landed, and equipment orders, and in fact, we're now at a place where we can say 80% of our total facility spend is wrapped up within contracts, and we continue to make progress on that here as we move into the second half of the year.\nSo, again, across all the workflows, just hitting these milestones early is really important, and it gives us a lot of confidence to reinforce our prior guide on total project capital, and we're still on track for a 2029 first oil.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nAnd Betty, I would step back to sort of very high level, a couple of comments on my side too. You shareholders should want us doing this. This is de-risking the big project, as Kirk described, and on the extra OBO work that Andy talked about. Look, our choice is to cut back our operating program to hit some capital number for the year, and that's not a good decision either.\nSo, rather than cut back an operating program just to cover for additional billings we're getting from other operators, it doesn't make a lot of sense to us given the cost of supply of those opportunities. So, we're wanting to fund both of them at this stage.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Wonder if we could just follow up on that last comment, Ryan, in terms of activity in the Lower 48. So, it sounds like a combination of more OBO and also maintaining your program. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the leading edge of service cost? And I appreciate that that probably, you know, doesn't show up in the high-level numbers in terms of the second half of this year, but if you could foreshadow kind of what you're seeing on the leading edge and what that could mean for 2025.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nMaybe I'll just start that, and then Nick can talk to the details of Lower 48. So, you know, in terms of inflation and deflation, as we previously communicated, you know, we're seeing a bit of a bifurcation this year with Lower 48 seeing deflation while ANI is experiencing some inflation. Now, I'd say right at the margin, you know, we're seeing slightly more deflation than we expected in the Lower 48, while ANI is slightly higher than expected. But that's right at the margin.\nYou know, overall, our full year expectation is still in the low single-digit annual average deflation company-wide as we previously guided. And I'll let Nick provide a bit more color on the Lower 48, but, you know, industry-wide, you know, what we're seeing, you know, we've seen a 20% drop in rig and frac activity over the last 12 months driven by efficiency gains and activity reductions. And, you know, those efficiency improvements are still resulting in higher production.\nSpecifically to the Lower 48, you know, we are seeing high single to low double-digit deflation in some of our key spend categories.\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP of Lower 48 and Global Health, Safety and Environment, ConocoPhillips\n\nYes, Steve, yeah, this is Nick. Just a little more commentary. You know, for the first half, we've seen continued deflation around pumping services. The prop, and there's an oversupply of prop in out in the Permian, so we're seeing some price reduction in there. We think that'll continue into the second half. And we spoke about OCTG as well. We see that'll probably continue in the second half as well. We'll probably see a little bit of curtailing or decrease in deflation in the second half going into 2025 because we've seen fairly large gains over the first half of 2024.\nBut overall, you know, we're capturing that. And when you look at Lower 48 general, we'll have a full run rate if you look from July through December. We'll capture that deflation. That's where we see the fact that our 2024 budget is modestly lower than 2023, primarily driven by that market deflation capture.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of John Royall with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. So, my question's on production. I'm just looking at your guidance for Q3 and then backing into the guidance for Q4 from your full year guide. It looks like a pretty steadily increasing profile throughout the year if I add back the turnaround impacts in Q3. And I think that's in line with how you've talked about the year generally, but maybe you could just give a little color on the moving pieces in production between the different regions as we progress the back half of the year outside of the turnaround impacts you've already called out.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure, I can take that one. And, you know, I think the short answer is, you know, yes, it is pretty steady when you adjust for the turnarounds. You know, we're expecting organic production to grow 2% to 4% in 2024, and that should be pretty consistent across the Lower 48, Alaska, and international. And as Bill said in his prepared remarks, organic production was up roughly 4% year over year in Q2, which is towards the top end of our guidance, again, with a balance across the Lower 48 and A&I.\nNow, if you look at our production profile this year, and I think this is where you were alluding to, is that if you exclude the turnarounds, we're basically growing at 1% each quarter. It's pretty straightforward. You know, the profile though is being masked a bit in Q3 as that's one of our heaviest turnaround quarters in some time with 90,000 barrels/day of turnaround impacts that Bill mentioned in the prepared remarks.\nMaybe just to give a little bit more color on that, you know, that 90,000 barrels is split 50 in Canada, 20 in the Lower 48, 6 in Alaska, 5 in Norway, and then 4 in Malaysia and Qatar. In the Lower 48 specifically, you know, our Q2 actually outperformed our expectations, and we are expecting production to be fairly flat in Q3, and that's due to the turnaround I just mentioned of the 20,000 barrels/day that we have at Eagle Ford. Then we'll be up in Q4 versus Q3.\nSo, you know, bottom line, you know, we're tracking right in line with our guidance just quarter to quarter, to somewhat mask a bit with the turnaround activity that you're seeing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning. Maybe come back on the guidance side on the OPEX front. Obviously, you know, you're talking about cost going up a little bit. You've talked about some of the things on the CAPEX side. I didn't know if those were tied together like higher activity, higher costs. What part of this is, you know, kind of internal versus external? And broadly speaking, what are the inflationary pressures?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nSure, Roger, this is Andy. I can take that one. You know, as Bill mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have raised the guidance to 9.2 to 9.3 for the full year. Now, about half of this is from our Lower 48 non-operated position, and then the other half is our own lifting costs. It's primarily a result of the higher transportation and processing costs, some higher utilities, and some additional workover activity. And we have been experiencing some of these impacts in Q2, and we're now incorporating those into the full year guidance.\nProbably, you know, another point I would make is that as a reminder, Q3 is going to be our large turnaround that I just referred to. So, with that, we will actually see Q3 be the high, you know, the high point of the controllable costs for this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director of Integrated Oils, E and P, Refining and Biofuels, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, thanks. Maybe if I could follow up on the LNG topic from earlier. Congrats on the two announced offtake deals that you have in the LNG business. Maybe can you speak more broadly in terms of what you're seeing on, as you've gone out and marketed the gas, what you're seeing more broadly on appetite and market dynamics for LNG sales contracts, and maybe how you think about global supply demand dynamics over the next couple of years in those markets?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nHi there, yeah, I can take that one too. In terms of what we're seeing, you know, in terms of the offtake side of things, maybe I'll come in from the offtake and the marketing, you know. In terms of the offtake side of it, you know, we're happy with our position, and we, you know, we continue to look for further opportunities, you know, that, you know, have competitive pricing and a high likelihood of FID. The LNG pause is causing some questions from potential buyers on the timing of things.\nYou know, but again, against this backdrop, we've been able to sign two deals this quarter, and, you know, I think that clearly highlights the benefits of our permitted project. In terms of the marketing of the LNG, you know, we remain happy with the demand we continue to see both in Europe, and Asia for new LNG. You know, we're continuing to work, you know, opportunities across the globe, you know, and, you know, there'll be more to come on that as we address them. We don't talk too much about them in advance.\nBut I say, you know, big picture, you know, we remain very constructive on LNG and the role it's going to play. And we're quite pleased with the progress that we're making to go our position out to the 10 to 15 MTPA that we've previously communicated.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is now open.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist\n\nMorning, thanks for the time. My question is on the Permian gas takeaway and maybe Lower 48 realization expectations. I'm just wondering, you all suggest you expect the Permian gas price to remain depressed, and until more third-party pipeline capacity is added. My question is, are you all thinking the pressure could be for several quarters ahead? And, you know, would you all consider curtailing anything until gas rebounds? I know you have mostly oil, so just if there's anything to potentially curtail.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Neil. Yeah, Neil. So, as we indicated on our Q1 earnings call, we expected Lower 48 gas realizations in Q2 to be particularly low. You'll recall at that time Permian Basin pricing was printing negative. That is, in fact, how things played out for the quarter. You saw negative Waha first-of-month and Gas Daily pricing through the quarter. So, yeah, first-of-month Lower 48 realizations were just under 20% of Henry Hub in the quarter. Now, we've got a significant portion of our production is Permian Basin.\nWe've said that we ship to multiple markets out of the Permian, including the Gulf Coast, and West Coast, but a sizable portion of our production does receive in-basin pricing. And as we went through Q2, there was increased maintenance activity in the Permian Basin that put downward pressure on pricing. The basin is pretty constrained right now. Takeaway is fully utilized. Outages are an issue. We would expect that trend to continue into Q3. Relief is really coming later in Q3 with Matterhorn pipeline coming on, adding some significant takeaway.\nWe think that's going to be really helpful for Permian Basin pricing as we look towards the end of Q3 and end of Q4 and should improve overall Lower 48 capture rates as we go forward. The other thing I just note as you look at Q2 and you think about the remainder of the year is that in Q2, not only was Permian Basin pricing low, but a lot of the premium markets were impacted. California border pricing traded at a discount to Henry Hub, which is a bit unusual. You know, inventory levels were high, milder weather was going on.\nI would expect as we go out of the shoulder months and into the fall that that'll resolve itself too. But the big thing we're looking for is additional takeaway capacity coming out of the Permian Basin with Matterhorn picking up. And we've got a little bit of capacity on that. And then to your point about, you know, would you think about curtailing? Well, as we've said repeatedly for ConocoPhillips, this is a pricing issue, not a flow assurance issue. And that's really important because we're primarily investing in oil-producing opportunities in Permian Basin, and we do not routinely flare.\nSo, being able to move that production is important. So, we're a long way away from looking at curtailing oil production, but we are looking forward to additional capacity coming out of the Permian Basin.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with Roth. Your line is now open.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, ROTH\n\nI wanted to just touch base on a couple of your different operating areas from a production perspective. Eagle Ford volumes were up, you know, very, very sharply, you know, this quarter. And you also saw a pretty nice rise in your Canadian, you know, Montney volumes as well. So, I was hoping you can give, you know, a little color around those. I mean, some of the jump in Eagle Ford production, you know, somewhat temporary.\nMaybe there was a lot of turn-in lines and expect production there to moderate, you know, later this year. And also just on the Montney stuff, is that just going to kind of steadily grow? Just trying to get a sense of trajectory on that asset also. Thanks.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Leo, I'll start here. So, on Eagle Ford, you're right. We really encouraged with the production. We hit 238,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus the 197,000 from Q1. Take the group back. You know, we had that frac gap that we had in the second half of 2023, and then we reinstated that frac crew. And so, you're really seeing the benefit in Q2 as we work through that inventory. So, really encouraged with the wells that we placed online into Q1 and in Q2. So, we've seen a strong bump in the production there.\nWells are performing very strong throughout. Now, as Andy mentioned on the turnarounds, we're currently going through, as we speak, a large turnaround in Eagle Ford. That's going as planned, as expected. So, we'll be slightly down on that. That's 20,000 barrels per day impact oil equivalent per day for Q3. You'll expect to have Q4 back up and running. So, really strong performance on Eagle Ford overall.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, and Leo, you asked about Montney as well. You know, we had a really strong start here in 2024, where in Q2, this last quarter, we averaged 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And, you know, I too can take you back a bit. That's more than double relative to same quarter last year. And then we're up quarter over quarter as well, roughly 3,000 barrels a day. And all that's just being driven by us bringing additional wells online as we seek to fill this new CPF-2 capacity, obviously, that we commissioned here late last year.\nAlso, for Montney, our production rates have been in line with our type curve. So, we're really pleased with how we're seeing those wells come online. And we do, in fact, continue to expect to modestly grow our production throughout 2024. Albeit, as you know, and you've witnessed from us in the Lower 48, unconventional profiles, they can be a bit lumpy quarter to quarter. So, I'll guide you here a little bit. We do expect Q3 to be pretty flat to Q2, but then we'll start to see an uptick again here in Q4.\nOf course, you know, naturally, we're seeking to make sure our production remains in sync with this new processing facility and offtake capacity that, having just added last year, you know, again, it's 100 million cubic feet a day of gas processing capacity and an additional 30 in both crude and condensate handling capacity with this new phase.\nAnd so, having brought on the second rig earlier this year, we're just slowly ramping into that new capacity, and we expect that to continue here modestly into the future. So, just again, pleased with how we're making some progress on our wells activities, their performance, and then obviously everything that we're gaining from the experience we have in the Lower 48.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kalei Ackerman with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nKalei Ackerman\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, guys. I'd like to follow up on the gas discussion. You talked a little bit about how your Permian is well set up through year-end. To the extent you can, I'd like to expand on that and talk about how the macro is shaping up through the end of 2025. And longer term, maybe that macro gets a little bit more interesting due to power and exports. So, as you sort of assess that change, wondering if you think your portfolio is appropriately positioned to exploit that kind of macro.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nHi, Kalei. I can take that, it's Andy here. Maybe I'll start with, you know, the demand side of that, and then we can talk about sort of how we might respond to that. So, you know, I think, you know, you've set up the narrative pretty well there in terms of sort of, you know, we are expecting to see tailwinds, you know, in sort of demand for gas. You know, on the LNG side, you know, out of the data center side and transportation needs, you know, just the under-construction LNG plants, you know, are going to add 10 to 15 BCF a day over the next several years.\nAnd, you know, that's alongside the broader electrification trends. You know, there has been a lot of forecasts, you know, I think, you know, we've all seen them on, you know, AI-driven power demand. And they're all, you know, constructive for natural gas demand. But, you know, I do want to point out it's important. There are lots of different factors at play here, such as the pace of those data center buildouts, you know, constraints on the power expansion, you know, and the expected improvement in efficiency.\nSo, you know, we're still carefully working through that piece of the equation in terms of just seeing how, you know, how mature it's going to be over time. But, you know, absolutely, yeah, you know, we do see it driving demand. Then sort of, you know, going to the second half of the question, sort of, you know, what does that mean for us? You know, in terms of our portfolio, you know, we have a lot of gas opportunities in our portfolio that we're not currently developing today. A lot of dry gas opportunities.\nYou know, also, you know, we have a lot of associated gas in our unconventionals, and we could, you know, we could choose to basically target, you know, gassier parts of the unconventionals. But, you know, for us, the bottom line is, you know, it's got to compete on a cost-of-supply basis, you know, where we are today to make the cut for our, you know, our annual capital program.\nAnd the really nice thing about, you know, these gas opportunities is, you know, if the demand is there and the support is there, we can pivot very quickly to the gas in our portfolio if it makes sense and it's competing on the cost-of-supply basis.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nSVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nGood morning, and I'll return to the Willow project. It's perhaps $7 billion of CapEx. It's the biggest project, I think, on the North Slope in the last 20 years. I'll ask some questions that are a little nitpicky to get comfort around the doability of the project. On the facility side of spend, you mentioned the arrival of the operation center. The other pieces of the facility, I guess, are the drill pads and then the central processing facility. What's the design philosophy around those and how do you get comfort that you're in strong control of those?\n\nKirk Johnson\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, hi, Bob. This is Kirk. Yeah, certainly good questions. We've been very proactive in how we've planned this project out over the coming years. And certainly what you're hearing from me is how that's playing out for us, which is it's a combination. Of course, naturally, we're seeking to build as much of these modules outside of the Alaska North Slope where we have pretty challenging weather conditions.\nIt's remote, and it takes a lot of effort and a lot of planning to do what we can do each winter within those winter construction seasons. And so, we've been very purposeful in how we identify areas in which we can aggregate and build these large modules off-site, whether it be in Alaska or in other regions globally, and build those certainly with preferred contractors and partners that can progress those with us.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYou've heard how I've described, we've locked up a bulk of our spend, upwards of 80% of our total facility spend in the fabrication as well as in the construction of all of this, whether it be off-site through the modules. Obviously, we have to work on the transportation, sea lifting those into Alaska. We're still making a few truckables and pieces of work that are appropriate that we can do there in Alaska and exploit the talent and the labor markets that we have in Alaska. And then, of course, we're transporting all of that to the North Slope.\nAnd these are across multiple winter construction seasons, which is why you hear me describe the good work that we had this year. We do actually have expectations of even more work next year in 2025 on the North Slope. And again, that's all weather dependent.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nAnd this is why it's so important for us when we have good weather to knock that scope out when we have that opportunity. And so, we've purposely staged and created this project so that we can get that scope done. We expect to have our peak activity both in fabrication and construction in Alaska across 2024 and the 2025 years. Expect that to stair step down.\nBut again, that's premised on good weather, strong line of sight to our contractors. And so, we just feel like we've got a really strong foundation to how this project's starting just immediately post-FID. So, we're really happy with how all this is looking for us, Bob.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nBob, I'd add a couple other things just from my long-term experience on the North Slope. You know, this is, I don't know, 25th or more drill site that we've built on the North Slope. They're all trunk and lateral designs. They're the same design that we've done on drill sites, you know, for the last, you know, 10 or 15 years. So, we know how to do them. We've done a lot of them, and this isn't any incremental scope. Then on the central facilities, to your question, you know, we've done both.\nWe've stick-built facilities on the North Slope during our winter construction seasons, and we've built them off-site and sea lifted them up. And the important part for Willow was the size of the opportunity there for us and the size and scope of the facilities lent themselves to off-site fabrication.\nAnd I think the team did a great job hitting the window pretty well on the Gulf Coast when there was, you know, ramping down of activity. We could slot our project in pretty quickly, get the good productivity. And then, as we've already demonstrated, our ability to sealift the facilities up to the North Slope has gone really well with the first set of facilities showing up.\nSo, that's an important distinction because a lot is stick-built on the North Slope, but the size of Willow, you know, to us, demonstrated the need to go off-site and build it on the Gulf Coast, take advantage of better productivity and year-round building, and then ship to the North Slope. So, that should give you some comfort. We know what we're doing. We've done this before. And these are just repeats of stuff we've done in the past.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kevin MacCurdy with Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\n\nKevin MacCurdy\n\nManaging Director of PEP Research, Pickering Energy Partners\n\nHey, good morning. To build on the earlier question about CapEx, your first half CapEx was in line, but now you're pointing to that kind of the high end of the range for the year. We would assume that the Willow spend is more geared towards Q4. But when do you see, or when do you expect to see the higher activity in CapEx from the partner-operated activity, and how material is the production impact from that activity?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips",
    "content2": "Yeah, let me jump in here, Kevin. Then, Kirk, if you want to add anything on this as well. Maybe I'll just take you back to the total capital for Lower 48. As Ryan mentioned, you know, we expect capital to be modestly lower compared to 2023, mainly driven by that market deflation. Now, on the operated side, as we've mentioned before, we are fairly flat on rig and frac crew counts. And that's driven by that improved operating capital efficiencies that we continue to realize through 2024, and then we'll have deflation capture.\nNow, on the non-operated side, to your point, capital is higher, as we've seen a higher amount of Permian non-operated ballots than anticipated relative to the 2024 guidance given. So, that's higher activity. And as Andy mentioned, we'll continue to participate in those. Now, these investments are attractive within our cost-of-supply framework and are competitive compared to our operated program. We've seen that through, you know, Q2 especially, and that's why we've raised guidance. We do detailed analysis on all of these as we go through our cost-of-supply framework.\nNow, if I look in the second half of this year, we'll continue to realize the benefit of the deflation. And like we've seen in previous years, that non-op activity typically tails off, you know, kind of the back end of Q3 and then Q4. So, we expect that as well. So, again, just kind of circling back, you know, our capital for the year is just modestly lower than 2023.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nHi, thank you. Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe this is Ryan or maybe it's for Bill. If we're looking at 2025 and 2026, in terms of CapEx, can you share with us some of the moving parts there up and down compared to 2024? I would imagine part of the spending will be way down, but that looks like Alaska may actually be up the spending compared to. So, if you can give us some idea that what is the key moving parts that we should take into consideration.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nHi, Paul.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, hold on, Andy. Yeah, go ahead, Andy.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Paul, you know, you've highlighted a few of the moving parts that we'll have in 2025. But, you know, at this point, it's a bit early for us to be talking about, you know, what the 2025 capital spend is going to be, you know, particularly when we, you know, prior to closing the Marathon transaction. So, you know, I think that's going to have to wait until we get through later through the year and get the Marathon transaction closed before we're going to be wanting to talk in detail about 2025 CapEx.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Josh Silverstein with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nYeah, thanks, guys. Just wanted to get an update on some of the LNG project development. I was curious if the permitting slowdown in the US has actually helped the pace of development at Port Arthur. And then I think it's been about a year since the Saguaro LNG announcement. Just wanted to get an update on that project too. Thanks.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, it's Andy. I can take that one. You know, on Port Arthur specifically, you know, as you mentioned, you know, that is our phase one is a fully permitted project. You know, we've started construction or the operator started construction there with the contractor. And at this stage, I just say things are on track. Really not much else to say, you know, in terms of the construction of the project at this point. You know, it's on track and going as planned. And then I think your second question was, you know, was really on MPL.\nYou know, this one, you know, this is impacted. You know, projects in the US and Mexico, these are impacted by the pause. You know, that is impacting the FID there. But I'd, you know, I'd probably point you to go and, you know, those questions are probably better answered by MPL in terms of sort of the pace of the project and where they're at. You know, we see, like you see, sort of critical milestones being progressed, but they, you know, they face the same regulatory hurdles that the rest of the industry does.\nYou know, you mentioned, you know, you're correct that we have, we've agreed to take 2.2 MTPA of offtake on MPL. So, we're, you know, we're keenly watching the progress there too. But that one is, you know, contingent on the LNG pause.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions at this time. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

My name is Liz, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in the listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During the question-and-answer session, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Liz, and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call today, we have several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Tim Leach, Advisor to the CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Strategy, Commercial Sustainability and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; and Kirk Johnson, Senior Vice President of Global Operations. Ryan and Bill will kick it off with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the Investor Relations website. Second, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\nActual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. We will make reference to some Non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. And third, of course, when we move to Q&A, we will be taking one question per call. So with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our Q1 2024 earnings conference call. It was another solid quarter of focused execution across the portfolio on our strategic plan. Starting with our international projects, we continue to ramp up production at Surmont Pad 267 in Canada, Bohai Phase 4B in China, and three subsea tiebacks in Norway. We expect to start up the fourth subsea tieback in Norway in the next month.\nIn Canada at Montney, production reached a new record level following the startup of the second central processing facility, leading to over 20% growth versus Q4. Shifting to our other projects, we are wrapping up a successful first major winter construction season at Willow this week, and module fabrication is going according to plan. As we build out our LNG portfolio, our Qatar and Port Arthur projects are also progressing well.\nMoving to the Lower 48, our primary focus remains on capital-efficient growth as we continue to improve efficiency in drilling and completions. For 2024, we still expect to deliver low single-digit production growth at flat activity levels with lower capital spending versus 2023. Shifting to return of capital, we remain on track to distribute at least $9 billion to shareholders this year. We announced a VROC of $0.20 per share for Q2, consistent with our guidance of a 60/40 split between buybacks and cash distributions for the year. To wrap up, it was a solid start to the year. We are on track with the full-year guidance that we laid out back in February, which anticipates a well-balanced growth across our global portfolio.\nAs we discussed at our analyst and investor meeting last year, we continue to invest in our deep, durable, and diverse asset base, which will drive significant cash flows and shareholder distributions over the course of our 10-year plan. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our Q1 performance and 2024 guidance in more detail.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. In Q1, we generated $2.03 per share in adjusted earnings. We produced 1,902,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing 2% underlying growth year-over-year. Lower 48 production averaged 1,046,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 736,000 in the Permian, 197,000 in the Eagle Ford, and 96,000 in the Bakken. Now, this included a 25,000-barrel-per-day headwind from weather, which impacted lower 48 production by about 2% and was slightly higher than the 20,000-barrel-per-day guidance provided on the Q4 call. As a result, lower 48 underlying growth was roughly 1% year-over-year.\nNow, for the rest of the company, Alaska and international production averaged 856,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing roughly 4% underlying growth year-over-year, excluding the Surmont acquisition effects. And this really highlights the benefit of our diversified global portfolio. Moving to cash flows, Q1 CFO was $5.1 billion, which included APLNG distributions of $521 million. Capital expenditures were $2.9 billion. Debt retirement payments were $500 million. This was partially offset by proceeds of $200 million from disposition of non-core assets.\nWe returned $2.2 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $1.3 billion in buybacks and $900 million in ordinary dividends, and VROC payments. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.3 billion and $1.1 billion in longer-term liquid investments. Turning to guidance, we've maintained our full-year production outlook of 1.91 to 1.95 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which translates to 2% to 4% underlying growth. For Q2, we expect production to be in a range of 1.91 to 1.95 million barrels of oil equivalent per day also, which represents a similar 2% to 4% year-over-year underlying growth.\nOur full-year turnaround forecast is 30,000 barrels per day. This includes 25,000 barrels per day of turnarounds in the Q2, primarily in Alaska, Norway, and Qatar, and 90,000 barrels per day for the Q3. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, the heavy Q3 maintenance is driven by our once-every-five-year turnaround at Surmont. For CapEx, our full-year guidance remains $11 to $11.5 billion, with a greater weight to the first half of the year. Now, this is due to the $400 million of equity contributions at Port Arthur LNG that are almost entirely in the first half of the year, as we discussed on the last call. For APLNG, we expect $300 million of distributions in the Q2, with no change to full-year guidance of $1.3 billion.\nFinally, for Q2, we're forecasting a $600 million working capital outflow related to tax payments and timing in the US and Norway. All other full-year guidance items are unchanged. We continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives. We remain focused on executing our plan for 2024, and we're committed to staying highly competitive on our shareholder distributions. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it back over to the operator to start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one again. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question comes from a line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOh, hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Alaska. You noted that you just completed the first or are completing the first winter construction season for the Willow Project. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on what was completed this past winter, how it went versus plan, and as we look ahead, what are some of the next key milestones we should be focused on for the Project?\n\nKirk Johnson\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nHi, Devin. This is Kirk. Good morning. Yeah, so we had a really strong start to project execution here on Willow this year. We were actively closing out here this week, actually, our first major winter construction season on the North Slope, where we were able to successfully mobilize over 1,200 workers and were able to successfully build out seven miles of gravel road, 30 miles of gravel paths, and 30 acres of gravel paths for future facilities. We've successfully constructed all of the pipelines that we planned for this winter season. Certainly, in addition, module fabrication has continued to progress really well here this winter and this spring, and we're expecting to be ready to transport the first of those modules to the North Slope here on schedule here mid-year, which is the Willow Operations Center.\nWe still expect to be in the range of $1.5 billion here for 2024. The progress that we're making here this year gives us confidence to keep our estimate on total capital to first production as being remaining unchanged. So we're still in that $7 to 7.5 billion range. And again, that's underpinned not just by the progress that we're making here on construction here this year, both on the North Slope and off-site module fabrication, but we continue to make some really strong progress on our contractual scope. We've landed three-quarters of our total project scope here to date, and we have an expectation that we could be upwards of 90% of our total scope contracted here by year-end.\nAnd so as we look forward here for the remainder of the year, obviously, we're going to continue off-site module fabrication for production facilities, and then we'll continue to ramp up both procurement and certainly prepare for the follow-on winter construction season. So again, great progress here on the Willow Project this year and putting us in a really strong position. We do these projects a lot in Alaska, and it's great to see the teams making the progress they are here yet again this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, team. I wanted to spend some time talking about return of capital. It is notable in the release, you talk about at least $9 billion. Just your framework for thinking about what the right level of return of capital. It is early in the year. Oil prices have been volatile. Gas prices have been weak. But certainly, you have a terrific balance sheet and have the capacity to raise that number. I'd love your perspective on that.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Neil. No, I think we wanted to message, look, we believe we're in good shape with the nine-bay that we described early in the year. I think you look at a reasonable percentage of our cash flow through Q1 of this year, similar to what we've done in years past. We recognize that the price that we're experiencing today is well above our mid-cycle. So our investors should expect well above 30% of our cash flow going back to them. We're monitoring kind of the volatility, as you mentioned, Neil. And again, it's not just sort of in WTI or Brent markers. It's in all the markers, NGL, LNG, and natural gas as well.\nSo, it's a function we just want to see some durability to some of the prices, see where they end the year, and you can expect to get a fair percentage of our cash flow returned back to our shareholders, like we've done over the last number of years.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nHead of North American Energy Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. Ryan, good morning. Can you just comment strategically on the Permian gas and just kind of how you see that playing out? You guys have been really proactive in integrating some of that gas and looking forward, but any target levels you have and maybe just how you're thinking about some of those differentials?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Lloyd. Bill's got some information there that he can share. I think you're right. We've been thinking about this for the last number of years, trying to build out an LNG strategy. And to complement what we're doing on the commercial side, the gas that we move around the Lower 48 to expose ourselves to some of the ARBs that are open even today. So I can let Bill add a little bit more color to that.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure. Good morning, Lloyd. So as we talked about in the past, we ship to multiple markets. We've got transport capacity to the Gulf. We've got transport capacity to West Coast. We're very supportive of off-take capacity from the Permian Basin. In fact, we do have some firm capacity on the upcoming Matterhorn pipeline, but a sizable portion of our volume also is exposed to prices and in-basin pricing.\nWe don't disclose what percentage moves to each location for commercial reasons, but a really good way to think about the company's realizations is as a percentage of capture of first-of-month Henry Hub pricing, that's what we show. Q1, we were about 70% realizations. That was a little bit higher than Q4, so in a good position. And obviously, the Permian Basin has got some transitory issues right now with gas pricing.\nYou're starting to see pricing go negative towards the end of the Q1 and as we go into the Q2. So I think everyone's expecting to see a lot of volatility this year. We certainly expect realization in the Q2 to be particularly low, but these are transitory. As we come out the back of the year with takeaway capacity, we expect that to return to more normal levels. And as you noted, we've got a very sophisticated gas marketing organization. We're moving several multiples of our equity production.\nSo our flow assurance is very good for the company. And we've got access to competitive market pricing. And that flow assurance really is important because we don't routinely flare. And we want to be able to continue to produce because we've got strong return profiles in the Permian, primarily driven by oil.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nEnergy Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks. I'd like to take a look at Lower 48 activity. Obviously, Q1 is down a little bit just because of the weather, but can you give us some color on how you see that progressing through the year? Should we see a nice bounce back in Q2 and then that steady kind of slow single-digit kind of rise through the course of the rest of this year?\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Well, good morning. This is Nick Olds. Maybe I'll take you through kind of the Permian update, Lower 48, what we see. As you noted there, we had the headwinds of weather downtime, as Bill referenced in his prepared remarks. As we look at that, we would have you exclude weather. We'd have about 3% year-over-year of growth there. In addition, we remember we took the operational frac gap at Eagle Ford in the second half of 2023. So we had some impact in Q1 there because of wells coming online kind of the second half of the Q1 time period. Overall, for Permian, we're very focused on just driving efficient operations out there. We've got flat activity with rigs and frac crews. We may bump up quarter-to-quarter.\nI'd also mention that on the first half of our development plan out in the Permian, it's really focused on the Delaware. And then we'll pivot to, on the second half, more oil-weighted towards the Midland Basin, where we've got some of our larger pad projects and some three-mile laterals coming online. Again, Scott, the teams are just, again, laser-focused on capital efficiency, both on drilling and completions. We see good results from the combination of, for example, simul-frac and remote-frac. So we continue to see those efficiency improvements on the operating side for fracs. And then on the drilling side, I think we've mentioned several times, we've got a real-time drilling intelligence group out there monitoring the rigs 24/7. So that's really seeing promise as well. So on the efficiency front, we're seeing that roll through.\nIf you look back as far as taking into account the weather that Bill had mentioned on 25,000 barrels equivalent per day and also accounting for the impact of the Eagle Ford frac gap, you can look at Q1 kind of being the low point for the year around production. We'll see progressively higher production kind of Q2, Q3, Q4. And again, we've got some larger pad projects coming on in the second half of the year in the Midland Basin. So increasingly favorable trajectory on production. All in, as we talked about before, the plan that we laid out was low single digits of growth in that 2% to 4% range.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Betty Jiang with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nBetty Jiang\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nAll right. Thank you for taking my question. Nick, you set that up for me really well because I want to follow up on the Permian and then the efficiency gains that you guys are seeing. We are hearing from other operators significant efficiencies from E-fracs and longer laterals. We'd just love to get more color on what you guys are seeing and how that's tracking versus the corporate plan, and importantly, how that's getting translated into the capital efficiency that you're seeing in the basin relative to plan. Thanks.\n\nKirk Johnson\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYep. Well, good. Well, let's start on some of the longer laterals. I talked a little about previously on the operating efficiency on the frac spreads and drilling. Again, our teams are very focused on long lateral development as we go forward. As a reminder for the group on the phone, if you look at our Permian inventory, 80% of the laterals are 1.5 miles or greater, and we've got 60% 2 miles or greater.\nIf you look specifically at 2024, again, 80% of the wells are 1.5 miles or greater, and about 20% are 3-mile laterals. We've got, as I mentioned before, some of those longer laterals coming online the second half of this year. We see up to that 30% to 40% improvement on cost supply when you move from a 1-mile lateral to a 3-mile lateral. So we're seeing those efficiency improvements out there.\nMaybe just staying on the drilling side, specifically in the Midland Basin, we've had some recent success there, where we've had internal record wells. We look from spud to rig release, so very favorable performance over the last three months. We continue to see that on the drilling side. And the bottom line is it does translate as we focus in on more feet per day, more stages per day, more pumping hours per day. We've seen that 10% to 15% improvement of pumping hours from 2022 to 2023. That all translates to improved capital efficiency and therefore lowering your cost of supply. So it's very encouraging across all fronts.\n\nOperator\n\nA moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning. Maybe Ryan, just get your updated thoughts on the global LNG market. You've obviously got a pretty good footprint. You're expanding it here. Just how you're thinking about it over the next, let's say, two to three years as some of these newer projects come online?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Roger. I'll take a shot and maybe let Andy chime in a little bit as well. But as I said earlier, I think we certainly stepped back a few years ago and wanted to continue to grow our LNG exposure in that position. We know the markets. We have our own technology. We know the business quite well. And we do have a strategic intent to continue to try to grow that. And it's really participating in all facets of it. It's the production side here in North America, in Qatar, in Australia, being in the liquefaction side here in North America and elsewhere, having ships, and being in the regas potential as well.\nSo trying to grow that integrated business as well, even at sort of the lower Henry Hub prices you see today, the ARB is still open to make money and make a decent rate of return as you move some of that LNG to Europe and to Asia. And it's a long-term business that we're interested in. So I can let Andy chime in on a few more specifics as well.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Roger, for the question. I think this is a bit of our business that I don't think is completely understood. It might be helpful if I just put sort of some of the details around it. As Ryan said, if you go back all the way to 2022, we increased our ownership on the resource side by taking more equity in APLNG. Then we've also participated in the two Qatari expansion projects. I think where you were specifically going with your question was on really more from the commercial perspective. On the Gulf Coast, we've secured 5 MTPA of off-take from Port Arthur, and we also have a 30% equity interest there. We've also secured off-take on the West Coast of Mexico with 2.2 MTPA from Saguaro LNG.\nThat one is pending FID and 0.2 MTPA of off-take for five years starting in 2025 from ECA LNG Phase 1. So all in, our off-take in North America is about 7.4 MTPA pending the FID at Saguaro LNG. And switching to the regas side of things, we now have 4.5 MTPA secured in Europe. This includes 2.8 MTPA of capacity at the German LNG Terminal. Now, up to two of that will support our LNG SPAs with Qatar. And we also have 1.7 MTPA of regas capacity at the Gate Terminal in the Netherlands.\nSo over the near term, our focus is on continuing to ladder in the regas opportunities. And over the longer term, maybe think about 10 to 15 MTPA as a good range of off-take capacity to think about. This will allow us to achieve the full benefits of scale across our organization.\nI do want to be clear, this is an off-take ambition. We don't feel that we have to take on additional liquefaction capital. So for competitive reasons, we don't get into the specifics of where we're actually developing off-take and regas right now, but needless to say, that's something that's front of mind for us. So I know that was a lot of detail, but hopefully that helps everyone sort of just frame up sort of the moving parts we have going on on the LNG business.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\n\nNitin Kumar\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Ryan, there's been some news reports saying that linking you to a potential bid on the Citgo refining assets. There were also some articles in Reuters saying that you were considering the sale of part of your equity interest in LNG. I'm not going to ask you to comment on specific transactions, but as you look at the portfolio today and the evolving macroeconomic outlook, are there opportunities for portfolio optimization, and maybe you can comment on a few of them?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks. Say, first, kind of on the Citgo, we're watching that process. Look, we're a creditor in that process. So we're owed quite a bit of money by the Venezuelans. So we're watching that process pretty closely. Look, we're not trying to become an integrated refining or major with refining in our portfolio. This is a way to protect what's owed to the company and the credit that we have against the Venezuelan government. So we're watching that and following that process pretty closely, but that's to get the money that they owe us for the judgments that we have against the Venezuelan government for the expropriation of our assets.\nLook, we're always optimizing the portfolio. I think in the last call, Andy mentioned the acquisition of some APLNG interest a couple of years ago. We secured the full interest at Surmont here in the last year. So we're always looking at opportunities that make the company better. Those were two great opportunities that came along at the right time, and we're in the right place to add to the portfolio. We think about the disposition side. We've sold assets over the last couple of years when they don't compete in the portfolio at our cost of supply thresholds.\nThen the team knows that they need to improve or it moves out of the portfolio. We do that constantly. We don't have any major large disposition programs that we're thinking about inside the company. We just do that as a normal course of business just to improve the company. With regard to Port Arthur, look, we've had some inbounds on the equity interest that we have, and we're taking a look at that, trying to understand what's right for the company going forward.\nAs Andy mentioned in the last question, look, we don't necessarily need to be an equity owner in these things. We wanted to at Port Arthur to launch the project in Phase 1. So we did that. But we're not married to it if the right opportunity comes along. So we continue to look at those opportunities at all. We're in the market every day, and we're trading in the market, and we're looking in the market, and doing things that we think make the company better.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. AI is a buzzword in many other sectors, but we haven't heard the producer talking much about that. But one of the largest oil services companies in their conference call just talked about how they believe their revenue will be up because there's a lot of interest on their product using the AI that will improve the EUR and well productivities. You guys are always on the cutting edge and trying to improve in those aspects in the shale. Can you tell us, that is it being overly optimistic or that within the next two or three years or three or four years, you actually think the AI is going to help you dramatically improve your EUR or well productivity or that this is really much longer term, maybe at some point it will happen?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Paul. Look, I think AI is going to revolutionize a lot of things in our industry, other industries around the world as well. I think Nick, in his response to a previous question, talked about some of the things we're doing on the digital space with the digital, the automation, and some of what we're trying to improve our company and improve our operating efficiency. I can't comment on what somebody else said on their conference call. I think it's going to have an impact on the business.\nI think it goes to things like learning curve and its pace. Look, if we can help optimize and improve our learning curve and get digitized and understand the application of all this deep machine learning to our company, I think it is going to have an impact. And I think about it as acceleration of a learning curve.\nSo it's the pace. It's the pace at which we can optimize and get better and get more efficient as a company. And it cuts across the whole company. It's not just sort of the technical and the operating side of the company, but it's the back office and other places. The challenge is going to be getting this deep machine learning and the supply to an enterprise like ConocoPhillips. Enterprises all around the world. How do you get out of the retail space and into the large enterprise space where you have a lot of data, a lot of data, a lot of visual data, a lot of machine learning data that you have to combine together and to see some of that efficiency? So yeah, it's going to improve us. It's going to make us better.\nWe got to get everybody in the company embracing kind of what we're doing in this AI space.\n\nOperator\n\nA moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks. Maybe just to follow up on some of your LNG conversations from earlier, you clearly talked about there's still work ongoing on the commercial and marketing side and building out some of those kind of things. Is there still appetite to add on the supply side? Qatar announced another LNG expansion in North Field West. Is that the type of thing you'd be interested in, more of that in the portfolio or more supply-side LNG within the portfolio? And then are you seeing signs? We've heard some complaints from others about signs of cost inflation on global LNG projects. What are you seeing as you look at the development of your LNG liquefaction trends across the portfolio right now in terms of cost inflation?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think Andy outlined sort of our ambition to hit 10 to 15 million tons. You add up the volumes that Andy talked about, and it doesn't reach that kind of a level. So do we have an ambition to grow some more in this space? Absolutely, we do. We want to make sure we're in the right spots with the right kinds of opportunity. Certainly, North America is a great spot, both on the Gulf Coast and on the West Coast. If there's some good opportunities, it's about having the best liquefaction fees. It's about the better projects that we see out there. I think when it comes to Qatar, we've demonstrated we've landed a couple of interests in a couple of trains there, NFE and NFS.\nAnd if they put more out there and the terms are acceptable and competitive, we're certainly interested in expanding that relationship with Qatar down the road. We'll have to see when they make their decision on what they want to do with any future expansions out of the North Field. But our relationships are strong, and our participation is strong. I think in some of those areas, we're seeing the execution of Port Arthur is going pretty well. We don't have any concerns about inflation or what's happening there. And certainly watch the market in terms of the liquefaction spend that we have or what future may come. But we're pretty comfortable with it. We're getting into these projects because they're competitive in the portfolio, and they're filling a strategic long-term vision that we have for the company.\n\nOperator\n\nA moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist Securities\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks for the time. My question is around your Lower 48 marketing associated realized prices. Specifically, you all suggest on slide six that your Permian differentials remain maybe a little bit pressured. I'm just wondering, are there any changes you can make on the marketing side to continue to stabilize and improve this? I know you've materially done this, of course, since you bought the Concho assets versus what they sort of just accepted at wellhead. So I'm just wondering, are there further improvements or things that you potentially could do on the marketing side to see even more improvement on the realizations?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Neil, this is Bill. As we talked about, we have offtake capacity both to West Coast and the Gulf Coast. We're interested in additional takeaway capacity on Matterhorn, like I talked about. So we are constantly looking for ways of optimizing that portfolio. Our commercial organization is in the market daily. We're doing orders of magnitude on that production. So we really have a good sense of where volumes are moving and what rates are going. And so I think that the improvement on margins, and as you're looking at that, that's really going to come down to getting additional takeaway capacity coming out of Permian.\nAs we've gone into Q2, you've had some maintenance going on there with El Paso, a couple of other pipelines, and a couple of outages that's putting pressure on Waha pricing. I think everybody's been seeing that. That'll likely clear through the system here as we go through this quarter. The real relief doesn't come until you get additional takeaway capacity here towards Q3 with Matterhorn coming along.\nAt that point in time, I would expect that you're going to see more normal differentials, and you're going to see a return for our portfolio at more than about 80% of capture of Henry Hub across the portfolio. So I think it's a transitory type thing that you're seeing until you get additional pipeline capacity built. I think the important thing here, again, is that flow assurance matters at a point in time where you're constrained in a basin. We've got excellent flow assurance given our commercial capabilities.\n\nOperator\n\nA moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned the new pad at Surmont, 267. I recall under the old operating structure, the partner wasn't that eager about new capital and new technology. Clearly, now you control the pace. Can you talk about that pad? How different is it technologically than some of the older pads, and what are you seeing in early results?\n\nKirk Johnson\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Hi, Bob. This is Kirk. Yeah. First, I'll probably just start out by saying our operational performance this past year has been really strong. And that's important having come through the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in that asset. And of course, we've brought on that new pad. Certainly, as you've heard from us before, first team on 267. It started earlier this year. And then we achieved first oil in December. And we've been seeing a really steady, strong ramp on Pad 267, having started that in December here through Q1.\nProduction for Q1 is up 3 MBOE, and we really have just seen 267 start to grow. And we expect that to continue to offset decline, especially when we normalize that for the Q3 turnaround that we have coming up. Bob, you've also heard from us in the past.\nWe've spoken to the fact that we intend to add about a new pad about every 12 to 18 months, about every year. We just continue to find new efficiencies and new opportunities as we bring that pad online. It's really performing against our expectations. The team spent a lot of time, as we've done a lot of infield work, mitigating base field decline. We've experimented with a number of technologies around our liners. We have prospects of drilling longer laterals here in the future as well. Expect to hear more from us on this front. Certainly, Pad 267 is coming in strong and really just pleased with how this is shaping up and our ability to continue to grow the asset here in the future, having control of it, so.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Alastair Syme with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nGlobal Head of Energy Research, Citi\n\nYeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Can I come back just again to the question of lower gas prices? Because I'm not really sure I understand whether you're making any near-term changes to your capital program. I'm thinking both the Permian and the Eagle Ford here, given that low prices will surely be impacting on near-term cash flow. Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Yeah. Well, certainly, we're not making any capital allocation decisions. It's all driven by the liquid side of the business. I think, as Bill articulated, we need more takeaway capacity out of the Permian to get the Waha prices back up. And we're advantaged a bit because we have El Paso volumes that we can take to the West Coast. They've been in a bit of a turnaround as well, and some maintenance activities going on that pipeline.\nSo there's a dynamic happening in the basin that is impacting Waha prices. So again, as Bill said, getting evacuating your gas is pretty important so you don't go flare because we're not going to routinely flare our gas. We've made that commitment. So having the takeaway is really, really important in these periods of time. And then having the flexibility with your commercial team. We know where we can get a premium price, and we're after that every single day.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Kevin MacCurdy with Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\n\nKevin MacCurdy\n\nManaging Director, Pickering Energy Partners\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the Q1 capital and trajectory. If I remember correctly, you had soft guided to over $3 billion of capital for Q1, but you came in lower at $2.9 billion. Can you bridge that gap for us? And is this lower CapEx the result of just timing, or is there anything structural that could carry forward? Thank you.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Hi, this is Andy. Yeah, I can take that question. It's a pretty simple answer. As you said, we came in at 2.9 for the quarter, which was slightly less than our guidance. That slight underspend was a result of some Willow capital shifting from the Q1 into April. So if you excuse me that timing, our capital spend came in in accordance with our expectations.\nNow, as you look ahead to the Q2, capital is expected to be slightly higher than the Q1, driven by PA LNG and the Willow timing. And then as you look forward into the second half of the year, capital is expected to be lower than in the second half than the first half, primarily due to the $400 million of Port Arthur LNG equity capital spend that rolls off as we go into project financing.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from a line of Leo Mariani with Roth MKM. Your line is now open.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, ROTH MKM\n\nHi. I was hoping you could speak a little bit more to the expected trajectory of your Eagle Ford volumes. I know you had kind of the frac holiday a bit, which kind of impacted volumes in the last couple of quarters. I know they've been kind of trickling down here. I guess, is that over? Do you have more of a normal activity cadence? And should we start seeing growth in those volumes as we roll into the Q2 and the second half of the year?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Strategy, Commercial Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Leo. Yeah, well, just for the group, again, we did take that frac gap, as you just mentioned, in the second half of 2023. That impacted Q4. It also impacted the Q1 of this year because the wells coming online after we reinstated that frac crew came online kind of the second half of this last quarter. So we're not really going to see that until you hit Q2. Again, we took that frac gap because of just the strong operating efficiencies that we're seeing in the fracs versus the drilling side as we apply the different technologies out there. So that's a good thing. Looking ahead just to Q2 and beyond, we expect to see higher production from the previous two quarters as we bring those wells online and have reinstated that frac gap.\nThis is all in line with our full year guidance and is consistent with the production growth that we laid out. Again, that's low single digits in that 2% to 4% range.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions at this time. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call.

On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Tim Leach, Advisor to the CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklin, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Global Operations; Kirk Johnson, Senior Vice President, Lower 48 Assets and Operations; and Will Giraud, Senior Vice President, Corporate Planning and Development. Ryan and Bill will kick it off with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we publish supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the Investor Relations website.\nSecond, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. We will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. And third, when we move to Q&A after the prepared remarks, we'll be taking one question per caller. With that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. It was another strong quarter for ConocoPhillips as the team continued to execute on its commitment to deliver returns to our shareholders. Now, stepping back and looking at 2023, ConocoPhillips demonstrated solid execution across all aspects of our triple mandate.\nWe reported record production and achieved several milestones across our global asset base. We delivered a preliminary reserve replacement ratio of 123%, highlighting our ability to continue to replace reserves across our deep, durable, and diversified portfolio. We're also progressing several key strategic initiatives. We advanced our global LNG strategy through expansion in Qatar, FID at Port Arthur, and several offtake and regasification agreements. We FID the Willow project in Alaska and have been ramping up construction this winter season.\nWe opportunistically acquired the remaining 50% of Surmont at an attractive price that fit our financial framework. We were able to accomplish all of this while delivering our returns-focused value proposition to our shareholders. We generated a trailing 12-month return on capital employed of 17%, or 19% on a cash-adjusted basis. We also delivered on our plan to return $11 billion of capital to our shareholders, which was well in excess of our greater than 30% annual through-the-cycle commitment.\nLast spring, we further strengthened our GHG emissions intensity targets to a 50% to 60% reduction from a 2016 baseline. We were recently awarded the gold standard pathway designation by the Oil and Gas initiative Methane Partnership 2.0. Now, looking ahead to 2024, this morning, we announced a plan to distribute $9 billion to shareholders this year.\nWe also announced a VROC of $0.20 per share for the Q1. The remainder of our cash flow will be reinvested into the business as we continue to execute on our plan to grow earnings and cash flows, as we outlined at our analyst and investor meeting last year.\nIn conclusion, once again, I'm proud of the accomplishments of the entire organization. Our portfolio is well positioned to generate competitive returns and cash flow for decades to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our Q4 performance and our 2024 guidance in more detail.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. In the Q4, we generated $2.40 per share in adjusted earnings. We produced 1.902 million bbl of oil equivalent per day, representing 4% underlying growth year-over-year. This was consistent with our full year 2023 underlying growth rate of 4% also. Q4 Lower 48 production averaged 1.086 million bbl of oil equivalent per day, which represented 9% underlying growth year-over-year. We produced 750 thousand bbl from the Permian, 211 thousand bbl from the Eagle Ford, and 110 thousand bbl from the Bakken.\nFull year 2023 underlying growth for the Lower 48 was roughly 8%. Moving to cash flows, Q4 CFO was $5.5 billion, and this included APLNG distributions of $281 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $2.9 billion, which included $573 million for longer cycle projects. Full year capital expenditures were $11.2 billion, which included $2 billion for longer cycle projects.\nNow, regarding returns of capital, we delivered $11 billion to shareholders in 2023. For the Q4, we returned $2.5 billion. This was via $1.1 billion in share buybacks and $1.4 billion in ordinary dividends and VROC payments. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $6.9 billion, as well as $1 billion in long-term investments.\nIn the guidance, we forecast 2024 production to be in a range of 1.91 to 1.95MMbbl of oil equivalent per day. This translates to 2% to 4% underlying growth pro forma for acquisitions and dispositions. We expect this growth to be well balanced between both Lower 48 and international. Our full year forecast includes turnaround impacts of 25 to 30 thousand bpd, which is about 10 thousand bbl higher than in 2023.\nNow, turnarounds are expected to be concentrated in Q3 when Surmont completes a one-month turnaround, and that turnaround occurs once every five years. For Q1, production guidance is in a range of 1.88 to 1.92MMbpd of oil equivalent per day, or roughly 1% to 3% underlying growth. While Q1 will have minimal turnarounds similar to Q4, it does include a 20 thousand bpd headwind from January weather impacts.\nFor APLNG, we expect distributions of $400 million in Q1 and $1.3 billion for the full year. Now, shifting to cost guidance, we see full year adjusted operating costs in a range of $8.9 to 9.1 billion, representing essentially flat unit costs on a year-over-year basis.\nFull year cash exploration expenses are expected to be $300 to 400 million, and DD&A expense is expected to be in a range of $9.4 to 9.6 billion. Full year adjusted corporate segment net loss guidance is $1 billion-$1.1 billion. For taxes, we expect our effective corporate tax rate to be in the 36% to 37% range of strip prices, and that's excluding any one-time items. That's with an effective cash tax rate in the 33% to 34% range.\nFor capital spending, our full year guidance range is between $11 to 11.5 billion, which includes $200 to 300 million of capitalized interest. Now, on slide eight of the presentation, we provide a bridge from 2023 to 2024 with some of the key year-over-year variables, most of which we've discussed on prior earnings calls.\nThese include our expectation of $200 to 300 million in deflation benefits, primarily in the Lower 48, $200 to 300 million of lower spending in Norway following the startup of our four subsea tieback projects, and $500 to 600 million in lower LNG spending, mostly at Port Arthur. These decreases are offset by a $900 million to 1 billion increase at Willow and a $100 to 200 million increase in Canada to account for the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Surmont and the addition of a second rig in the Montney.\nFor Willow, we expect spending to be more heavily weighted to Q1, and this is consistent with the normal timing of winter construction season. For Port Arthur, we expect that our $400 million of equity contributions in 2024 will also be weighted towards first half of the year.\nNow, as a result, Q1 CapEx could be a bit above $3 billion. So, to wrap up, we ended the year with another solid operational quarter. We continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives across our deep, durable, and diverse portfolio, and we remain highly competitive on our shareholder distributions. Now, that concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back over to the operator to start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one again. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Thank you. And good morning, team. Ryan, I want to ask you about the Lower 48. Last year, you correctly predicted that many of us who thought production was going to be up 4 to 500 thousand bbl a day were wrong, and the number ended up being closer to your number of 8 to 900 thousand bbl a day.\nSo, as you think about exit-to-exit this year, how are you thinking about US oil production? And tie that into your own Lower 48 development plans. How are you thinking about prosecuting that acreage over the course of the year?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Neil. No, we see a bit of the acceleration in the growth rate coming from the US, driven by a number of factors around efficiency and the rig rate. So, we would peg the growth, but we're still growing in the Lower 48. We'd peg that growth at between 300 to 500 thousand bbl of oil equivalent. That's total liquids.\nSo, yeah, we still see some growth coming from the US shale, the Lower 48, primarily driven out of the Permian, but more modest relative to last year's growth. Relative to our expected Lower 48, we're in that kind of same range low to single-digit kind of growth rates coming out of that on pretty much similar activity level to what we entered into 2023.\nSo, at this time, we don't intend to be ramping our program in the Lower 48 and are coming into the year at a similar level to what we exited 2023 at.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks, Ryan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess either thanks, Ryan, Ryan or Bill. I'm not sure who wants to take this one. We'd always been interested to know how you see your portfolio breakeven evolving as it relates to not so much current capital, but sustaining capital.\nWhat we're really trying to get to is that dividend breakeven, that post-dividend breakeven level. If I may, maybe as a part B to that, I'm curious whether cash on the balance sheet benefits or is a priority currently as it relates to how you think about cash returns in that dividend context, given that you're entering a period of elevated spending here for a couple of years.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Doug. I'll let Dominic roll in. He can give you some specifics around the breakeven, but at our mid-cycle price kind of deck, I think it's pretty consistent with what we laid out at AIM, and I can let Dominic give you a few more details to answer that question more specifically.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Good morning, Doug. So, maybe starting with our free cash flow breakeven, I take you back to our analyst meeting last April for our 10-year plan. At mid-cycle prices, we highlighted our free cash flow breakeven averages about $35 WTI.\nThat is higher through the first half of the plan, as you mentioned, as we have the sort of pre-productive capital in the first half of the plan, and then lower during the second half of that 10-year plan as those projects increasingly come on stream. So, that's our free cash flow breakeven. Then for our dividend, you would add an additional sort of $8 to $9 on that right now, so.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. Maybe on the cash on the balance sheet?\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure. We're really happy with where we're at on the balance sheet right now, Doug. So, we exited the year with $6.9 billion of cash and billion dollars' worth of long-term investments, like I mentioned. Our net debt to CFO ratio is in a really good spot. We're at 0.5 turns, and that's post-Surmont.\nSo, we're quite happy where the balance sheet is at right now. And having a strong balance sheet, it's a strategic asset for the company. We continue to view it as such. And that's fundamentally one of the reasons why we feel really good about $9 billion of distributions this year.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, in light of arguably a softer commodity price relative to where we started in 2023.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thank you. Good morning. I guess I'd like to maybe get your thoughts, Ryan, on, yeah, good morning, on the M&A side. Obviously, you did the Surmont thing last year. There's still transactions going on. And just how you think about your cost of supply approach to anything on the acquisition front that's out there, be it Lower 48 or elsewhere?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Roger, appreciate you. There's obviously a lot of M&A activity going on. It's not surprising in our business. We've said that all along that we think there's going to be more even yet to come as we think about the consolidation that's needed in the business. Our approach hasn't changed.\nOur approach is we think about cost of supply. We think about the framework that we've laid out to the market over the last four, five years. That's how we've executed some of our M&A activity. So, again, it's got to fit that financial framework, how we think about mid-cycle price. It's got to make our 10-year plan better. The plan that we outlined to the market last year, we think, is pretty strong, and it's underpinned by a low cost of supply, diverse asset base.\nSo, we got to see a way to make that plan better through any inorganic M&A. And then finally, we got to see a way to make the asset better. And that's really dictated how we've approached M&A over the last number of years. And I think as we think about it going forward, that approach is consistent.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\n\nNitin Kumar\n\nSenior Analyst of US Oil and Gas Research, Mizuho\n\nGood morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Ryan or Bill, I don't know who wants to take this one, but you reduced the cash return target from $11 billion to 9 billion. Last year, it was very evenly distributed between your dividends, both the fixed and available, and the buyback. How should we think about the mix across those three channels in 2024?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. So, first, we think the most important thing continues to be the total quantum of distribution. That's what we focus on. We think that that's what matters most. And we're really happy to start the year with an initial plan to return $9 billion to shareholders. Now, when it comes to the mix, we look at a number of different factors, commodity prices, our own stock price, and other considerations.\nAnd so, for 2024, you've seen that we've shifted our mix to be a bit more weighted towards buybacks, about 60% of our total planned distributions. That would put our buybacks essentially flat with what we spent in 2023 at about $5.3 to 5.4 billion. And we're continuing to like the value of our shares. So, against that, the total cash component represents about 40% of our expected distributions, and that's with $0.20 per share on VROC.\nWe think that represents a really solid mix of both cash and buybacks. As we've always said, VROC provides a really flexible tool to achieve our distribution targets as prices adjust through the cycles. It's continued to serve us well in balancing our mix.\n\nNitin Kumar\n\nSenior Analyst of US Oil and Gas Research, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nHead of US Energy Research, Jefferies\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thanks for all the details so far. Ryan, I was hoping just to get your thoughts on the administration's LNG pause and then, in particular, Conoco's positioning and maybe whether it has any impact on your plans or your capital going forward.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Thanks, Lloyd. I can chime in, maybe ask Bill to add a few more details as well. But it's unfortunate. It's clearly more politically driven than fundamental, but I think we feel pretty good. It just makes us feel a little bit better about what we're doing on the LNG side because of what we do have permitted. I think it's probably short-sighted in the short term. Hopefully, it'll be fixed in the long term.\nBill can provide maybe a few more specifics around how we're thinking about Port Arthur Phase 1, Phase 2 as we think about the implications of what was announced.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure, Ryan. We're really pleased that Port Arthur Phase 1, it's fully permitted. It's got not only its free trade agreement permit, but its non-free trade agreement permit. It's got environmental permits in place. So, we're quite pleased to be investing in Port Arthur Phase 1. We think that actually what you're seeing right now makes that more valuable. And so, it's a good fit in our portfolio.\nWe're continuing to look at developing a diversified portfolio of offtake. We remain interested in a number of LNG opportunities because we think the market's going to be strong for decades to come. We're focusing on low-cost supply, low greenhouse gas intensity resources that meet that transition pathway. And you saw us last year announce 2.2 million tons from MPL at Saguaro.\nIn Q4, we signed 0.2 million tons offtake from Sempra's ECA project on the West Coast of Mexico for five years. We're continuing to look for opportunities that really fit that framework. Regarding your question on permitting right now, Port Arthur is in a great spot.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nHead of US Energy Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, great. So, it doesn't change any plans going forward?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nIt's not impacting us right now.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nHead of US Energy Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Royall with JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. So, my question's on Willow. You have the sanction out of the way now, and even post-sanction, we've seen some news flow around lawsuits, which I assume you have some confidence in as an organization that won't cause any delays, but maybe you can confirm that.\nAnd then beyond that, maybe you can just speak to the construction plan for the year and what you're hoping to accomplish in terms of the progression of the build in 2024 specifically.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey, John, this is Andy. I can take that question. So, yes, it's pretty nice to also be at a point now where we can start talking about the project and not just give you a legal update. But we will, given your question. I'll start with a bit of a legal update because, as you mentioned, we had a fair bit of positive activity in the Q4 on that front.\nSo, just to sort of summarize where we are right now is that we're very pleased that both the Alaska District Court and the Ninth Circuit allowed construction work to proceed on the North Slope. And then separately, the Alaska District Court upheld the legality of the ROD issued by the BLM. So, as you mentioned, this is currently being appealed to the Ninth Circuit.\nBut as we said before, we believe the BLM and the cooperating agencies conducted a really thorough process to satisfy all the legal requirements for them to grant their approvals. So, these positive rulings gave us the certainty to make the FID decision.\nNow then, in terms of the second part of your question on execution itself, since taking the FID, we're really pleased with how quickly we've ramped up the activity. We're now into our second winter construction season on the North Slope. And we're mobilizing 1,200 workers right now who are going to be building gravel roads, gravel pads for the facilities, and beginning laying pipelines. We're also making some pretty significant progress with our modular facility fabrications.\nSo, we do expect 2024 capital to be in the upper end of the previously communicated annual ranges of $1 to 1.5 billion per year. But our estimate for the capital to first production remains unchanged at $7 to $7.5 billion. Now, just to give you a bit more color in terms of the progress, we're now at a point where we have 3/4 of the project scope under firm contract and expect to have 90% of that under contract by the end of 2024.\nAnd of those contracts that we've issued so far, 70% are either lump sum or unit rate contracts. And then these kind of contracts, we've agreed a price now as we have limited exposure to future inflation. So, it's still very early, but like with all major projects, it's really important we get off to a fast start. And we're really pleased that's exactly what we're doing with Willow. But just to wrap it up, it's great to see at this point now our team's in full execution mode focused on actually building Willow.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist Securities\n\nMorning. Thanks for taking my question. My question is more kind of how you're thinking about production growth. You certainly have laid out what I call a stable to flattish plan for the year, for Q1 for the year. I guess kind of two questions around that. One, if you continue to be more efficient as you have been, would you take those savings and plow back to the ground and boost production a bit more, or would those savings go back to the shareholders in some fashion?\nAnd then secondly, a couple of your large peers continue to be growing even a bit more than you and the firm mean. I'm just wondering how you view, sort of from a macro position, your responsibility when it comes to production growth.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Neal, it's Dominic here. I think, I mean, first of all, I think there's probably three questions there, actually. I'll take the activity one. We're holding our Lower 48 activity flat this year versus last year. We like that. We're still seeing some modest growth there. And we're really focused on efficiency there. And so, if we did get more efficient and we felt there was some capital headroom there, I think I suspect that we would pretty much hold things flat because we're just so focused on efficiency. We don't want to swing our programs around.\nIn terms of the total growth rate, remember, growth is an outcome of our plan. We're not chasing growth. It's really an outcome of a return that's focused on returns. And so, we're pretty happy with that sort of modest level growth. It's pretty consistent with what we said at AIM.\nIn terms of the overall profile, just to give you a bit of color on that, I mean, Bill mentioned a lot of this in his prepared remarks, but we do expect sort of underlying production in the range of 2% to 4% growth this year versus last year. The good thing about it is that we're seeing growth this year, not just coming from the Lower 48, but also from across our international portfolio.\nSo, it's nice to see the diversity of that portfolio coming through. Then, of course, on top of that organic growth, we have the additional 50% interest on top of that. In terms of the shape for the year, fairly ratable year-over-year growth by quarter, except for Q1, we have the weather impacts. Bill mentioned that, about 20 thousand bbl a day of weather we'll see in Q1.\nAnd then in Q3, we have our turnaround impacts. So, we have about 25 to 30 thousand bbl a day of turnaround impacts this year. Most of that will be in the Q3. And that includes a sort of month-long turnaround we have at Surmont, which occurs every five years. So, but anyway, we're all very pleased with just where the growth is coming from. We're pleased with the level of growth. And I think we're pretty committed to keep the program steady, stable, and focus on efficiency.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, and I just reiterate, we just don't want to whipsaw the teams either up or down. We just like the constant pace of the execution and find that gets the efficiencies at a maximum, gets our returns, really maximizes our returns.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist Securities\n\nIt's great to hear that, guys. It makes much more sense. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Josh Silverstein with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks, everybody. So, I just wanted to touch on the Montney. This is one of the key growth areas that you had highlighted back in April last year. You mentioned the processing facility started up in the back half of the year as well. I know it's 60% liquids, but how has the lower natural gas price environment changed the way you're thinking about development there?\nAnd along those same lines, I know there's only a small uptick in Canadian spend for the year. I figured that might be related to Surmont more than this. So, any help there would be great. Thanks.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, hi, this is Andy. Maybe just taking the first part of your question, sort of the natural gas, it really doesn't impact our natural gas price. It doesn't really impact our long-term development plans. And then also putting that in context, sort of we have our position in Surmont where we actually are a user of natural gas. So, that doesn't really change our Montney development plans.\nI think in terms of the progress we're making on Montney, we are going to be ramping this year. We've just started the second rig. And just to give you sort of some context of the numbers here, we had in our full year 2023, production was about 24 thousand bbl a day. We averaged 33 thousand bbl in the Q4. And that's what we're expecting that to grow now throughout the year.\nThen in terms of the CapEx, the modest growth CapEx you're seeing in Canada, it is a combination of the additional equity we have in Surmont, but also adding the second rig of the Montney.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYeah, good morning. I was looking at the triple-digit organic reserve replacement ratio and wondering some of the moving parts, and kind of curious what impact did the sanctioning of Willow play on that?\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey, Bob, Dominic here. Yeah, I mean, we're very pleased to see strong organic and total reserve replacement again this year. And we're seeing strong contributions from across the portfolio. So, on the organic side, first of all, Lower 48 is doing well. With the advancement of our resource development plans there, its organic replacement ratio is well in excess of 100%.\nWe've got contributions from Montney. And then the Willow piece, yeah, that's a really strategic piece for us. So, you know the way it works with bookings on major projects. You have an initial booking, and then you book as the project develops. That's normal. So, our initial booking was about 160 million bbl on Willow. So, that's what we book on sanction.\nAnd then as we develop up the development wells and the project, we'll see that approach towards our base case resource estimate of 600 million bbl for Willow. So, yeah, very strong there. And of course, on the total reserves replacement, we add in the A&D, and we get the benefit of about 200 million bbl of resources that came with reserves that came with the Surmont 50% acquisition. So, again, another year of strong total reserve replacement for us, which is good.\n\nBob Brackett\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nVery clear. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the question, and thanks for all the detail today. Maybe a follow-up on Lower 48 capital. There's some deflation that you've called out. It seems like most of it right now is driven by consumables and commodities. But Ryan, you mentioned activity levels overall have cooled significantly over the course of the second half of 2023.\nAnd so, I was wondering where you think we are in maybe the life cycle of this Lower 48 deflationary trend, and maybe if that presents some opportunities to term out capacity and add even more visibility to the spending plan, because as you mentioned, you're not really going to move activity around in different scenarios. Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Sam, I can let Nic follow up on some of the details, but certainly, we look at any opportunity to term out things when we see that opportunity. And I think the service side of the business, I think like ConocoPhillips, because our plans don't change and we have consistent execution and consistent rig counts, frac spreads, and all the other support activity that goes with the business.\nAnd the deflation, it's kind of a tale of a couple of different areas and certain commodities of spend, but I can let Nic chime in specific to the Lower 48 there.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Sam, like Ryan was mentioning, again, you look at our activity level, it's flat to 2023. So, stable rigs, stable frac crews. And the teams are really just focusing on driving operating efficiency, capital efficiency, and then capturing that deflation, as you mentioned, as we showed in the prepared slides there that we posted. And it's going to range across a number of spend categories. So, we've got OCTG, we've got some proppant as well as rig horsepower.\nWe'll look at all of the contracts across our vendors and see if we want to term up. Typically, we're looking at well to well, pad to pad as far as rigs, a little longer-term contracts on our frac spreads, especially the E-fracs. But the key thing for us is really just focusing on operating efficiency and capital efficiency with the level loaded steady-state program that we have in 2024.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks. Maybe if I could ask on a couple of the Lower 48 assets, the yield for production has been declining over the last few quarters in 2023. What's the right way for us to think about direction of production there? Is the goal to hold it flat, or modestly decline, or grow going forward? And maybe the same question for the Bakken.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Ryan, just talk first on Eagle Ford. When you look at Q3 to Q4, we had that 9% production drop. That met our type curve expectations. There's no productivity issues or operational concerns there. It was a conscious decision. As we looked at the second half of 2023, and as we've talked about, the completion efficiencies are actually outpacing our drilling efficiency. So, it's a good problem to have.\nSo, we worked down through kind of our working level of DUCs and decided on the second half of 2023 to take what I call an operational frac gap. So, we built some DUCs in that period of time and then reinstated late 2023 the frac crew. So, it's really intentional, really good performance from the Eagle Ford going forward. Bakken, very similar. We've hit some production records.\nYou think about a legacy asset like the Bakken, and we were hitting 110 thousand bbl equivalent per day. We've got a long list of inventory. We'll have a steady program up there as well.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Alastair Syme with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nGlobal Head of Energy Research, Citi\n\nHi. I just wanted to return to the questions that I think people have circled around a little bit on the Permian. You've mentioned supply chain costs, but sort of wrap it up with efficiency, because I guess last April, you presented these costs of supply numbers that include some forward assumptions about costs and efficiency.\nI just wanted to get a sense of where you think you stand relative to those assumptions. Is the Permian moving up, down, or sideways on your cost of supply? Thank you.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'll first talk about just the overall efficiency assumptions that we have and what we're seeing out in the field. To remind you on both D&C, we continue to see step changes in both the drilling side as well as the completion side. Probably differential on the completion efficiencies, as I just mentioned, related to Eagle Ford. We're leveraging all of the different kind of suite of opportunities to improve those frac efficiencies and drilling efficiencies, I'll just mention a few.\nThe key thing here is that we're continuing to see improvement kind of quarter to quarter, year to year. That manifests itself into essentially a 10% to 15% improvement in our pumping hours per day, year to year. A couple of items that we have out there, we continue to deploy simul-frac across the board, but also super zipper down in Eagle Ford.\nWe've had really good success of this particular application where we can hook up, for example, on a four-well pad, we'll hook up all of the wells. And if we have any operational downtime, we can quickly move from well to well and have high pumping hours and therefore more stages per day. So, that's been really successful. We also remote frac. I've mentioned that before.\nWe've seen good success in that where we don't have to mob and de-mob a frac spread, so we can move on to pad two, pad three without mob de-mobing it. And then finally, I'll just pivot to the drilling side. We've deployed that real-time drilling intelligence group out in the Permian. We've got the entire rig fleet that we're monitoring 24/7, where we can optimize the plan, we can troubleshoot, and we can steer the wells.\nWe're seeing really promising results, 10% improvement in rate of penetration there. Combined through all of that, we are seeing improvement in those efficiencies. Again, 10% to 15% improvement in pump hours per day, as I mentioned on the completion side.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys. Hi.\n\nOperator\n\nMorning, Paul.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThis maybe is for Bill or maybe it's for Ryan. Ryan, you have said that the industry will need more consolidation, and you have proven in the past that you are not shy in doing your share. For the right deal, when you're looking at your balance sheet today, how much you're willing to put on the debt or how much you're willing to stretch your balance sheet from that standpoint, if it is a right deal? Is there a number or a ratio or anything that you can share so that at least we get some better understanding?\nAnd from a balance sheet standpoint, the $9 billion of the distribution for this year, is that a fixed amount or that it will fluctuate based on the commodity prices, either better or worse than your current assumption? Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I kind of stuck in a couple there, Paul, but let me start with the last one first. The $9 billion, as we said in our release, is a starting point. We recognize the commodity prices are pretty volatile, both up and down. And I mean, we've seen WTI approaching $60, and we've seen it approaching $80. So, I think you view the $9 billion as a starting point, and folks should feel pretty comfortable that we're well above our mid-cycle price.\nWe're well above our 30% commitment to return capital to the shareholders. And again, look at our history. So, you should feel comfortable that we'll adjust. It's a starting point for us, and we'll see how the commodity prices go through the remainder of the year. On the second part, look, we consider the balance sheet to be a pretty significant asset inside the company.\nWe will maintain an A credit rating. The balance sheet's strong for the company. We've got a 2.5 net debt to cash. So, we like where the balance sheet is at, and it gives us the cushion in these volatile commodity prices to be able to return the money that we're spending and sending both to grow the company organically, and the distribution level that we're starting with at the $9 billion.\nAgain, on the M&A side, Paul, it's really what kind of opportunities present themselves that have to fit our financial framework. And if they fit our framework and there's something that we can make better, makes our 10-year plan better, we've been willing to execute those. But we'll look at the way we execute those on a case-by-case basis. Surmont, we funded with some debt, but it made sense for that particular asset to do that.\nWe've used cash and other means to fund the acquisition. So, it's pretty hard to say, depending on any opportunities that present themselves, what we might do.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nRyan, is there a maximum that you're willing to add based on a single transaction?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nNo, it depends on the circumstance, Paul. We're not going to stress the balance sheet. So, we've worked hard to get the balance sheet where it's at today. I'm not interested in going back to where we were seven, eight years ago on the balance sheet.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani with Roth MKM. Your line is now open.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, ROTH MKM\n\nHi, guys. You talked about having some pretty decent international growth this year, well above the Lower 48, which obviously is a nice contributor as well. It sounded like some of that's coming from the Montney in Canada. Can you maybe just detail some of the other international growth that you're seeing? I imagine there could be some chunkier projects that might be coming online during the year. So, any color around that would be helpful.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure. This is Andy. I can take that question. We actually discussed this one in a bit of detail on our last quarterly call. You're right, we do have some good momentum on the Alaska and international projects. So, just to give you a feel about where they're coming from across the portfolio, sort of in Norway, we achieved first production ahead of schedule in three of the four subsea tiebacks. The fourth one's expected to come online as planned in Q2.\nIn China, our partner brought the first Bohai Phase 4B platform online in October, and then the second one came on in December. Also, in December, we achieved first oil from Pad 267 in Surmont, and we expect to gradually ramp that up over the coming months.\nAs I previously discussed, in Montney, the start of a CPF2 really has allowed us to start ramping production there in the Q3. We expect to see growth in 2024 in the Montney from the CPF2 and also the second rig. So, we're really happy with sort of the spread we have across Alaska and international with where the growth's coming from. I think, as we said in one of the earlier questions, that A&I is going to be providing a significant part of the total company growth this year.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, ROTH MKM\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have no further questions at this time. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Liz, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During the question-and-answer session, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thank you, and welcome to everyone to our Q3 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO, Tim Leach, Advisor to the CEO, Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dominic Macklon, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48, Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Global Operations, Kirk Johnson, Senior Vice President, Lower 48 Assets and Operations, and Will Giraud, Senior Vice President, Corporate Planning and Development.\nRyan and Bill will kick it off with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the Investor Relations website.\nSecond, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. We'll make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. Before I turn it over, I just want to flag for today we'll do one question per caller. With that, let me turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call. It was another solid quarter for ConocoPhillips as the team continued to deliver strong underlying performance across the portfolio, and we have achieved several additional project milestones in our international portfolio in early October. Now, before I get into the details, I wanted to address the topical news in the industry, which has been the M&A headlines in recent weeks.\nThis is not a surprise to us. We have long said that we expect to see further industry consolidation. ConocoPhillips remains steadfast in our returns-focused value proposition and cost-to-supply principles, which creates a high bar for M&A. As a reminder, we've been actively high-grading our own portfolio over the past several years.\nAs a recent example, we are pleased to have closed on the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Surmont in early October. An opportunity came along to acquire this asset at a very attractive price that fit our financial framework, an asset we can make better through our full ownership, and an acquisition that makes our 10-year plan even better. Surmont is a long-life, low-declining, and low-capital-intensity asset that we know well.\nWe achieved first steam from Pad 267 in Q3, and production is expected to start up in Q1 2024. This is our first new pad addition since 2016. As we said at a recent analyst meeting, we can leverage existing infrastructure to add additional pads with very limited capital requirements in the years ahead.\nNow, moving to global LNG, we've also continued to progress our strategy, securing 1.5 MTPA of regas capacity at the Gate LNG terminal in the Netherlands. This will take our total European regas capacity to 4.3 MTPA. We have now effectively secured destinations for nearly half of our Port Arthur LNG offtake commitment in the first six months since we sanctioned the project.\nNow, elsewhere in the international portfolio, we started up our second central processing facility, CPF2, in the Surmont. In Norway, we just announced that we have started up three project developments ahead of schedule in October. This includes the company-operated Tommeliten Alpha A subsea tieback project at Ekofisk, which is nearly six months earlier than originally planned, as well as two non-operated projects. Finally, in China, our partner started up Bohai Phase IVB ahead of schedule in October.\nAs you can see, our diversified international portfolio continues to be a strong differentiator for our company. Shifting to results, we had record global and Lower 48 production in Q3, and we raised our full-year production guidance to account for the closing of the Surmont acquisition, all this while achieving continued capital efficiency improvements as our full-year capital guidance remains unchanged.\nWe also continued to deliver on our returns to our shareholders. We increased our quarterly ordinary dividend by 14%, consistent with our long-term objective to deliver top quartile increases relative to the S&P 500. We have distributed $8.5 billion in dividends and buybacks year-to-date, and we remain on track for our $11 billion full-year target. We did this while funding the shorter and longer-term organic capital growth opportunities that we see across the entire portfolio. The team continues to execute well.\nOur deep, durable, and diversified asset base continues to get better and better, and we are well-positioned to generate competitive returns and cash flow for decades to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our Q3 performance in more detail.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. In the Q3, we generated $2.16 per share in adjusted earnings. We produced 1,806,000bbls of oil equivalent per day, representing 3% underlying growth year-over-year. Planned turnarounds were successfully completed in Norway and Alaska, and Lower 48 production averaged 1,083,000bbls of oil equivalent per day, including 722,000 from the Permian, 232,000 from the Eagle Ford, and 111,000 from the Bakken.\nLower 48 underlying production grew 8% year-on-year with new wells online and strong well performance relative to our expectations. Moving to cash flows, Q3 CFO was $5.5 billion, including APLNG distributions of $442 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $2.5 billion, which included $360 million for longer-cycle projects. Through the end of the Q3, we have now funded $875 million for Port Arthur LNG out of our planned $1.1 billion for the year.\nRegarding returns of capital, we delivered $2.6 billion to shareholders in the Q3. This was via $1.3 billion in share buybacks and $1.3 billion in ordinary dividends, and VROC payments. Today, as Ryan said, we announced an increase to our ordinary dividend of 14% to $0.58 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $9.7 billion, which included proceeds from the $2.7 billion in long-term debt that we issued to fund the Surmont acquisition, which closed in early October.\nBefore shifting to guidance, I do want to take a quick moment to update about our VROC. Beginning in 2024, we will be aligning both the announcement timing and subsequent payment of our VROC with our ordinary dividend. Therefore, you can expect us to provide details on our Q1 VROC payment on the Q4 call in February.\nNow, turning to guidance, which now reflects additional 50% of Surmont starting in early October, we forecast Q4 production to be in a range of 1.86 to 1.9 million bbls of oil equivalent per day. Full-year production guidance is now roughly 1.82 million bbls of oil equivalent per day. Now, to put this production guidance in context, we expect underlying growth for both the Q4 and the full year to be roughly 4% year-over-year, which includes Lower 48 production growth of roughly 7%.\nThis is very consistent with our full-year guidance and our long-term plan we laid out at our analyst and investor meeting. For AP LNG, we expect distributions of $300 million in the Q4 and $1.9 billion for the full year. While APLNG distributions can vary quarter-to-quarter, a normalized run rate to think about moving forward is around $400 million per quarter at current price levels. Shifting to adjusted operating costs, we raised our full-year guidance by $300 million to $8.6 billion.\nThis was driven by our increased working interest in Surmont, increased Lower 48 non-operated activity, and inflationary impacts in the Lower 48. We've also raised our DD&A guidance by $100 million to $8.3 billion, which is also primarily due to Surmont. Full-year adjusted corporate net loss guidance remains unchanged at roughly $800 million. The second-half run rate is a good starting point for 2024. Finally, our full-year capital spending guidance range is also unchanged. To wrap up, we had another solid operational quarter.\nWe continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives across our diverse portfolio, and we remain highly competitive on our shareholder distributions. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it back over to the operators to start the Q&A.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one again. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question comes from a line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much. There's been a lot of variability in Lower 48 results from some of your competitors, and you guys have been very steady tracking at this 7% growth rate. Just love your perspective walking through the basins, particularly the Permian. What is working, what's not for you guys, and how do you feel about the plan as you move into 2024?\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Neil, this is Nick. You're right. I mean, overall, if you look at our performance across all our basins, it's been strong and in line with prior-year performance across, again, all those Lower 48 assets. I'd also mention that it's been in line with our type curve expectations. I'll call out, for example, Delaware well performance is showing top quartile on volumes produced not only on a barrel of oil per foot basis, but also on a BOE per foot basis. We're seeing very encouraging results there. I think the key point, too, is this strong performance reinforces our strong focus on a returns-capital-efficient environment that we've set there.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nI would add, Neil, it speaks again to the quality and the depth of the inventory in the company. We're prosecuting some of the best acreage in the basin and doing it in such a way that it's focused on capital efficiency and returns, as Nick described. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of John Royall with JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You've had a handful of international project startups that you touched on in the release. If you could give us some more color on these projects, that would be helpful. Maybe if you could tie that into a growth outlook for the international business in 2024 as well, that would be helpful.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, John. This is Andy. I can take that one. It's a little early to be getting into full-year guidance for 2024. As you mentioned, we have had some pretty good news across our Alaskan international projects. We've made some pretty significant progress across the portfolio, and it really is nice to see so many of those projects achieve major milestones on or ahead of schedule and budget. Ryan touched on Norway.\nthere we achieved first production ahead of schedule on three of our four subsea tiebacks. We expect the fourth one to come online as planned in Q2 2024. We expect those four projects in aggregate to add about 20,000bbls a day of production next year, which should more than offset normal declines in 2024.\nWe also had some good news in China where our partner-operated Bohai Phase IVb achieved first production ahead of schedule from the first platform. Now, that's going to be two platforms tied back to a central processing facility, and we'd expect the second platform to come on in Q1. Then with that, we'll then have the opportunity to drill new wells in Bohai for the next four to five years. Then we also had some pretty big major milestones in Canada with CPF2 in the Surmont and Pad 267 in Surmont. CPF2 was successfully started up in September, and that's going to add about 100 millione cu ft a day of gas processing and about 30,000bbls of condensate, and water handling capacity.\nIn the Surmont, we averaged about 20,000bbls a day of production in Q3, and we're going to substantially grow that next year. Then finally, with Surmont Pad 267, we achieved first steam in September, and we'll get first oil in early 2024. Now, with 267 online, we'd expect to see Surmont grow something between 5,000 and 10,000bbls a day next year.\nImportantly, that's inclusive of a month-long turnaround that we conduct every five years in Surmont. I'm really proud of what we're doing and executing across these projects. I think the whole list of them here is a really good sort of example of how we leverage our existing infrastructure to deliver on our low-cost supply opportunities. Hopefully that gives you a feel for sort of the momentum we're building going into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks for the time. Bill, I was wondering if maybe you could help us on a little bit of broad strokes on 2024 CapEx thoughts. I think in the past you've talked about kind of flatish CapEx around $11 billion, admitting there's a lot of moving parts in an $80 environment. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about that as you're thinking forward.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, it's Dominic here, Stephen. What we'd say is very consistent with the AIM framework we laid out on CapEx. Just to recap the moving parts, we've got several moving pieces. Assuming Willow is sanctioned, which we expect, spending on that project will be higher. Then, of course, you have the incremental $100 million or so for the other 50% of Surmont that we're adding. Those increases will be mostly offset by, we're going to see lower spending on our LNG projects and roll-off of the project capital at Norway. I think the key message there is really very much in line with the framework we laid out at AIM. Of course, you do have the addition of Surmont, extra 50% there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Doug Leggett with Bank of America.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for having me on. Although Phil has gone to the dark side with the one question real fast.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nJust one man's opinion, Doug.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nIf I may, I'd like to make one comment and ask one question. My one comment is your stock's up almost 5% this morning. I think acknowledging your ordinary dividend move is gaining recognition in the market. Congratulations on taking that step. We'd like to see more of it. Okay, with that, my question is simply this. One of my peers asked a question earlier about performance in the Permian.\nI'd like to ask it a little differently. One of your very large peers had some non-operated portfolio problems in the quarter. You guys have got a large part of your production that comes from non-operated production. Is there any discernible difference between your operated performance and your non-operated performance that's driven this reliable production growth year-over-year?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, so I can't resist but to comment on your comment, Doug, and then I'll let Nick answer your question on the Lower 48. It's exactly what we thought should happen with top quartile targeted dividend growth as a company relative to the S&P 500. That's been our plan, and we're sticking to it and executing on that plan. Yeah, I can let Nick comment on your question about non-op and op in the Permian.\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Doug, good question. I mean, I think you're looking at the Q2 to Q3 performance this year. We were up 2%. Sequential growth, and as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're seeing 7% year-over-year. Obviously, that has a combination of our operated and non-operated portfolio. Both are performing well. Specifically, Doug, in Q2 to Q3, a large component of that increase was our operated Permian program, but as well as OBO.\nWe're seeing increases in the operated by others and a little bit of Bakken as well. I mean, these operated by others assets are very competitive. We look at every well. We benchmark each one, and it performs well within our cost of supply framework. As a reminder, if you look at Permian in general, about 30% of our production is coming from operated by others within the Permian.\nIf I take you back a little bit in time to the analyst investor day, when you think about the split between the two basins, we've got 2/3 of our inventory in the Delaware Basin, 1/3 in the Midland Basin to generate the full Lower 48 rate of 5%. Bottom line, Doug, is that they're both competing well. We would review every bucket to make sure we're investing the right capital and drive that capital efficiency.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nGood morning.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nRyan, you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but I'm hoping you can comment further on international gas integration strategy. I recognize it's early, but by our numbers, it seems like a lot of option value there. Maybe just thought process behind it and maybe any targets you might have to help us think about the future there.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I can let Bill give you some details there, Lloyd. Yeah, we're excited about the opportunity to add the regas capacity in the Netherlands at the Gate LNG. It complements well our German position. We're looking elsewhere as we try to build out and move the Port Arthur volumes and the volumes we have in other places around the globe into that market, which we think is going to be a strong market for many decades to come, which is why we're moving into this. Bill can be a bit more specific to your question on the details there.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'm happy to put a bit more color on that. We're very focused on developing market. As we've talked about, we like to do this in a stair-step fashion with how we originate supply. You've seen us announce Port Arthur LNG and Saguaro LNG. We're making really strong progress, 2.8 million tons per annum of regas capacity in Germany. Two of that is dedicated supporting our LNG SPAs out of Qatar. That leaves 0.8 at Germany. We've just added 1.5 million tons of regas capacity at Gate, so that's 2.3. That's roughly half of Port Arthur. I think importantly, we're continuing to see a lot of interest and strong demand for LNG.\nAs we've talked, we're looking to develop a diversified portfolio that's both sales into Europe and also sales into Asia, perhaps some FOB sales at the facility, and having a mix of variety of term links in that. I'm really pleased with the progress we're making within six months of kind of FID of Port Arthur. We've got roughly half of it placed. I think the way to think about that, just going back to the vignette I showed at aim, is you look at the capacity that we have into Germany and to TTF. The way to think about that, as you're modeling returns, is you start with the Henry Hub price, you add liquefaction tolls, shipping, and regas, and you compare that to what you think European gas price will be.\nThat's going to give you your base CFO for volumes into Europe before adding any diversion optionality onto that. You can do a similar type analysis going to Asia. Yeah, we share your view here that these are very interesting additions to our portfolio, and we're really pleased with the progress we're making.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nUtilities & Clean Energy Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. I want to echo the earlier comment on the dividend raise and ask a question on just shareholder returns. It's good to see the 14% increase. I was wondering if this large change in the dividend is more tied to incremental cash flow on Surmont or if there's been a broader change in how you're thinking about the target payout or dividend breakeven as you look out at the business over the next few years. Just as part of that, maybe you can give us an update on your broader thinking on shareholder return strategy and the breakdown of dividend, VROC, and buybacks in the context of today's increase.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I think nothing's changed in our framework, which we outlined, I think, pretty extensively at our last analyst meeting. Based on our mid-cycle price call, you can expect us to deliver at least 30% of our cash flow back to our shareholders. Then we've said when the prices are in excess of our mid-cycle price call, which is where the prices are today and where they've been over the last few years, you should expect us to be delivering more of our cash back.\nThat's, in fact, what we've done over the last five to six years. Delivered mid-40s, 45, 45% or so of our cash has gone back to our shareholders. It's done that in a form of both the cash and buying our shares back. Our construct around that really hasn't changed. We like to provide an affordable, reliable, ordinary dividend that grows competitive with the top quartile of the S&P 500 over time. We like to buy some of our shares back through the cycle in a mid-cycle construct.\nThen we introduce the third leg, VROC, to add additional return back to our shareholders when prices are above our mid-cycle price call. That's the construct we have. We're sticking to that. We think it's served the company pretty well. This year, we expect cash flow of close to $22 billion, and we're giving half of that back to our shareholders. That's probably not a bad starting point for next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.\n\nNitin Kumar\n\nSenior Energy Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just sticking with the theme of M&A, and I appreciate, Ryan, you touched on it in your comments. One of your peers out there has talked about improving recoveries in the Permian to the tune of 20% or higher than everybody else. You operate across the entire Permian Basin. I'm curious, are you deploying or seeing others deploy technologies that you think can improve recovery rates that significantly?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'll let Nick respond to that specifically. I guess I'd make this one broad comment. I think as we talk about this topic, I think in the companies, and a lot of people are guilty of this, conflation a bit between recovery and recovery rate or recovery factor. I think you have to be really careful when we talk about this in light of these unconventionals.\nWe're doing everything we can to improve the recovery that we get from the wells, the acreage, the blocks, and the layers that we have within our portfolio. Be careful not to conflate that to recovery factor or recovery rate. I can have Nick speak a bit more specifically about the things we're doing to make sure we get maximum recovery out of our assets.\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. Yeah, Nitin, our asset teams, as Ryan mentioned, are very focused on optimizing the recovery of our wells and our development projects across all the Lower 48 assets. I think it's important too is we seek to maximize recovery, but also driving improvement in capital. That's part of our returns-focused strategy and the cost of supply framework that we judge every decision against.\nWe look at kind of improving recovery across kind of three primary buckets. I'll take you through that, what we're looking at, what we're deploying within our assets. First, we look at development decisions. It is our first bucket. Secondly is how do we optimize the reservoir? That's our second bucket. Then the third one is really when we look at enhanced oil recovery, but that's more longer term.\nNow, Nitin, one of the things that we obviously have within the Permian, and we mentioned this at the Analyst Investor Day, is that we have two decades of inventory within the Permian at current big activities level. We have a lot of focus on development decisions and the reservoir optimization to improve recovery. A couple of things, well, lateral length is critical. We speak to about the inventory length.\nMore you can go from a one-lateral to a two- to a 3-mi lateral, you increase the recovery per well. As we've mentioned before, you go from a one- to a three-, we improve our cost of supply, which drives capital efficiency by 30% to 40%. We're doing that. As a reminder, we've got 80% of our Permian well inventory is 1.5-mi or greater, and 60% is two-mi or greater.\nWe're continuing to execute 3-mi laterals, year-to-year growth on those as well. On the well completion side, again, this still sits in that development decision bucket. We're doing some interesting work in the Bakken as an example using multivariate analysis where we optimize completion design to maximize both recovery and capital efficiency, and seeing recent completion results that are very favorable in that space. Then the kind of last item I'll address on the development decisions is around spacing and stacking.\nOne thing that we do out in the Midland Basin that you've heard here recently is co-development. Co-development allows us to minimize the parent-child impacts while improving recovery as well as capital efficiency. We've demonstrated over the last four years, both in the Midland Basin as well as the Delaware Basin around improved performance there.\nOn the second component that we're focusing in on reservoir optimization, I'll draw your attention to Eagle Ford. We're using kind of techniques where we refrac these wells, kind of late life in the wells. We're seeing improved well performance on expected ultimate recovery by 60%, which is very competitive in our cost-of-supply framework. Then I'll take you up to the Bakken. We're using infill wells and upcoming edge wells to further increase overall recovery.\nThese are also competitive in cost of supply. Again, that's increasing the recovery per pad. Then the final bucket, that enhanced oil recovery component, we've done many pilot studies, mainly in the Eagle Ford around gas injection, huff-n-puff. We've seen technical success. We've seen injectivity and the corresponding oil response. I'll leave you with this on the enhanced oil recovery.\nThese projects don't compete within our expansive drill-bit inventory at this point in time. We'll continue to study it and analyze it. That's something we can address in the future. From long laterals to improved completion design to infill wells, we're improving recovery in our assets.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning, everybody.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nMorning, Roger.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nA lot of this has been hit, but I guess I'll just ask about Alaska. There's been a little more noise up there on the, I don't know if you call it, regulatory legislative side. Then we're about to head into the winter season. I'm just curious, Willow and other things, what's going on there?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey, Roger, this is Andy. Yeah, let me take that one. I'll start with the legal, then we'll give you a bit of an update of where we are with the project. On the legal side, I've talked about this on previous calls. There are lawsuits challenging the federal government's approval of the project. As I mentioned on the last call, we expect to see a ruling on this in November. The preliminary rulings in April were favorable then the upcoming ruling will address the full scope of the legal challenge.\nAgain, I'm repeating myself a little here, but as I said on the last call, we're very happy with how the BLM and the cooperating agencies conducted the process and satisfied all the requirements to grant their approval. Wwe're confident and we're looking forward to those court rulings in November as we get ready for the 2024 season. Then I think the other part of the legal question you were alluding to is separately in September, the Department of the Interior proposed additional regulations for the management and protection of the NPR-A. Now, we don't expect these draft rules to impact Willow or prevent our exploration program.\nIt doesn't have any impact on the 10-year plan we previously laid out at aim. That said, we are concerned. If the rules are adopted as currently drafted, they could impact future developments beyond Willow in the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. We're going to be providing feedback to the Department of the Interior to try and make the proposed rules more consistent with the existing statute.\nAnd again, I'll just finish the legal bit with a reminder that the statute recognizes the primary purpose of the NPR-A is to increase domestic oil supply. That's kind of where we are on the legal side. Then just very quickly where we are in terms of the project. Taking a step back here, as I described back at our investor update, Willow is the kind of project that's right in our wheelhouse. We've got no first-of-a-kind type risk here.\nIt's three drill sites to one new processing facility. Our track record in Alaska was excellent at delivering on schedule and on budget. Specifically to where we are right now, work is progressing well. Our 2023 capital is fully factored into the total company guidance we gave today. We've started the first phase of module fabrication on the Gulf Coast.\nAnd then on the North Slope, we've successfully opened the gravel mine, and we're preparing for the 2024 construction season. We've already got over half of the project scope under firm contract. These contracts include clauses if we don't FID the project that we can exit. Now, of the contracts we've issued today, 75% of them are lump sum or unit rate. For these types of contracts, we have agreed a price and now have limited exposure to future inflation.\nAs we continue the contract negotiations, our estimate of capital to first production remains unchanged of $7 to 7.5 billion that we previously provided. I think that probably gives you a good update on where we are on the legal and on the project side of things.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nSorry, I think that's it, Ryan Todd. Maybe one for you, Ryan. You've been busy on the portfolio over the last few years across a wide range of regions and types of assets across the portfolio. Some of that is obviously opportunistic just when the timing of things like Surmont and APLNG came up. As you take a step back now and look, is there still more to do on the portfolio in terms of portfolio management?\nAre there increased high-grading opportunities on the divestiture side that we should expect as you've continued to develop things? Or any places that you would like to change or increase your exposure maybe as you look going forward down the line in terms of long-term competitiveness?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Ryan, I think as we tried to show you at the analyst meeting earlier this year, we're pretty pleased with all the efforts we've made in the company over the last four to five years to really, what we think has put out an extremely compelling 10-year plan. I wouldn't describe it. We really, really like where the portfolio has gotten to. It's got; it's global, it's diverse, it's got a great mix of short, medium, and longer cycle opportunities organically to invest in.\nAll those investments lead to $20 per barrel, less than $40 cost of supply. We've got a lot of visibility into what we think is a great plan. We're ruthless high graders of the portfolio. If something doesn't compete, we're looking for opportunities to move it out. I wouldn't describe we've got anything significant inside the portfolio today that would fall into that category. We're always looking and trying to be opportunistic, which I think describes, to your point, the APLNG JV and the Surmont JV that we hold.\nYou never quite know when your partners make a change that you didn't anticipate, and you get a great opportunity to acquire an asset that you know really well. The one that we know we can make better if we have it under our control. Ultimately, as I said, it makes our 10-year plan better. We're always out looking to find because you never quite know when these things might materialize, but we tend to be very opportunistic.\nI just remind people our framework is intact. It has to meet our financial framework. We got to see a way clear to make the asset better. Does it make that 10-year plan that we think is quite compelling? Does it make that 10-year plan better, which is a pretty high hurdle inside the company.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Paul Chang with Scotiabank.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHello, can you hear me?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYes, we sure can, Paul. Good morning.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHi, thank you. Good morning. One, if I can go back into permitting, what's your average lateral length now, and then how much do you think you can improve or lengthen it over the next several years? Is that one of the primary contributors that you think you could improve the result in your overall permitting operation? Also, whether you guys have tested it, because at some point, I would imagine it will reach these economies of scale when you get longer and longer. Do you have any experiment that you guys have done that what that limit may be? Is it four miles? Is it longer than four miles or less than four miles? Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Paul. I can let Nick kind of weigh in on some of that. Yeah, I think lateral length is just one of the things that we're working on. Nick described a bunch more in an earlier question around completion efficiency and how we're attacking the spacing and the stacking. I think it's all of those things that we're trying to attack. They're different depending on where you're at in the Bakken, the Eagle Ford, or the Permian.\nWe have deep experience in all three of those basins and using all of that knowledge to make sure we're maximizing the recovery and minimizing the cost of supply and maximizing the efficiency that we're getting out of it. Specifically on lateral length, I can let Nick weigh in on that.\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Paul, good morning. Just to reiterate again, we've got a significant, deep, and broad long lateral inventory across the assets. Just mentioned previously, the 80% of permitting inventory is 1.5mi or greater, and the 60% greater than two miles. We continue to see more and more 3-mi laterals. We're seeing good results coming out of the -mi laterals, both from our 2022 program as well as 2023.\nWe continue to see increases in that space. Our teams continue from a BD standpoint and a land standpoint to look at co-op opportunities. This is not only in the Permian, but as Ryan just mentioned in the Bakken, we just finished up some trades there to allow us to drill some 3-mi laterals in the future. We're increasing the portfolio of long laterals across all four assets.\nThe thing that you had talked about related to how far can you go. I'll just step back. The 3-mi laterals that we're seeing over the last couple of years are performing well. We're very encouraged with the results. You want to make sure you get contribution across that entire lateral length. As we would think about going further, longer lateral lengths, I think you mentioned four miles, there's a trade-off.\nYou can potentially drive down and improve cost of supply. Then also you have to look through the lens of operational risk. That operational risk is also not only in development drilling, actually drilling the well, but also future workovers. We're looking at that in the future. I'll leave you with the fact that the 3-mi laterals were performed extremely well. we've got a very deep inventory of long laterals, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Josh Silverstein with UBS.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Ryan, I appreciate the comments before on the return to capital thoughts for next year. I was curious with the added debt from the Marathon transaction, how you might think of additional shareholder returns versus this year or the want to build cash or pay down the debt there. Thanks.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I think we're in that planning process as we kind of think about next year and all those moving pieces. As such, I say it looks to me like at this juncture, the commodity prices are kind of very similar to where we were coming out at the end of last year, coming into the beginning of 2023. I think that framework around total return as a starting point is pretty good for 2024. We'll just have to see what commodity prices are as we go forward.\nWe have a plan, and Bill can address that to kind of pay off the debt as it comes due over the next few years. That gets us down to our original target of $15 billion gross debt. We can continue to do that. I think if we had a very large up cycle to the commodity price, we might look at adding more cash to the balance sheet as well. I think all three of those are in play as we think about what we do over the course of each quarter as we go into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask for an update maybe on the Venezuela process. It's come up in prior calls, and the process is advancing. I guess specifically, I want to ask about a scenario where the assets that aren't strategic to you get returned or surrendered to creditors. What might be the path forward from there? Because it's a large claim, and it's material. It seems like it'll be a good outcome for you, but might require some actions in the aftermath. Thank you.\n\nTim Leach\n\nAdvisor to the CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'm sure I understand, Sam. Yeah, we're in a process with the Venezuelans right now. They owe us a considerable amount of money through both our ICSID and our ICC claims, approaching over $8 billion. They owe us on the full judgment on the ICC. They still owe us $1.4 to $1.5 billion.\nWe're pursuing that pretty aggressively. I think we're watching the progress closely. Clearly, the US government has provided a lifting of some, if not all, of the sanctions here, waiting on results of what the Venezuelans do on the other end for free and fair elections. That may create a bit of an opening. This is a long process, but we're pretty committed to doing everything we can to make sure we get our money out of Venezuela that they owe us. That's what we're focused on.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Neal Dingman with Truist Securities.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nEnergy Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nIt's Neal. Is this for me?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Yeah. Go ahead.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nEnergy Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Thanks, guys. Ryan, my question, you hit on this a little bit. It's just on M&A specifically. Well, I appreciate your earlier comment about any assets needing to fit in the 10-year plan. I'm just wondering, is there a preference for when you're seeing things shorter, or longer-term cycle assets? Just also curious on how you view valuations of some of the recent public deals. Thanks.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, certainly, the way we look at it, Neal, is we like a global, we like a diverse portfolio. We like it to be balanced. I think we're mostly focused on what's the cost of supply to make sure it fits our framework around that. That any asset that you bring into the company, make sure it can compete for capital on an ongoing basis against a pretty rich, deep, durable, long life, and a lot of inventory sitting in the company today.\nAs I said, it's a pretty high bar. I don't know quite how to comment on the recent deals that have been done. Those are transactions. Those are really good companies that were bought. Clearly, they have good assets. We're pretty familiar with them. We've watched them for a long period of time. They're good companies with good assets. Transactions were in a part of the cycle that's a little frothy and probably at a higher mid-cycle price than we would ascribe to them, I guess. Maybe that's all I should probably say.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks. I was just kind of curious, does consolidation that creates larger peers in the Permian impact the competitiveness of comps development and positioning, specifically if you look at services and midstream capacity as you kind of move forward on your kind of 7% growth CAGR over the next decade plus?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nI don't think we see a huge issue there at all, Scott. There's a lot of operators already in the Permian Basin. It seems like the service side of the business has been accommodating all the activity that we have out there. There's been periods of tightness on certain categories of spend or certain services. By and large, we don't think it's going to be a big issue for us going forward.\nThe advantage of being one of those large operators in the basin is you get the attention of the service companies because they know you've got a program that's durable. They know you've got a program that has some length to it. They know you're not going to be whipsawing them around. Those are the kind of customers that they want to work for. Those are the, so they tend to work with us. We don't see any exposure to the current consolidation trend in the Permian. It's going to continue, no question. More probably needs to happen.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Kevin McCurdy with Pickering Energy Partners.\n\nKevin MacCurdy\n\nManaging Director, Pickering Energy Partners\n\nHey, good morning. I wonder if you can provide your current thoughts on adding activity in the Lower 48. I know you've said that you can grow production without adding. Others are looking at the current service prices, and commodity prices, and seeing this as a good time to add. Just want to hear your most recent thoughts on that. Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, I think that would be part of the process we're going through right now, Kevin. I think we're trying to think about what 2024 looks like. Our starting point is we're seeing the efficiencies, and we're seeing growth coming out of our assets. We started a place that says, \"Let's just think about flat scope.\" And then we'll think about these other drivers like commodity price or service capabilities, to your point, and make a decision as we go into next year about what the scope and the resulting capital will look like.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from a line of Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, ROTH MKM\n\nYeah, hi. Well, I wondered if you could just comment on what you're seeing in terms of kind of Lower 48 service cost trends. I think there was a lot of expectations a handful of months ago that costs may be falling, but now kind of commodities have kind of recovered. Maybe just give us kind of your perspective of kind of what you're seeing there on leading-edge costs.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nSVP of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Leo, it's Dominic. As we talked about the last quarter, we're certainly seeing some areas of deflation in the lower 48. I think if you look at our capital spend this quarter, that's part of that trend is in there in terms of being lower capital this quarter than the previous. We still expect our overall company capital inflation to average out in the mid-single digits this year over last year.\nThat's all reflected in our guidance. I would say that as we approach the end of the year, and this is something that is in our thought process right now, as kind of Ryan was alluding to, we do think the market's kind of finally balanced. We do see some deflation coming through, but we have seen oil and gas prices recently strengthen.\nWhat we're looking very hard is at how we think that will trend into next year. I think, as I said earlier, in terms of our overall capital expectations next year, very much in line with what we laid out at AIM, of course, plus our additional interest in Surmont. That's just something that we're watching closely. That gives you a good sense of how we're thinking, so.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions at this time. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Welcome to the Q3 2023 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Liz, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in the listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During the question-and-answer session, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thank you. Welcome to everyone to our Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO, Tim Leach, Advisor to the CEO, Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dominic Macklon, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48, Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Global Operations, Kirk Johnson, Senior Vice President, Lower 48 Assets and Operations, and Will Giraud, Senior Vice President, Corporate Planning and Development.\nRyan and Bill will kick it off with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the Investor Relations website.\nSecond, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. We'll make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. Before I turn it over, I just want to flag for today we'll do one question per caller. With that, let me turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips",
    "content2": "Thank you, Phil. Thank you to everyone for joining our Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call. It was another solid quarter for ConocoPhillips as the team continued to deliver strong underlying performance across the portfolio. We have achieved several additional project milestones in our international portfolio in early October. Now, before I get into the details, I wanted to address the topical news in the industry, which has been the M&A headlines in recent weeks.\nThis is not a surprise to us. We have long said that we expect to see further industry consolidation. ConocoPhillips remains steadfast in our returns-focused value proposition and cost-to-supply principles, which creates a high bar for M&A. As a reminder, we've been actively high-grading our own portfolio over the past several years.\nAs a recent example, we are pleased to have closed on the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Surmont in early October. An opportunity came along to acquire this asset at a very attractive price that fit our financial framework, an asset we can make better through our full ownership, and an acquisition that makes our 10-year plan even better. Surmont is a long-life, low-declining, and low-capital-intensity asset that we know well.\nWe achieved first steam from Pad 267 in Q3, and production is expected to start up in Q1 2024. This is our first new pad addition since 2016. As we said at a recent analyst meeting, we can leverage existing infrastructure to add additional pads with very limited capital requirements in the years ahead.\nNow, moving to global LNG, we've also continued to progress our strategy, securing 1.5 MTPA of regas capacity at the Gate LNG terminal in the Netherlands. This will take our total European regas capacity to 4.3 MTPA. We have now effectively secured destinations for nearly half of our Port Arthur LNG offtake commitment in the first six months since we sanctioned the project.\nNow, elsewhere in the international portfolio, we started up our second central processing facility, CPF2, in the Surmont. In Norway, we just announced that we have started up three project developments ahead of schedule in October. This includes the company-operated Tommeliten A subsea tieback project at Ekofisk, which is nearly six months earlier than originally planned, as well as two non-operated projects. Finally, in China, our partner started up Bohai Phase IVB ahead of schedule in October.\nAs you can see, our diversified international portfolio continues to be a strong differentiator for our company. Shifting to results, we had record global and Lower 48 production in Q3. We raised our full-year production guidance to account for the closing of the Marathon acquisition, all this while achieving continued capital efficiency improvements as our full-year capital guidance remains unchanged.\nWe also continued to deliver on our returns to our shareholders. We increased our quarterly ordinary dividend by 14%, consistent with our long-term objective to deliver top quartile increases relative to the S&P 500. We have distributed $8.5 billion in dividends and buybacks year-to-date, and we remain on track for our $11 billion full-year target. We did this while funding the shorter and longer-term organic capital growth opportunities that we see across the entire portfolio. The team continues to execute well.\nOur deep, durable, and diversified asset base continues to get better and better. We are well-positioned to generate competitive returns and cash flow for decades to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our Q3 performance in more detail.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. In the Q3, we generated $2.16 per share in adjusted earnings. We produced 1,806,000bbls of oil equivalent per day, representing 3% underlying growth year-over-year. Planned turnarounds were successfully completed in Norway and Alaska. Lower 48 production averaged 1,083,000bbls of oil equivalent per day, including 722,000 from the Permian, 232,000 from the Eagle Ford, and 111,000 from the Bakken.\nLower 48 underlying production grew 8% year-on-year with new wells online and strong well performance relative to our expectations. Moving to cash flows, Q3 CFO was $5.5 billion, including APLNG distributions of $442 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $2.5 billion, which included $360 million for longer cycle projects. Through the end of the Q3, we have now funded $875 million for Port Arthur LNG out of our planned $1.1 billion for the year.\nRegarding returns of capital, we delivered $2.6 billion to shareholders in the Q3. This was via $1.3 billion in share buybacks and $1.3 billion in ordinary dividends, and VROC payments. Today, as Ryan said, we announced an increase to our ordinary dividend of 14% to $0.58 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $9.7 billion, which included proceeds from the $2.7 billion in long-term debt that we issued to fund the Surmont acquisition, which closed in early October.\nBefore shifting to guidance, I do want to take a quick moment to update about our VROC. Beginning in 2024, we will be aligning both the announcement timing and subsequent payment of our VROC with our ordinary dividend. Therefore, you can expect us to provide details on our Q1 VROC payment on the Q4 call in February.\nNow, turning to guidance, which now reflects additional 50% of Surmont in early October, we forecast Q4 production to be in a range of 1.86 to 1.9 million bbls of oil equivalent per day. Full-year production guidance is now roughly 1.82 million bbls of oil equivalent per day. Now, to put this production guidance in the context, we expect underlying growth for both the Q4 and the full year to be roughly 4% year-over-year, which includes Lower 48 production growth of roughly 7%. This is very consistent with our full-year guidance and our long-term plan we laid out at our analyst and investor meeting. For APLNG, we expect distributions of $300 million in the Q4 and $1.9 billion for the full year.\nWhile APLNG distributions can vary quarter-to-quarter, a normalized run rate to think about moving forward is around $400 million per quarter at current price levels. Shifting to adjusted operating costs, we raised our full-year guidance by $300 million to $8.6 billion. This was driven by our increased working interest in Surmont, increased Lower 48 non-operating activity, and inflationary impacts in the Lower 48.\nWe've also raised our DD&A guidance by $100 million to $8.3 billion, which is also primarily due to Surmont. Full-year adjusted corporate net loss guidance remains unchanged at roughly $800 million. The second-half run rate is a good starting point for 2024. Finally, our full-year capital spending guidance range is also unchanged. To wrap up, we had another solid operational quarter.\nWe continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives across our diverse portfolio, and we remain highly competitive on our shareholder distributions. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it back over to the operators to start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one again. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question comes from a line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much. There's been a lot of variability in Lower 48 results from some of your competitors. You guys have been very steady tracking at this 7% growth rate. Just love your perspective walking through the basins, particularly the Permian. What is working, what's not for you guys, and how do you feel about the plan as you move into 2024?\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Neil, this is Nick. You're right. I mean, overall, if you look at our performance across all our basins, it's been strong and in line with prior year performance across, again, all those Lower 48 assets. I'd also mention that it's been in line with our tight curve expectations. I'll call out, for example, Delaware well performance is showing top quartile on volumes produced not only on a barrel of oil per basis, but also on a BOE per basis per foot. We're seeing very encouraging results there. I think the key point too is this strong performance reinforces our strong focus on a returns capital efficient environment that we've set there.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nI would add, Neil, it speaks again to the quality and the depth of the inventory in the company. We're prosecuting some of the best acreage in the basin and doing it in such a way that's focused on capital efficiency and returns, as Nick described. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of John Royall with JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You've had a handful of international project startups that you touched on in the release. If you could give us some more color on these projects, that would be helpful. Maybe if you could tie that into a growth outlook for the international business in 2024 as well, that would be helpful.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, John. This is Andy. I can take that one. It's a little early to be getting into full-year guidance for 2024. As you mentioned, we have had some pretty good news across our Alaskan international projects. We've made some pretty significant progress across the portfolio. It really is nice to see so many of those projects achieve major milestones on or ahead of schedule and budget. Ryan touched on Norway.\nIhere we achieved first production ahead of schedule on three of our four subsea tiebacks. We expect the fourth one to come online as planned in Q2 2024. We expect those four projects in aggregate to add about 20,000bbls a day of production next year, which should more than offset normal decline in 2024.\nWe also had some good news in China where our partner-operated Bohai Phase IVb achieved first production ahead of schedule on the first platform. Now, that's going to be two platforms tied back to a central processing facility. We'd expect the second platform to come on in the Q1. Then with that, we'll then have the opportunity to drill new wells in Bohai for the next four to five years. We also had some pretty big major milestones in Canada with CPF2 in the Surmont and Pad 267 in Surmont. CPF2 was successfully started up in September.\nThat's going to add about 100 million cu ft a day of gas processing and about 30,000bbls of condensate and water handling capacity. In the Surmont, we averaged about 20,000bbls a day of production in Q3. We're going to substantially grow that next year. Then finally, with Surmont Pad 267, we achieved first steam in September, and we'll get first oil in early 2024. Now, with 267 online, we'd expect to see Surmont grow something between 5 and 10,000bbls a day next year.\nImportantly, that's inclusive of a month-long turnaround that we conduct every five years in Surmont. I'm really proud of what we're doing and executing across these projects. I think the whole list of them here is a really good sort of example of how we leverage our existing infrastructure to deliver on our low-cost supply opportunities. Hopefully that gives you a feel for sort of the momentum we're building going into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks for the time. Bill, I was wondering if maybe you could help us on a little bit of broad strokes on 2024 CapEx thoughts. I think in the past you've talked about kind of flatish CapEx around $11 billion, admitting there's a lot of moving parts in an $80 environment. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about that as you're thinking forward.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, it's Dominic here, Steven. What we'd say is very consistent with the AIM framework we laid out on CapEx. Just to recap the moving parts, we've got several moving pieces. Assuming Willow is sanctioned, which we expect, spending on that project will be higher. Then, of course, you have the incremental $100 million or so for the other 50% of Surmont that we're adding. Those increases will be mostly offset by we're going to see lower spending on our LNG projects and roll-off of the project capital at Norway. I think the key message there is really very much in line with the framework we laid out at AIM. Of course, you do have the addition of Surmont, extra 50% there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Doug Leggett with Bank of America.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for having me on. Although Phil has gone to the dark side with the one question rule by the analysts.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nJust one man's opinion, Doug.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nIf I may, I'd like to make one comment and ask one question. My one comment is your stock's up almost 5% this morning. I think acknowledging your ordinary dividend move is gaining recognition in the market. Congratulations on taking that step. We'd like to see more of it. Okay, with that, my question is simply this. One of my peers asked a question earlier about performance in the Permian.\nI'd like to ask it a little differently. One of your very large peers had some non-operated portfolio problems in the quarter. You guys have got a large part of your production that comes from non-operated production. Is there any discernible difference between your operated performance and your non-operated performance that's driven this reliable production growth year-over-year?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, so I can't resist but to comment on your comment, Doug, and then I'll let Nick answer your question on the Lower 48. It's exactly what we thought should happen with top quartile targeted dividend growth as a company relative to the S&P 500. That's been our plan, and we're sticking to it and executing on that plan. Yeah, I can let Nick comment on your question about not opting out in the Permian.\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Doug, good question. I mean, I think you're looking at the Q2 to Q3 performance this year. We were up 2%. Sequential growth, and as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're seeing 7% year-over-year. Obviously, that has a combination of our operated and non-operated portfolio. Both are performing well. Specifically, Doug, in Q2 to Q3, a large component of that increase was our operated Permian program, but as well as OBO.\nSo we're seeing increases in the operated by others and a little bit of Bakken as well. I mean, these operated by others assets are very competitive. We look at every barrel. We benchmark each one, and it performs well within our cost-of-supply framework. As a reminder, if you look at Permian in general, about 30% of our production is coming from operated by others within the Permian.\nIf I take you back a little bit in time to the analyst investor day, when you think about the split between the two basins, we've got 2/3 of our inventory in the Delaware, 1/3 in the Midland Basin to generate the full Lower 48 rate of 5%. Bottom line, Doug, is that they're both competing well. We review every barrel to make sure we're investing the right capital and drive that capital efficiency.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Ryan, you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but I'm hoping you can comment further on international gas integration strategy. I recognize it's early, but by our numbers, it seems like a lot of option value there. Maybe just thought process behind it and maybe any targets you might have to help us think about the future there.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I can let Bill give you some details there, Lloyd. Yeah, we're excited about the opportunity to add the regas capacity in the Netherlands at the Gate LNG. It complements well our German position. We're looking elsewhere as we try to build out and move the Port Arthur volumes and the volumes we have in other places around the globe into that market, which we think is going to be a strong market for many decades to come, which is why we're moving into this. Bill can be a bit more specific to your question on the details there.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'm happy to put a bit more color on that. We're very focused on developing market. As we've talked about, we like to do this in a stair-step fashion with how we originate supply. You've seen us announce Port Arthur LNG and Saguaro LNG. We're making really strong progress. 2.8 million tonnes per annum of regas capacity at Germany. Two of that is dedicated supporting our LNG SPAs out of Qatar. That leaves 0.8 at Germany. We just added 1.5 million tonnes of regas capacity at Gate, so that's 2.3. That's roughly half of Port Arthur. I think importantly, we're continuing to see a lot of interest and strong demand for LNG.\nAs we've talked, we're looking to develop a diversified portfolio that's both sales into Europe and also sales into Asia, perhaps some FOB sales at the facility, and having a mix of variety of term links in that. I'm really pleased with the progress we're making within six months of kind of FID of Port Arthur. We've got roughly half of it placed. I think the way to think about that, just going back to the vignette I showed at aim, is you look at the capacity that we have into Germany, into TTF. The way to think about that as you're modeling returns is you start with the Henry Hub price, you add liquefaction tolls, shipping, and regas, and you compare that to what you think European gas price will be.\nThat's going to give you your base CFO for volumes into Europe before adding any diversion optionality onto that. You can do a similar type analysis going to Asia. Yeah, we share your view here that these are very interesting additions to our portfolio, and we're really pleased with the progress we're making.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nUtilities & Clean Energy Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. I want to echo the earlier comment on the dividend raise and ask a question on just shareholder returns. It's good to see the 14% increase. I was wondering if this large change in the dividend is more tied to incremental cash flow on Surmont or if there's been a broader change in how you're thinking about the target payout or dividend breakeven as you look out at the business over the next few years. Just as part of that, maybe you can give us an update on your broader thinking on shareholder return strategy and the breakdown of dividend, VROC, and buybacks in the context of today's increase.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I think nothing's changed in our framework, which we outlined, I think, pretty extensively at our last analyst meeting. Based on our mid-cycle price call, you can expect us to deliver at least 30% of our cash flow back to our shareholders.\nThen we've said when the prices are in excess of our mid-cycle price call, which is where the prices are today and where they've been over the last few years, you should expect us to be delivering more of our cash back. That's, in fact, what we've done over the last five to six years. Delivered mid-40s, 45, 45% or so of our cash has gone back to our shareholders. It's done that in the form of both the cash and buying our shares back. Our construct around that really hasn't changed.\nWe like to provide an affordable, reliable, ordinary dividend that grows competitive with the top quartile, the S&P 500 over time. We like to buy some of our shares back through the cycle in a mid-cycle construct. Then we introduced the third leg, VROC, to add additional return back to our shareholders when prices are above our mid-cycle price call. That's the construct we have. We're sticking to that. We think it's served the company pretty well. Like this year, we expect cash flow of close to $22 billion, and we're giving half of that back to our shareholders. That's probably not a bad starting point for next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.\n\nNitin Kumar\n\nSenior Energy Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just sticking with the theme of M&A, and I appreciate, Ryan, you touched on it in your comments. One of your peers out there has talked about improving recoveries in the Permian to the tune of 20% or higher than everybody else. You operate across the entire Permian Basin. I'm curious, are you deploying or seeing others deploy technologies that you think can improve recovery rates that significantly?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'll let Nick respond to that specifically. I guess I'd make this one broad comment, is, I think as we talk about this topic, I think in the companies, and a lot of people are guilty of this, conflation a bit between recovery and recovery rate or recovery factor. I think you have to be really careful when we talk about this in light of these unconventionals.\nWe're doing everything we can to improve the recovery that we get from the wells, the acreage, the blocks, the layers that we have within our portfolio. Be careful not to conflate that to recovery factor or recovery rate. I can have Nick speak a bit more specifically about the things we're doing to make sure we get maximum recovery out of our assets.\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. Yeah, Nitin, our asset teams, as Ryan mentioned, are very focused on optimizing the recovery of our wells and our development projects across all the Lower 48 assets. I think it's important too, as we seek to maximize recovery, but also driving improvement in capital. That's part of our returns-focused strategy and the cost of supply framework that we judge every decision against.\nWe look at kind of improving recovery across kind of three primary buckets. I'll take you through that, what we're looking at, what we're deploying within our assets. First, we look at development decisions. It is our first bucket. Secondly is, how do we optimize the reservoir? That's our second bucket. Then the third one is really when we look at enhanced oil recovery, but that's more long term.\nNow, Nitin, one of the things that we obviously have within the Permian, and we mentioned this at the Analyst Investor Day, is that we have two decades of inventory within the Permian at current rig activities level. We have a lot of focus on development decisions and the reservoir optimization to improve recovery. A couple of things; well, lateral length is critical.\nWe speak to about the inventory length; more you can go from a one lateral to a 2 to a 3-mi lateral, you increase the recovery per well. As we've mentioned before, you go from a one to a three; we improve our cost of supply, which drives capital efficiency by 30% to 40%. We're doing that. As a reminder, we've got 80% of our Permian well inventory is 1.5 miles or greater, and 60% is two miles or greater.\nWe're continuing to execute 3-mi laterals year-to-year growth on those as well. On the well completion side, again, this still sits in that development decision bucket. We're doing some interesting work in the Bakken as an example, using multivariate analysis where we optimize completion design to maximize both recovery and capital efficiency, and seeing recent completion results that are very favorable in that space.\nThen the kind of last item I'll address on the development decisions is around spacing and stacking. One thing that we do out in the Midland Basin that you've heard here recently is co-development. Co-development allows us to minimize the parent-child impacts while improving recovery as well as capital efficiency. We've demonstrated over the last four years, both in the Midland Basin as well as the Delaware Basin, around improved performance there.\nOn the second component that we're focusing in on reservoir optimization, I'll draw your attention to Eagle Ford. We're using kind of techniques where we refract these wells, kind of late life in the wells. We're seeing improved well performance on expected ultimate recovery by 60%, which is very competitive in our cost of supply framework. Then I'll take you up to the Bakken. We're using infill wells and upcoming edge wells to further increase overall recovery.\nThese are also competitive in cost of supply. Again, that's increasing the recovery per pad. Then the final bucket, that enhanced oil recovery component, we've done many pilot studies, mainly in the Eagle Ford around gas injection huff-n-puff. We've seen technical success. We've seen injectivity and the corresponding oil response. I'll leave you with this on the enhanced oil recovery.\nThese projects don't compete within our expansive drilling inventory at this point in time. We'll continue to study it and analyze it. That's something we can address in the future. From long laterals to improved completion design to infill wells, we're improving recovery in our assets.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning, everybody.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nMorning, Roger.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nA lot of this has been hit, but I guess I'll just ask about Alaska. There's been a little more noise up there on the, I don't know if you call it regulatory legislative side. Then we're about to head into the winter season. I'm just curious, Willow and other things, what's going on there?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey, Roger, this is Andy. Yeah, let me take that one. I'll start with the legal, then we'll give you a bit of an update of where we are with the project. On the legal side, I've talked about this on previous calls. There are lawsuits challenging the federal government's approval of the project. As I mentioned on the last call, we expect to see a ruling on this in November.\nThe preliminary rulings in April were favorable. Then the upcoming ruling will address the full scope of the legal challenge. Again, I'm repeating myself a little here, but as I said on the last call, we're very happy with how the BLM and the cooperating agencies conducted the process and satisfied all the requirements to grant their approval.\nWe're confident and we're looking forward to those court rulings in November as we get ready for the 2024 season. Then I think the other part of the legal question you were alluding to is separately in September, the Department of the Interior proposed additional regulations for the management and protection of the NPR-A. We don't expect these draft rules to impact Willow or prevent our exploration program.\nIt doesn't have any impact on the 10-year plan we previously laid out at aim. That said, we are concerned if the rules are adopted as currently drafted, they could impact future developments beyond Willow in the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. We'll be providing feedback to the Department of the Interior to try and make the proposed rules more consistent with the existing statute.\nAgain, I'll just finish the legal bit with a reminder of the statute recognizes the primary purpose of the NPR-A is to increase domestic oil supply. That's kind of where we are on the legal side. Then just very quickly where we are in terms of the project. Taking a step back here, as I described back at our investor update, Willow is the kind of project that's right in our wheelhouse.\nWe've got no first-of-a-kind type risk here. It's three drill sites to one new processing facility. Our track record in Alaska was excellent at delivering on schedule and on budget. Specifically to where we are right now, work is progressing well. Our 2023 capital is fully factored into the total company guidance we gave today. We've started the first phase of module fabrication on the Gulf Coast.\nThen on the North Slope, we've successfully opened the gravel mine. We're preparing for the 24th construction season. We've already got over half of the project scope under firm contracts. These contracts include clauses if we don't FID the project that we can exit. Of the contracts we've issued today, 75% of them are lump sum or unit rate. These types of contracts, we have agreed a price and now have limited exposure to future inflation.\nAs we continue the contract negotiations, our estimate of capital to first production remains unchanged of $7 to 7.5 billion that we previously provided. I think that probably gives you a good update on where we are on the legal and on the project side of things.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nSorry, I think that's it, Ryan Todd. Maybe one for you, Ryan. You've been busy on the portfolio over the last few years across a wide range of regions and types of assets across the portfolio. Some of that is obviously opportunistic just when the timing of things like Surmont and APLNG came up. As you take a step back now and look, is there still more to do on the portfolio in terms of portfolio management?\nAre there increased high-grade opportunities on the divestiture side that we should expect as you've continued to develop things? Or any places that you would like to change or increase your exposure maybe as you look going forward down the line in terms of long-term competitiveness?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Ryan, I think as we tried to show you at the analyst meeting earlier this year, we're pretty pleased with all the efforts we've made over the last four to five years to really, what we think has put out an extremely compelling 10-year plan. I wouldn't describe the; we really, really like where the portfolio has gotten to. It's got a, it's global, it's diverse, it's got a great mix of short, medium, and longer cycle opportunities organically to invest in.\nAll those investments lead to 20 billion bbls at less than $40 cost of supply. We've got a lot of visibility into what we think is a great plan. We're ruthless high graders of the portfolio. If something doesn't compete, we're looking for opportunities to move it out. I wouldn't describe we've got anything significant inside the portfolio today that would fall into that category.\nWe're always looking and trying to be opportunistic, which I think describes, to your point, the APLNG Rover and the Surmont Rover that we hold. You never quite know when your partners make a change that you didn't anticipate and you get a great opportunity to acquire an asset that you know really well. The one that we know we can make better if we have it under our control.\nUltimately, as I said, it makes our 10-year plan better. We're always out looking to find because you never quite know when these things might materialize, but we tend to be very opportunistic. I just remind people our framework is intact. It has to meet our financial framework. We got to see a way clear to make the asset better. Does it make that 10-year plan that we think is quite compelling? Does it make that 10-year plan better, which is a pretty high hurdle inside the company?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Paul Chang with Scotiabank.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHello, can you hear me?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYes, we sure can, Paul. Good morning.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHi, thank you. Good morning. Ryan, if I can go back into permitting. What's your average net lateral length now, and then how much do you think you can improve or lengthen it over the next several years? Is that one of the primary contributors that you think you could improve the result in your overall permitting operation? And also, whether you guys have tested because at some point I would imagine it will reach this economy of scale when you get longer and longer. Do you have any experiment that you guys have done that what that limit may be? Is it four miles? Is it longer than 4 mi or less than 4 mi? Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Paul. I can let Nick kind of weigh in on some of that. Yeah, I think lateral length is just one of the things that we're working on. Nick described a bunch more in an earlier question around completion efficiency and how we're attacking the spacing and the stacking. I think it's all of those things that we're trying to attack. They're different depending on where you're at in the Bakken, the Eagle Ford, or the Permian.\nWe have deep experience in all three of those basins and using all of that knowledge to make sure we're maximizing the recovery and minimizing the cost of supply and maximizing the efficiency that we're getting out of it. Specifically on lateral lengths, I can let Nick weigh in on that.\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Paul, good morning. Just to reiterate again, we've got a significant, deep, and broad long lateral inventory across the assets. Just mentioned previously, the 80% of Permian inventory is 1.5 mi or greater, and the 60% greater than 2 mi. We continue to see more and more 3-mi laterals. We're seeing good results coming out of the 3-mi laterals, both from our 2022 program, as well as 2023.\nWe continue to see increases in that space. Our teams continue from a BD standpoint and a land standpoint, look at core-up opportunities. This is not only in the Permian, but as Ryan just mentioned, in the Bakken. We just finished up some trades there to allow us to drill some 3-mi laterals in the future. We're increasing the portfolio of long laterals across all four assets.\nThe thing that you had talked about related to how far can you go. I'll just step back. The 3-mi laterals that we're seeing over the last couple of years are performing well. We're very encouraged with the results. You want to make sure you get contribution across that entire lateral length. As we would think about going further, longer lateral lengths, I think you mentioned four miles, there's a trade-off.\nYou can potentially drive down and improve cost of supply. Then also you have to look through the lens of operational risk. That operational risk is also not only in development drilling, actually drilling the well, but also future workers. We're looking at that in the future. I'll leave you with the fact that the 3-mi laterals were performed extremely well. We've got a very deep inventory of long laterals, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Josh Silverstein with UBS.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Ryan, I appreciate the comments before on the return of capital thoughts for next year. I was curious, with the added debt from the Marathon transaction, how you might think of additional shareholder returns versus this year or do you want to build cash or pay down the debt there. Thanks.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I think we're in that planning process as we kind of think about next year and all those moving pieces. As such, I say it looks to me like at this juncture, the commodity prices are kind of very similar to where we were coming out of the end of last year coming into the beginning of 2023. I think that framework around total return as a starting point is pretty good for 2024. We'll just have to see what commodity prices are as we go forward. We have a plan, and Bill can address that to kind of pay off the debt as it comes due over the next few years. That gets us down to our original target of 15 billion gross debt. We can continue to do that.\nI think if we had a very large up cycle to the commodity price, we might look at adding more cash to the balance sheet as well. I think all three of those are in play as we think about what we do over the course of each quarter as we go into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask for an update maybe on the Venezuela process. It's come up in prior calls, and the process is advancing. I guess specifically, I want to ask about a scenario where the assets that aren't strategic to you get returned or surrendered to creditors, and what might be the path forward from there because it's a large claim and it's material. It seems like it'll be a good outcome for you, but it might require some actions in the aftermath. Thank you.\n\nTim Leach\n\nAdvisor to the CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'm sure I understand, Sam. Yeah, we're in a process with the Venezuelans right now. They owe us a considerable amount of money through both our ICSID and our ICC claims, approaching over $8 billion. They owe us on the full judgment on the ICC. They still owe us $1.4 to $1.5 billion. We're pursuing that pretty aggressively. I think we're watching the progress closely.\nClearly, the US government has provided a lifting of some, if not all, of the sanctions here, waiting on results of what the Venezuelans do on the other end for free and fair elections. That may create a bit of an opening. This is a long process, but we're pretty committed to doing everything we can to make sure we get our money out of Venezuela that they owe us. That's what we're focused on.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Neal Dingman with Truist Securities.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nEnergy Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nIt's Neil. Is this for me?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Yep. Go ahead.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nEnergy Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Thanks, guys. Ryan, my question. You hit on this a little bit. It's just on M&A specifically. Well, I appreciate your earlier comment about any assets needing to fit in the 10-year plan. I'm just wondering, is there a preference for when you're seeing things, shorter or longer-term cycle assets, and just also curious on how you view valuations of some of the recent public deals? Thanks.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, certainly, the way we look at it, Neal, is we like a global, we like a diverse portfolio. We like it to be balanced. I think we're mostly focused on what's the cost of supply to make sure it fits our framework around that and that any asset that you bring into the company, make sure it can compete for capital on an ongoing basis against a pretty rich, deep, durable, long life, a lot of inventory sitting in the company today.\nas I said, it's a pretty high bar. I don't know quite how to comment on the recent deals that have been done. Those are transactions. Those are really good companies that were bought. Clearly, they have good assets. We're pretty familiar with them. We've watched them for a long period of time. They're good companies with good assets. Transactions were in a part of the cycle that's a little frothy and probably at a higher mid-cycle price than we would ascribe to them, I guess. Maybe that's all I should probably say.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks. I was just kind of curious, does consolidation that creates larger peers in the Permian impact the competitiveness of COP's development and positioning, specifically if you look at services and midstream capacity as you kind of move forward on your kind of 7% growth kick over the next decade plus?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nI don't think we see a huge issue there at all, Scott. There's a lot of operators already in the Permian Basin. It seems like the service side of the business has been accommodating all the activity that we have out there. There's been periods of tightness on certain categories of spend or certain services, but by and large, we don't think it's going to be a big issue for us going forward.\nThe advantage of being one of those large operators in the basin is you get the attention of the service companies because they know you've got a program that's durable. They know you've got a program that has some length to it. They know you're not going to be whipsawing them around. Those are the kind of customers that they want to work for. Those are the, so they tend to work with us. We don't see any exposure to the current consolidation trend in the Permian. It's going to continue, no question. More probably needs to happen.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Kevin McCurdy with Pickering Energy Partners.\n\nKevin MacCurdy\n\nManaging Director, Pickering Energy Partners\n\nHey, good morning. I wonder if you can provide your current thoughts on adding activity in the Lower 48. I know you've said that you can grow production without adding, but others are looking at the current service prices and commodity prices and seeing this as a good time to add. Just want to hear your most recent thoughts on that. Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, I think that would be part of the process we're going through right now, Kevin. I think we're trying to think about what 2024 looks like, but our starting point is we're seeing the efficiencies and we're seeing growth coming out of our assets. We started a place that says, \"Let's just think about flat scope,\" and then we'll think about these other drivers like commodity price or service capabilities to your point and make a decision as we go into next year about what the scope and the resulting capital will look like.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from a line of Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, ROTH MKM\n\nYeah, hi. Well, I wondered if you could just comment on what you're seeing in terms of kind of Lower 48 service cost trends. I think there was a lot of expectations a handful of months ago that costs may be falling, but now kind of commodities have kind of recovered. Maybe just give us kind of your perspective of kind of what you're seeing there on leading-edge costs.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nSVP of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Leo, it's Dominic. As we talked about the last quarter, we're certainly seeing some areas of deflation in the Lower 48. I think if you look at our capital spend this quarter, part of that trend is in there in terms of being lower capital this quarter than the previous. We still expect our overall company capital inflation to average out in the mid-single digits this year over last year.\nthat's all reflected in our guidance. I would say that as we approach the end of the year, and this is something that is in our thought process right now, as kind of Ryan was alluding to, we do think the market's kind of finally balanced. We do see some deflation coming through, but we have seen oil and gas prices recently strengthen.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWhat we're looking very hard is at how we think that will trend into next year. I think, as I said earlier, in terms of our overall capital expectations next year, very much in line with what we laid out at aim, of course, plus our additional interest in Surmont. That's just something that we're watching closely, but that gives you a good sense of how we're thinking, so.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions at this time. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

My name is Liz, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During the question-and-answer session, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone telephone. I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Liz, and welcome to everyone to our Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Tim Leach, Advisor to the CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklin, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Global Operations; Kirk Johnson, Senior Vice President, Lower 48 Assets and Operations; and Will Giraud, Senior Vice President, Corporate Planning and Development. Ryan and Bill will kick off the call with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we publish supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the Investor Relations website.\nSecond, during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. We will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Phil, and thank you to everyone joining our Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. It was certainly another busy quarter for ConocoPhillips. In April, we hosted our analyst and investor meeting in New York City, where we laid out our 10-year strategic and financial plan. We committed to you that we would keep working to make the plan even better. We've done that again this quarter. We executed an agreement to purchase the remaining 50% of Surmont, which we expect to close in the Q4. Surmont is a long-life, low-decline, and low-capital-intensity asset that we know very well. In the current $80 per barrel WTI price environment, we expect incremental free cash flow from the additional 50% interest to approach $1 billion in 2024. We expect first production in early 2024 from Pad 267, our first new pad since 2016.\nWe see debottlenecking potential at the facility to further improve our cash flows. We also continue to progress our global LNG strategy. In the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of our interest in the Qatar North Field South joint venture. In North America, we executed agreements for 2.2 million tons per annum of offtake at the Saguaro LNG project on the West Coast of Mexico. In Germany, we can confirm we have secured a total of 2.8 million tons per annum of regasification capacity at German LNG. While it's only been a few months since FID at Port Arthur LNG, we are further progressing our offtake placement opportunities in both Europe and Asia. Now shifting to the quarter, while commodity prices were volatile, ConocoPhillips continued to deliver strong underlying performance.\nOnce again, we had record global and Lower 48 production, and we raised our full-year production guidance for the second straight quarter. This was achieved through continued capital efficiency improvements as the midpoint of our full-year capital guidance remains unchanged. We continue to deliver on our returns-focused value proposition. We have distributed $5.8 billion through dividends and buybacks year to date, putting us well on track to achieve our planned $11 billion return of capital for 2023. We did this while funding the shorter and longer-term organic growth opportunities that we see across the entire portfolio. So in conclusion, our deep and our durable and diversified asset base continues to get better and better. We are well positioned to generate competitive returns and cash flow for decades to come. Now let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our Q2 performance in more detail.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. Diving into Q2 performance, we generated $1.84 per share in adjusted earnings. We recognize that this result was below consensus, which we primarily attribute to transitory price capture headwinds in Lower 48 natural gas and Alaska crude. Now, based on strip pricing for the second half, we expect price capture to normalize and be consistent with our previous full-year guidance of $22 billion in CFO at $80 WTI and our published full-year sensitivities. Moving to production, we set another record in Q2, producing 1,805,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing 6% underlying year-over-year growth, with solid execution across the entire portfolio. Planned turnarounds were successfully completed in Norway and Qatar, and Lower 48 production was also a record, averaging 1,063,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 709,000 from the Permian, 235,000 from the Eagle Ford, and 104,000 from the Bakken.\nLower 48 underlying production grew 8% year-on-year, with new wells online and strong well performance relative to our expectations across our asset base. Moving to cash flows, Q2 CFO was $4.7 billion at an average WTI price of $74 per barrel. This includes APLNG distributions of $405 million. In the Q2, we also received $200 million in proceeds, primarily related to a prior year disposition. Q2 capital expenditures were $2.9 billion, which included $624 million for long-cycle projects. Now, through the first half, we have now funded $700 million for Port Arthur LNG of the planned $1.1 billion for the year, which we expect to lead to a step down in overall capital in the second half. We also expect to see a step down in Lower 48 capital in the second half of the year.\nAs a result, we have narrowed our full-year capital guidance range to $10.8 to 11.2 billion, with no change to the midpoint. Regarding returns of capital, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in the Q2. This was via $1.3 billion in share buybacks and $1.4 billion in ordinary dividends and VROC payments. We announced a Q4 VROC of $0.60 per share, which has us on track to deliver our $11 billion target for total return of capital in 2023. Turning to guidance, we forecast Q3 production to be in a range of 1.78 to 1.82 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes 20,000 barrels a day of planned seasonal turnarounds, primarily in Alaska and Europe. We have also increased the midpoint of our full-year production guidance.\nOur new full-year range is 1.8 to 1.81 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 15,000 barrels per day from the prior midpoint of 1.78 to 1.8 million previously. For AP LNG, we expect distributions of $400 million in Q3 and $1.9 billion for the full year. Consistent with our higher production guidance for the year, we have raised our full-year adjusted operating cost and our DD&A guidance by $100 million each to $8.3 and $8.2 billion, respectively. We have also lowered our corporate cost guidance by $100 million to $800 million due to higher interest income. And finally, as a reminder, all guidance excludes any impact from announced but not closed acquisitions, such as Surmont and AP LNG. So to wrap up, we had another solid operational quarter. We're confident in our outlook, leading to our increase in full-year production guidance.\nWe continue to progress our strategic initiatives across the portfolio, and we expect to return $11 billion to shareholders this year. Now, that concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back over to the operators to start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one again. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone phone. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nWant to build on slide seven here on price realizations, as you mentioned, a little weaker in Lower 48 gas and Alaska. You had mentioned some of the stuff is transitory and it's moving in your direction in Q3. Can you provide a little more color there?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, absolutely, Neil. So obviously, Q2 was a bit challenging on our capture rates. And as you noted, that's particularly Lower 48 gas and Alaska crude. And I'll give you some details on each. But the punchline here is that we're already seeing Lower 48 gas differentials and Alaska crude pricing returning to more normal levels in Q3. And as I mentioned, based on strip and differentials for the rest of the year, we remain comfortable with our framework reference of $22 billion in CFO at $80 WTI and $3 Henry Hub that we provided at the beginning of the year, along with our published full-year price sensitivities. But let me start with Lower 48 gas. Our slides show that our Q2 capture rate was 68% of Henry Hub.\nThat's down from 85% in the Q1, which compares to our expectation of roughly 80% capture for the full year that we laid out a couple of quarters ago. As you probably recall, I said that we expected Lower 48 capture to be volatile quarter to quarter this year, and we are certainly seeing that. Now, the 68% rate in the Q1 was mostly driven by what we're seeing is still wide Permian differentials relative to Henry Hub for the first half of the year, as well as the absence of some strength in SoCal, and Bakken that we saw in the Q1, which really explains the quarter-to-quarter change. Now, looking at Q3, Permian differentials have narrowed back to more normal ranges. That's with some pipeline takeaway improvements and additional debottlenecking ahead. SoCal is looking a bit better as well.\nBut clearly, the story here is Permian Basin. That's what matters most. Now, on Alaska crude, this one's a bit more unique to ConocoPhillips. Capture rates slipped to 97% in Q2 from 101% in Q1. And that's largely timing related. With some of our Q2 cargoes, they were priced when ANS was trading at a discount to Brent. But as you can see on the screen right now, ANS is back to premium to Brent, more towards historic levels. So I'd say when we look at this and pull it all together, we remain encouraged by our recent capture rates. And we're confident in our full-year estimates and sensitivities. And we're pretty constructive on the second half of the year, Neil.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks, Bill. Really appreciate that. The follow-up is a small bump here in production guidance. It's been two quarters in a row where Lower 48 crude oil's come in strong above 560,000 barrels. So just curious on the driver of the bump. Was it in the Lower 48, or was it throughout the portfolio? And just your thoughts on production momentum over the course of the year.\n\nDominic Macklin\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Neil. It's Dominic here. Yeah, we're pretty pleased with production performance. I think it's really across the board. We're seeing everything perform well. But certainly, it is the Lower 48 that is standing out a little bit more. And Nick will talk to that in a minute. So you're right. Yeah, that's the Q2 that we've increased in a row our production guidance. We're up 25,000 BOE equivalent since the beginning of the year. And what's interesting, about 80% of that increase is actually oil. And so our full-year underlying growth is expected to be 3% to 4% this year. And that would be 7% to 8% in the Lower 48. Now, there is a lot of focus on product mix right now in the sector. So let me just say that we expect our product mix to be consistent over the year also.\nSo those growth numbers really work on both a BOE and a barrel of oil basis. We can get some noise on mix from quarter to quarter in the Lower 48, depending which particular pads are brought online across our basins. But that will average out over the year to a consistent product mix. So for example, if you look at our H2 2022 compared to H1 this year, we've had very consistent product mix in Lower 48, around 54% oil. So yeah, we're pleased with the production progress. Like I say, really, the Permian in the Lower 48 is driving that. So Nick, do you want to talk a little bit about that?\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive Vice President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Dominic. Good morning, Neil. Yeah, so probably two main reasons for that driver for the top end of the range in Lower 48. First, we had modest accelerations of activity, kind of late Q1 and Q2. Therefore, accelerating some wells online. And then strong well performance. Now, the accelerations that I mentioned were resulting from improved drilling and completion efficiency. So as I mentioned at the analyst and investor meeting, we continue to realize improved efficiencies in 2023, therefore accelerating some of the wells. So that's point number one. And then if you look at the overall strong well performance, we're seeing that across the board. So we're either at the 2022 performance or exceeding our type curves in certain areas as well. So that's, as Dominic mentioned, very encouraging.\nI will point out a couple of points on the drilling and completion efficiency that's making a large difference. We continue to realize efficiency improvements, for example, in our Permian real-time drilling intelligence group, where, Neil, we have 24/7 real-time monitoring where we can optimize the rig program. We can troubleshoot across the entire Permian rig fleet and then share best practices across the rigs as well. That's resulting in 10% improvement in ROP. We continue to high-grade rigs across the Lower 48 to drive and improve operational efficiency. On the fracking side, simul frack, remote frack, and we're testing out some new technology down in Eagle Ford, continuing to drive efficiency. So very encouraging.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, well done. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Dominic.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHello. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Mexico Pacific offtake agreement. Conceivably, you have a lot of looking at these types of deals. So why was this the right project for you? And also, what do you see the path to sort of FID and timing there? But we'd love to hear a little bit more about that and how it fits in the broader strategy.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, maybe, Steve, I'll take some of the broader strategy and then turn specifically over to Bill for the Saguaro project itself. But as we tried to lay out a game, kind of looking at a high level, we think from an energy transition perspective and just competency and what we're really good at on the LNG side, we wanted to expand that piece of our business. So we set out a couple of years ago to go do that. I think it's consistent with the Qatari volumes, of course, getting Port Arthur to FID, and now the Saguaro opportunity specifically on the West Coast.\nBut it's all in service to trying to build up a bigger LNG business inside the company and taking opportunities as they come available both on the equity side at Port Arthur, but more importantly, on the offtake side in trying to service some of the growing demand that we see coming out of Europe and Asia. I can have Bill talk more specifically about the Saguaro project.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure. As we talked at AIM, we're really focused on building up both our market and our originating highly competitive supply on a pretty stair-step basis. We're making excellent progress on both those fronts, Steve. As Ryan mentioned, we've secured 2.8 million tons of Regas at Germany. That supports our 2-million-ton offtake from our LNG SPAs with Qatar. That leaves 0.8 for our commercial LNG business. Putting that in perspective, that's 16% of Port Arthur LNG right there. We are continuing to make excellent progress advancing offtake into Europe. We've been progressing discussions with several Asian buyers. I'm really happy and pleased with how we're moving forward with developing market. Against that backdrop, we are pretty thrilled to be adding 2.2 million tons of offtake on the West Coast of Mexico. That's obviously pending successful FID by Mexico Pacific.\nBut you'll recall at AIM, we mentioned that we're really interested in adding West Coast LNG into our portfolio. This particular facility, it adds diversity to our offtake options. It avoids the Panama Canal. It's supportive of volumes into Asia. And from a supply perspective, it really does complement our offtake from Port Arthur very nicely. It creates some excellent optimization opportunities. You probably noticed it's got strong backing from very credible counterparties in addition to ConocoPhillips. And it supports a dedicated pipeline from the Permian. So that's always appreciated. It provides further takeaway optionality from the basin, which I think is helpful for Waha pricing. And it also is using ConocoPhillips Optimized Cascade technology. So there's quite a few reasons why we like having capacity at Saguaro. Now, note that it is an offtake agreement. There is not an equity component to this one. It is simply offtake.\nI think the most important point that Ryan's already mentioned is we continue to see really strong demand for LNG. So this fits quite nicely as we're kind of laddering our build-out of market and supply.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's great color, Bill and Ryan. Thank you. Bill, I just wanted to get his follow-up quickly on Surmont. It's been a little while since you exercised, but wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts on funding of that transaction and how you're thinking about it.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'm happy to. So let me just start with some overall context of how we're thinking about our cash balances and the acquisition of additional 50% interest. We ended the Q2 with a little over $7 billion of cash and short-term investments. And as we talked at AIM, that really provides strategic flexibility. It supports our investments in these mid- and longer-cycle projects and our shareholder distribution commitments. And when we look forward at the current strip, we expect that our organic sources and uses for the remainder of the year are going to be pretty balanced, Steve, and that our ending cash absent Surmont would be flattish with what we're seeing right now. Now, as Ryan mentioned, Surmont is a long-life asset. It's got a really great resource base.\nIt's one of these ideal assets to think about funding with debt because of its long-dated cash flows. You can match your assets and your liabilities pretty well with something like this. For the Surmont transaction specifically, and it's a bit tactical, but it's likely that we will use debt for a majority of the funding for Surmont. Then I just wrap up by pointing out, Ryan said in his remarks that the pricing that we're seeing right now, we see strong incremental CFO from that 50% increase in working interest of Surmont. That's starting to approach $1 billion of incremental CFO next year at $80. We're quite happy with the Surmont acquisition and quite comfortable with our funding plans.\n\nSteve Richardson\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's great. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Leggett with Bank of America.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nThank you for getting me on. Dom, I wonder if this is probably for you. I want to follow up on the question about well performance productivity, the terrific production performance, the raise that you've introduced today. But I want to ask it a slightly different way. Your partner in the Permian, specifically the Permian, I should say, has been talking about, I don't want to call it some magic formula or sauce or whatever, but their well productivity is off the charts. And you obviously are a big beneficiary of that. I'm wondering if you can comment as to whether there's any osmosis towards Conoco's operated production. And if you could maybe contrast and compare any differences you see between your 60% ownership position in the JV and your legacy position in the operated area around the Concho assets.\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive Vice President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Doug, this is Nick. I'll take a stab. I think you're looking at the non-operated versus operated split. Is that where you're going with that?\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nBasically, yeah. Yeah, exactly right.\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive Vice President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if you just take a look at that Q2 top end of the range performance from Lower 48, as I mentioned, we had strong performance both on accelerating the wells, but also strong well performance. That's roughly split between operated and non-operated. And obviously, when you look out in the Delaware, Oxy has a large component, but we have a number of other JV partners that are contributing to that as well. But Oxy has a big component.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nMaybe, do you say there's notable difference between the productivity in the JV and your legacy assets or no?\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive Vice President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYou know, we constantly, Doug, look at all benchmarking. So we receive the ballots from our non-operated positions. We evaluate it has to meet our cost framework. I'd say in general, we're fairly aligned. There's always a little bit of difference in spacing and stacking and completion design, but we're roughly in line. And obviously, the positions that we have in the operated position is really in the core, less than 12 billion barrels of resource, less than 40, averaging 32. We got great legacy positions out in the Delaware.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. Ryan, my follow-up is probably for you. You're adding $1 billion of cash flow from Surmont. Fantastic deal for you guys. Again, congratulations on that. You've evolved the LNG portfolio even since the analyst day. But yet, we still have one of the lowest ordinary dividend yields in the sector that you can clearly cover at very, very low oil prices. So I'm just wondering if I could ask you again to share your thoughts on whether some of that increase in free cash flow of the portfolio translates to a more ratable or a higher ordinary dividend, which frankly, we think you get better recognition for.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nNo, thanks, Doug. You've been a consistent messenger on this particular point.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nSorry. Predictable.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\ngive you credit for your tenacity, that's for sure. Look, yeah, we recognize that we're acquiring some assets that got significant free cash flow potential at $60 to 80, even at our mid-cycle price. I guess the thing I'd say first and foremost, Doug, is you shouldn't question ConocoPhillips' commitment to giving a significant amount of our cash flow back to our shareholders. So the last six, seven years, we've averaged 45%. This year, depending on your outlook for prices, we're probably closer to 50%. So first and foremost, we're going to be competitive on giving a significant amount of our cash back to shareholders. And again, that's CFO, not free cash flow. Now, to your point, even at a constant price, we're going to be generating more free cash flow as we come out of the APLNG and Surmont activity. Our framework really hasn't changed.\nLook, what we want on the base dividend is something that we said we see a lot of value in being able to grow that at a top quartile rate over time, over the long term. We intend to go do that. We set our framework around a mid-cycle price. You may differ or argue with our mid-cycle price, but we try to set a framework around a mid-cycle price. We want to buy some of our shares back through the cycles so we don't get caught pro-cyclically. Then we introduce that third tier of VROC to address when prices are well above mid-cycle. You'd argue $80 is well above mid-cycle. So I think our cash yield is competitive. I think your point is we may get more credit if we put a lot more into the base dividend.\nWe just think that growing the base dividend at a top-tier amount annually gives us a lot of credit as well and doesn't obviously raise the fixed costs of the company. But the improvements are we can afford a bit more, but we're focused on sort of the framework that we outlined and watching pretty volatile commodity prices. So I just remind people, just a month ago, WTI was back in the 60s. So we're trying to set a framework that we know works through the mid-cycle. And we set a framework that rewards the shareholders and recognizes the torque that the company has to the upside when prices are much higher. We like the three-tiered framework. We'll look at it again as we finish this year and go into 2024. We'll look at where our shares are trading. We'll look at where the commodity prices are at.\nWe'll try to set the channels appropriately. You can count on us delivering a significant amount of our cash flow back to our shareholders as we've done over the last six, seven years.\n\nDoug Leggate\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Oil and Gas, Bank of America\n\nI appreciate your patience with my question again. Thanks, Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam, your line is now open.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thanks so much. First, apologies if this is a little early, but I want to ask about 2024 capital if I can and maybe focus on Willow. There should be a natural tailwind in capital because the step-up in Willow is less than the Port Arthur payment. But I just wanted to see if there's anything we should know about project lifecycle at Willow that creates a different shape of spend over the development for 2024. Thank you.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Sam. It's Dominic here. It is a bit early for us to be talking about 2024, but there hasn't really been any change to the long-term framework we've had and what we talked about at AIM back in April. We showed there an expected capital range depending on how oil prices and inflation was trending. Given that WTI is back to around $80 and the forward curve is about there, as we have been anticipating, frankly, we'd expect to be at the higher end of that range that we talked about back in April. A similar capital level for next year to this year. I think one other dimension I'll talk about is how much growth in the Lower 48. What amount of growth do we need as a company? Do we want? Well, that's always an outcome of a plan.\nWe're always focused on returns, of course, returns on and off capital. But one of the things we're looking at next year is do we keep Lower 48 relatively flat? Is performing very well this year? Or do we add a little bit of activity? That's one of the things we're thinking about. In terms of the longer cycle capital, yes, LNG spend will be rolling off from this year over the next few years just as Willow picks up. We expect our longer cycle capital to average around 2 billion, pretty flat for the next few years here. So that would probably give you the pointers in terms of the general direction for next year. Like I say, it's pretty early, but that gives you a good sense of where our heads are at on that, so.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nUnderstood. Thanks. This is a follow-up on your point on Lower 48 and particularly sort of the phasing of your development because now with Mexico Pacific and Port Arthur, you've got quite a bit of evacuation from North America for gas. It integrates with your marketing team and through the supply agreement, which you talked about at the AIM. I wonder if thinking about those projects and their impact on maybe even NPV of some of your Permian positions with respect to realizations is a factor or if these are evaluated for you totally separately. Thanks.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. I mean, we don't really relate those investments specifically and directly, but it's obviously all helpful in terms of demand for North American gas. So that's in our minds, certainly as we think about the overall value equation of LNG in North America.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to build on what Sam was asking about and some of the comments you made just on inflation or deflation trends. You had some benchmarks baked into the multi-year guidance at the investor meeting earlier this year. We've seen some signs of deflation in US shale and some still rising costs in other pockets internationally. On a net basis across your portfolio, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing here in the back half of 2023 and then how that plays into the 2024 outlook to the extent you can comment.\n\nDominic Macklin\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Devin. Dominic again here. So yeah, obviously something we're watching incredibly closely with everybody else in the industry. I think we are seeing some areas of deflation in the Lower 48 going into the second half. I would say, however, we still expect our overall company capital inflation to average out in the mid-single digits this year versus last year on an annual basis. But just to talk a little bit about what we're seeing, I mean, certainly, I think as we've said before, tubulars, we've seen some significant price relief on any oil price-related commodities, fuel, and chemicals and things. We've seen some material reductions in sand and proppant. Rig rates have softened a bit, and that's obviously driven by the gas basin. So you're starting to see some high-performance rigs come in and compete with the oilier basin.\nSo that is, we are seeing some day rates come down there. And I would say, I think we are beginning to see some examples of frac spread rates coming down in some basins. So that's all looking positive. Activity internationally and offshore is picking up. It's probably as high as it's been for many years. So we are seeing some pressure on labor rates there. So we're watching that. But overall, certainly seeing some deflation going into the second half. And that's a big part of the reason we see a lower capital run rate for the second half for the first half. That's an important part of it. And that's all reflected in our annual capital guidance that we have narrowed to $10.8 to 11.2 billion. $11 billion still our midpoint. But certainly, we're seeing turning the corner here with inflation and moving into deflation again.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. And then I wanted to separately come back to the LNG strategy. One of the other opportunities that you had talked about at the investor meeting was brownfield expansion at Port Arthur. And we've seen with some other US Gulf Coast projects very compelling economics on the additional trains that can get added. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the commercialization process there and Conoco's appetite for taking further off-take off of further expansion at that facility?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, this is Bill. We talked about this a bit at AIM. So as we think about Port Arthur LNG, we're pretty happy with the level of equity that we have right now in the project. When we took equity, that had some pretty unique reasons for taking it for the options that we secured there. And so as we look forward, it would have to make there have to be some pretty unique reasons why we take additional equity. Now, as we have mentioned, that our agreements are structured for future phases continue to benefit our investment in the phase I. And so we're pretty positive on that. And as you know, we've got some predefined options on that. We're certainly evaluating options. But I think that you should kind of have in your mind that we're not expecting to spend additional capital there at this point in time.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of John Royal with J.P. Morgan.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JP Morgan\n\nYep. Well, thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYes, we can.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JP Morgan\n\nOkay. Sorry. It looks like the tax rate on your corporate segment earnings took a big step up in Q2. So I was just hoping you could speak to the tax rate on corporate. And then I think it impacted just the overall blended rate, stepped down a bit in Q2. So just maybe a little bit of color on that as well would be helpful, and just what we should expect moving forward with the tax rate.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, this is Bill. This is really just a pre-tax income mix story. Our estimated annualized effective tax rate has moved down to 35% for the year. That compares to last time I provided guidance to y'all of mid to upper 30s when we talked sometime last year on our effective tax rates. And this reflects a shift in the mix of our forecast annual pre-tax income from some higher tax jurisdictions to lower tax jurisdictions. It's really largely driven by Norway, given the reduction that we've seen recently in EU gas prices relative to last year. So obviously, these tax rate changes, they create some quarterly noise as they flow through as a non-cash catch-up adjustment when they happen. And so that's why you see our Q2 tax rate was 33.6% versus Q1 of 36%.\nThat puts our year-to-date right at this 35% level, matching our current expectation of full year. Now, that non-cash adjustment, that's going to flow through the corporate and other segments. You can see that on our supplementary disclosures. You can see it's a $200 million positive swing quarter on quarter in that corporate segment. Now, so that's pretty straightforward. It's really just a mixed story. Now, when you think about deferred tax, the positive tailwind that you saw on the cash flow statements quarter on quarter was a bit lower. That was because of the income statement adjustment I just talked about. The bottom line is for the second half of the year, 35% annualized effective tax rate is a reasonable run rate for book tax at our current commodity prices.\nThe deferred tax tailwind of about $200 million for Q2, that's also a good run rate for the remainder of the year. Now, obviously, that can move around a lot if there's some discrete items that come up. And as you know, they often do. But it's a pretty good run rate at this point in time.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JP Morgan\n\nAll right. That's really helpful. Thanks, Bill. Then my next question is on Bakken production. You were up well over 100 KBD in Q2. What was the driver of the strength there? And should we be thinking about Bakken as plateauing somewhere above that kind of mid- to high 90s that we used to think about? Or is there any stickiness to the strength in Q2?\n\nNick Olds\n\nExecutive Vice President of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, John, this is Nick. Yeah, if you look at our operational performance from the rigs and frac crew that we have in the Bakken, just performing extremely strong. Like other assets in the portfolio, you're going to see a little bit of lumpiness from quarter to quarter. You can think of Bakken at plateau. So 100,000 barrels a day for several years is a good number. I would refer you to the AIM presentation where we talked about Eagle Ford and Bakken, essentially sustaining production for 330,000 through the decade. That'll give you a good long-term view. We like the asset as competitive, low cost of supply, and we continue to find opportunities and looking to increase the overall inventory in that asset.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JP Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Roger Reed with Wells Fargo.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nIt broke off, but I'll assume I'm the only Roger on the call. Good morning, guys.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nGood morning, Roger.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to come back around. You've had some opportunities here on the investment and the acquisition front with Surmont and the deal here in Mexico. So I was just sort of curious, as you look at, let's call it the M&A opportunity versus the organic opportunity, how are you comparing those two? How are the opportunities looking on those? Thinking returns, right? Where to put your incremental dollar?\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, right now, I think we're pretty focused on the organic side, Roger, but just because of the resource space right now and the stuff that we're executing, it's got pretty compelling opportunity for the company to focus most of our capital and our allocation towards our organic side of the business. When it's performing as well as it is, we're delivering the efficiencies that Nick talked about in the Lower 48 and what Andy's delivering around the rest of the world. That just looks to be compelling opportunities for the company. But with that said, you hang around the hoop and you catch these rebounds a little bit because we never know when our partners in some of these assets make different strategic decisions, which is clearly what our partner at APLNG has done or is doing.\nWhat's clearly what our partner at Surmont has done and is doing. We know these assets really well. We've tried to; we're consistent in the framework around cost of supply that we described to you a number of years ago of how we kind of match up inorganic opportunities with organic opportunities. That's why we want to have the financial strength that we do with cash on the balance sheet and the ability to fund these projects when they come available. You just never know when your partner makes the kind of decisions that they have made. When we know the assets well and we can get it for a deal that's very competitive, as you talked about, vis-à-vis Surmont and APLNG for that matter, we're going to be all over those when those opportunities present themselves. We never quite know when they do.\nSo we're mostly focused on the organic side of the portfolio, but we want to have the firepower and be there. And we watch everything. We pay attention to everything that's going on in the market. We know what we like, and we know what we can afford to pay, more importantly. And when we can bring those two together, we want to be able to execute those when those opportunities present themselves. And it was really opportunistic with both APLNG and Surmont. We had partners that made strategic decisions to go in a different direction. And that was to our advantage. So we wanted to take advantage of that.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAbsolutely. Thanks for that. Just as a follow-up question on the agreement to go the LNG route on the West Coast of Mexico, what is the situation with takeaway capacity to get there, presumably from the Permian? Just what pipelines or what pipelines might need to be constructed in order to make this project or bring it to fruition?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Roger, this is Bill. Two points. First, the 2.2 million tons from Saguaro, that is an offtake agreement. It's not an equity investment. I just think it's important to make sure that that's clear. For the specific question about the pipelines, I'd really direct you to the operator, Mexico Pacific, for a detailed answer. They've had several press releases out, including one in July that announced a 20-year agreement with CFE. That's the Comisión Federal de Electricidad in Mexico to supply Mexico Pacific with natural gas delivered from the Permian Basin via CFE's pipelines in Mexico. And so that's the best source of information for you on that. And of course, that takeaway from the Permian is helpful for Waha differentials and pricing overall. Okay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan, your line is now open.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nSorry, I cut out there for a second and missed it. Maybe one follow-up question on the Saguaro LNG off-take, or at least a broader question on off-take agreements. You've got that off-take agreement now. You've got the 5 million tons from Port Arthur. When you look at your interest in off-take agreements in LNG, is there a relative size in terms of how much feels appropriate in the portfolio relative to equity gas production, either on a global basis or in the US relative to kind of US gas versus off-take agreements? How are you thinking about partially which is, should we expect to see you look at additional off-take agreements, or do you feel like you've got a pretty good balance at this point in the portfolio?\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, that's a really interesting question. So as we've laid out, we think about this as building up in kind of a ladder fashion. You have to have the market placement with the LNG off-take that you secure. We feel very comfortable with where we're at in that progress, even just since AIM in April. So that's why you're seeing us being pretty confident with our West Coast volumes here. But you should expect that to kind of develop as a ladder. So you don't get out ahead of your skis. We do see pretty strong demand on that. But I think we're getting pretty close to critical mass here over time. So I think we're pretty comfortable with where we're at right now. We're continuing to look for capacity on the West Coast, but a lot of those things are more longer dated out in time right now.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat. Thank you. And then maybe, and I apologize, I'm not sure if you said something on this or I missed the first minute of the prepared comments, but any comments on the latest update on Alaska, particularly regarding the outstanding legal or permitting issues that would dictate timing there at Willow?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, hi, this is Andy. So yeah, so for Alaska, on the legal front, as you recall, we had the two lawsuits that were challenging the federal government's approval for the project. So probably the main update since we last spoke is we're pleased that a schedule has been agreed now, and we expect to see a ruling on that in November. As we previously communicated, given the prior rulings on this, the scope of what's being challenged is narrow. And we believe that the BLM, the cooperating agencies, have conducted a thorough process and satisfied all the legal requirements. So we're kind of very much now looking forward to the court's ruling in November as we start to plan for our 2024 winter season.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks for squeezing me in. I just have a couple of quick questions on long-cycle. You talked about long-cycle development and then deflation comments. And whether maybe you could take that to Willow. You FID'd what seemed like peak inflation, and then some important costs have come down. So wondering whether you have a cost update there or I guess whether you expect costs to come down. And I understand it's a six-year project, but.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey, Lloyd, this is Andy again. So Willow is a longer-term project. It is a little hard to comment on sort of deflation and inflation through 2029. But I guess it is important just to frame it. Willow is not a turnkey contract. And as we are entering into individual contracts, those contracts do have terms linked to agreed indices that can move up and down with inflation. So probably just a couple of other things I'd mention is that we haven't seen the same kind of inflation in Alaska as we've seen in the Lower 48 over the last couple of years. So as we said in AIM, I think in terms of the capital range, that still holds. We expect the capital range to be in the $7 to 7.5 billion. And that really hasn't changed from the CapEx to first production.\nAnd it's probably just also worth emphasizing, like all of our projects, Willow has got some inflation factored into those estimates. So we understand the project really well. This kind of activity is sort of a lot of this is sort of typical activity we do in Alaska. And we haven't seen the same kind of inflation that we have in the Lower 48. So I think the $7 to 7.5 billion that we provided at AIM is still a good estimate of what our thinking is in terms of the CapEx to first production.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, great. And then let me just go back to Surmont. I know you've answered a few questions on it, but it kind of fell into your laps. And whether the exercise of the ROFR changes any strategic capital decisions elsewhere in the portfolio, it feels like it gives you a lot of flexibility going forward, but I was just wondering if it changes the timing on any other projects. I was thinking Montney or anything like that.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nAs you said, Surmont, one of the things that we really like about Surmont is it's a low capital intensity asset. So it really doesn't change that much in terms of allocating capital to other projects. It's just providing us a lot more cash flow. So I think the plan we outlined at AIM, it doesn't really change how we consider the other projects. And we have the benefit of another long-cycle asset with low capital intensity.\n\nLloyd Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Alistair Syme with Citi.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks very much. Sorry, back on LNG again. I just wonder if you could talk about the three opportunities you've taken on in the last 12, 18 months about how they compare on a cost-to-supply basis once you put together costs and fiscal, how it all comes together. Thank you.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I think.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nSo if you look.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nGo ahead, Bill.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure. So if you look at the projects we've picked up, so in Qatar, those are really nice projects that we've pursued for a long period of time. Those compete very well on our cost of supply. We're quite happy with those. Port Arthur, we've talked about pretty extensively. We've talked about how Port Arthur, on an integrated basis, that we'd expect low to mid-teens returns overall, but with really steady cash flow and low-risk returns on that equity component. And then Saguaro is not an equity investment.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nAlthough there's still an inherent cost of supply associated with it, isn't there, in terms of how you're thinking about the market position?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure. So that comes down to what your cost of supply into your portfolio. We think that Saguaro is quite competitive because it's on the West Coast, particularly when you compare that to Gulf Coast LNG because you're on the other side of the Panama Canal. And so it's a quite competitive supply location for deliveries, particularly into Asia, and fits very nice in terms of if you think of an acquisition cost for LNG. It's very competitive.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nCan I have an add, Alistair, for the? Yeah, we look at the liquefaction fee. Our reason for choosing Port Arthur and obviously MPL is what we believe is a very, very competitive liquefaction fee. Avoiding some of the costs through the Panama Canal then places it at a premium to Asian buyers.\n\nAlastair Syme",
    "content2": "Managing Director, Citi\n\nOkay. Thank you. But my follow-up, probably to Dominic, I think you hinted with the question on 2024 CapEx that you're sort of evaluating Lower 48 activity levels. And I was just sort of wondering what is sitting behind that? Is it something about taking advantage of the deflation you're seeing, or is it related to what you're seeing on well productivity?\n\nDominic Macklin\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Alistair. I mean, it's really looking at the performance of the Lower 48 this year. I mean, it's doing very well. We've got a very efficient machine running. As we think about returns, we think about the growth that we are likely to see from the Lower 48, even at relatively flat levels. We will see growth, we anticipate, even at maintaining flat activity levels. So we're just looking overall and saying, yeah, looking at the macro and so on and just saying how much growth do we think is appropriate. So that's just something that we're considering. We haven't made any decisions on that yet. But yeah, it's just a case of fine-tuning that as we think about 2024.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nBrilliant. Thanks for the answers, everyone.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nOperator, do we have time for one more question?\n\nOperator\n\nThis question comes from a line of Josh Silverstein with UBS.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHey, morning, guys. So in Mexico as well, you guys have the option and offtake, I think, potential equity agreement at Costa Azul as well. What are the key differences between the two projects, and why the first one with Mexico Pacific versus the Costa Azul project?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I think the key difference is a timing issue right now. The Mexico Pacific is available right now. It's getting ready to take FID. It's in a good location with a very competitive tariff. Even as we're marketing today, that would be accretive and in the money based on the tariff rates that we're looking at. So we do have options for ECA, Energía Costa Azul on the West Coast through our interest in Port Arthur Phase I. But that's more longer dated. That project is not yet ready to consider taking FID, and there's a bit of time to go on it. So it's a timing issue of when they'd start up. But we continue to hold that option for West Coast.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGot it. And then as you guys are putting together your portfolio, are you trying to optimize the exposure you have to both the Atlantic and Pacific basins and maybe discuss some of the key differences you see or risks you see between both sides? Thanks.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. So certainly, as we put the portfolio together, we're looking at a diversified portfolio of off-take. We are actively developing placement into Europe. We're developing long-term delivered opportunities into Asia. And we're considering some sales FOB at the facilities that are in the money right now. We also are thinking about these in a time horizon basis with a mix of shorter and longer-term dates as a portfolio. And we'll be using our commercial organization to optimize across that value chain. So yes, we are looking at actively building out both European and Asian market and doing that through a variety of formats and time horizons.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

During the question and answer session, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone phone. I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Michelle, and welcome to everyone to our Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklon, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability, and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Global Operations; and Tim Leach, Advisor to the CEO.\nRyan and Bill will kick off the call with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders: first, along with today's release, we publish supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the investor relations website. Second, during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\nActual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. Finally, we will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Since we just hosted our Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared remarks fairly brief. Today, ConocoPhillips delivered a strong Q1 result, setting a new production record for the company as well as in the Lower 48. Underlying production growth was 4% year-on-year, including 8% year-on-year growth in the Lower 48.\nWe are confident in our outlook for the rest of the year, and we are increasing the midpoint of our full-year production guidance. We're keeping our full-year capital and operating guidance unchanged. Shifting to returns on and of capital, we continue to demonstrate our returns-focused value proposition in Q1.\nOur return on capital employed once again exceeded our goal of being top quartile in the S&P 500, and as we highlighted at the recent analyst and investor meeting, we remain confident in our ability to achieve this objective in a mid-cycle price environment. Over the course of our 10-year plan. On return of capital, we are on track to deliver on our planned $11 billion for 2023, which represents greater than 50% of our projected CFO and is highly competitive with peers, and we are able to achieve all of this while investing in our attractive mid- and long-term opportunities.\nOur Q1 was also quite busy from a strategic perspective. At Port Arthur LNG we acquired a 30% equity interest in the joint venture upon final investment decision on phase I. At Willow we are pleased to receive a positive record of decision and began road construction. And at APLNG we announced plans to become upstream operator following the closing of EIG's transaction with Origin and to purchase up to an additional 2.49% in the project. We also accelerated our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction target to 50% to 60% versus a 2016 baseline as we further advance our net zero operational emissions ambition.\nI know everyone has the question on Surmont, so let me address that right now. We acknowledge that we received our Right of First Refusal notice and we're certainly reviewing it carefully now. In conclusion, as we shared at our analysts and investor meeting last month, our deep, durable, and diversified asset base is well positioned to generate solid returns and cash flow for decades to come. As I said then, we challenge any other E&P company to show you a plan with this kind of duration. Now let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our Q1 performance in more detail.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, thanks Ryan. In Q1 2023, we generated $2.38 per share in adjusted earnings. Q1 production was a record for the company at 1,792,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day driven by solid execution across the entire portfolio. The Eagle Ford stabilizer expansion and our three planned turnarounds were both successfully completed, and Lower 48 production was also a record averaging 1,036,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, including 694,000 from the Permian, 227,000 from the Eagle Ford, 98,000 from the Bakken, and Lower 48 Underlying production grew 8% year-on-year with new wells online and strong well performance relative to our expectations across our asset base.\nNow moving to cash flows, Q1 CFO was $5.7 billion excluding working capital at an average WTI price of $76 per barrel. This included APLNG distributions of $764 million. Now Q1 capital expenditures were $2.9 billion including $400 million for Port Arthur phase I and $100 million in Lower 48 acquisitions.\nRegarding Port Arthur, as you will recall from our Q4 call, we said we plan to spend about $1.1 billion in 2023. Q1 spending was fairly front-end loaded relative to the full year.\nIn Q1, we also received $200 million in disposition proceeds. Regarding capital allocation, we returned $3.2 billion back to shareholders. This was via $1.7 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in ordinary dividends and VROC payments.\nTurning to guidance, we forecast Q2 production to be in a range of 1.77 to 1.81 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes 10,000 to 15,000 of planned seasonal turnarounds. We have also increased the midpoint of our full year production guidance by 10,000 barrels a day. Our new range is 1.78 to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent, up from 1.7 to 1.8 million previously. For APLNG, we expect distributions of $350 to 400 million in Q2. For the full year, we expect APLNG distributions of $1.8 billion. All other guidance items remain unchanged.\nTo wrap up, we had a strong Q1. We remain confident in our outlook leading to our increase in full year production guidance, and we expect to return $11 billion to our shareholders this year. We're well-positioned to deliver on our commitments throughout this year. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call back over to Phil.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bil. So, before we move to Q&A, just a quick reminder here that we are sticking to one question per caller this quarter, since we just hosted the analyst day a few weeks ago and is obviously quite a busy earnings day for everybody. So with that, Michelle, let's move to the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one. If you are using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one one on your touchtone phone. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\nThe first question comes from Stephen Richardson with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thank you. Ryan, I was wondering if you could talk on the return of capital. Obviously outperforming, you know, 50% of cash flow from ops and setting up, you know, really strongly versus the $11 billion target. Just wondering if you could address, you know, the environment is not straightforward. There's a lot of volatility out there. And just from a shareholder's perspective, how do you think about balancing, you know, VROC buyback and just the general flexibility as people consider kind of the volatility in the commodity environment?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Stephen. I think I'll start just by recognizing the volatility that's currently in the market. But even with that, as we look at Q1 average prices were in the mid-70s WTI. Quarter-to-date in Q2, and they're in the high 70s. So that's close enough to our planning framework that we set out early in the year, that's close enough to $80, and delivering the $22 billion in cash for the year. So we're not going to overreact to kind of what we're seeing in the volatility right now.\nSo we're on track. And hopefully you see that with the VROC that we set for Q3, on track to deliver the $11 billion distributions that we set out at the beginning of the year. We're comfortable with that.\nWe have the balance sheet to support it if prices turn out a little bit lower as well. So, you know, it would take a structural change, and we certainly don't view this volatility we're seeing right now as a structural change in the marketplace in terms of the mix and the balance. You know, we said we'd do about 50% shares. We leaned in a little bit in Q1 on the shares. But through the year, we expect to be about 50-50 between our VROC and the shares to deliver the $11 billion of returns back to the shareholder. Hopefully, you see that with the Q3 setting of the VROC at $0.60 a share, that should give you comfort that we're on track to deliver that.\n\nStephen Richardson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you so much.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nGreat. Thanks, Steve. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nYeah, thank you so much. And congrats on a really good Lower 48 quarter in particular. Ryan, I think you, you sort of cut ahead of this question, but I'd love you to comment to the extent you can on Surmont, recognizing it's an active situation and you know, as you think about that asset, first of all, it seems from the analyst day that it is a core position for you guys. And just any thoughts on, you know, whether it makes sense to be a bigger part of the portfolio to the extent you can comment at all?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYes, Neil, thanks. No, I can let Andy maybe make a few comments about the asset which would be kind of reiterating what we said at the analyst meeting. But, yeah, we're in receipt of the notice on the transaction between Total and Suncor. We have a right on the Surmont asset, which we know really well because we own 50% and operate it. So we're in the process of taking a pretty serious look at that. I can maybe have Andy reiterate some of our thoughts about the asset that we described in the analyst meeting.\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nGood morning, Neil. Yes, as we said in the, you know, the analyst meeting, you know, we do like Surmont as a nice sort of long life, low capital intensity asset for us, you know, as we, because we covered in the analyst meeting, you know, that low capital intensity is an important part of our portfolio. And just to sort of reiterate that sort of the maintenance capital on Surmont, you know, I'm just, I'm referring now to our 50% share of Surmont. It's been in the $20 to 30 million a year range for the last four or five years. And you'll recall I mentioned that we're, we're drilling our first new pad since 2016. Now that pad, for example, it will be in the $40 to 50 million.\nSo it's a very, you know, it's a very low capital intensity asset for us with that sort of basically flat production profile. And as you know, sort of pretty much all of our other driver information we disclose in terms of our production data, our bitumen realizations, and our operating costs. That's all out there. So you can form your own view on the asset. But it's an asset that is a core asset in our portfolio. We'll probably just stop there.\n\nNeil Mehta\n\nHead of Americas Natural Resources Equity Research, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nGreat color. Thanks, guys.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Neil. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning. I guess I'd like to follow up on Port Arthur LNG. Obviously the phase I was covered. There's always a possibility of greater expansion in LNG. Just what would be the things we would watch coming up in terms of the second phase?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure, Roger, this is Bill. As we talked about at the analyst investor meeting, we're currently really satisfied with 30% for phase I and our five million tons equity offtake. We're prioritizing market development over any additional offtake in equity. Right now we really think we've got sufficient capital allocation to Port Arthur and we're looking for ways to optimize our current investment. Our plate's pretty full and we don't need to allocate significant additional capital in the near term. There need to be some pretty unique reasons to make it attractive.\n\nRoger Read\n\nSenior Energy Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, clear enough. I'll stick to the one. Thanks.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Roger.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Doug Leggett with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nKalei Akamine\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning guys. This is actually Kalei on for Doug, so thanks for taking the question. My question is to follow up on Surmont. Our understanding is that Suncor could receive certain tax benefits as part of their deal. I'm wondering if those tax benefits would be available to you if you exercise your Right of First Refusal. I'm asking the question because I think yours would look more like an asset deal while theirs is just more of a corporate deal.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, as we said, Kalei, that we're currently reviewing the proposal that we got, and the terms and the conditions, so it's a bit early to comment on tax pools.\n\nKalei Akamine\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Your line's open.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHello. Thanks for taking the question.You know, the capital efficiency looks like it's going in the right direction with the production guidance and the capital plan in line at the analyst day. You made some comments where you thought it was at least possible that you could start to see inflation ease, if not reverse. The question is, just as you think about this production result, is that an outcome of, you know, maybe an opportunity to press activity a little bit as costs are easing or is this a, is it more of a, well, results-driven outcome? Thank you.\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Sam, it's Dominic here just to talk to inflation a little bit first. I think, you know, overall our capital inflation for the company, we still expect to be in the mid single digits year-over-year. So we certainly see that leveling off.\nAs you mentioned before, you know, we've certainly seen deflationary trends in steel tubulars, oil-price-related commodities such as fuel and chemicals. Beyond that, on the rig, frac, and other services, they've certainly leveled off. We may be trending towards some reductions. We have seen rig counts peak and begin to decline. That's led by the gas basins. So our teams are very focused on costs, and they're working with our many service providers on that. But we still expect around the mid-single digits at this stage on inflation.\nHaving said that, we certainly see capital efficiency coming through. I think that's really on an execution front. So we've had a strong start, particularly in the Lower 48. Our full-year production guidance, as we've said, is up at the midpoint. We do expect low- to mid-single-digits growth for the year.\nThat's pretty consistent with the long-term 4% to 5% CAGR we presented at our investor meeting. And yet we're holding our capital range the same with $11 billion at the midpoint. So we're definitely seeing some execution efficiency. We're pleased about that. Nick, you may want to talk a little bit more about the Lower 48 on that.\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nAll right, thanks Dom. Yeah Sam, just take you back to the analyst call. When we talked about drilling and completions efficiency, if you recall we had from 2019 to 2022 we had a 50% improvement in drilling, 60% improvement in completion at stages per day. We continue to see that in Q1, you know very promising results and that's the use of you know technology like simul-frac, E-frac.\nWe're testing out some remote frac as well where we keep a frac spread on pad one and then we frac pad two, pad three, pad four. So very promising results there as well. On the drilling front we continue to use data analytics and rig automation but all it's coming together so really lead to some accelerated placing on production of wells in Q1 driving some of the overperformance.\n\nSam Margolin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you so much.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks Sam. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from John Royall with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan Chase\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. So my question is just on Willow. Are there any updates there to how the lawsuits are progressing, and are you any closer to a resolution there and getting to FID than when we last saw you a few weeks ago at the AIM?\n\nAndy O'Brien\n\nSVP of Global Operations, ConocoPhillips\n\nHey John, this is Andy. Yeah, there's really not too much new to comment on over the last few weeks. So the only incremental news we've had has all been positive. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied motions attempting to stop our construction work. So we've been progressing with the winter season, and we've had gravel extraction and road construction underway. It's pretty much going as we expected it would in the last two or three weeks. Not much more to add than we talked about at the Analyst Investor Day.\n\nJohn Royall\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThank you.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks. Ryan, maybe one for you following up on the analyst day. But what impact if any did you increase your view of the mid-cycle oil price from $50 to $60. What impact if any does that have on the way in which you think about the business? You're still focused on low cost to supply assets well below this price. Does the view that oil prices would be structurally higher over time have any impact on the way you think about managing the business over the long term? Your balance sheet allocation of capital or, or anything else?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nNo thanks, Ryan. In terms of how we're running the company day to day and the allocation of capital that we put in each year, really doesn't. We're only investing in things that have a cost of supply less than $40 WTI in the portfolio. So what a mid-cycle price change. Our chief economist office, our commercial team, we go through a process every year where we take a current view of the macro and have a long-range view of what we think is happening.\nAnd as we've gone through a lot of turmoil in the business, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, just the lack of investment going into the business these days, we stepped back and did our own bottoms-up, which we do every year. But important this year we did our own bottoms-up work.\nTry to understand where we think the mid-cycle price is moving to and what it was. It's staying at kind of that $50 level. Our assessment of the price required to generate that incremental barrel to meet that incremental demand. Our assessment put it at around $60 today.\nSo the implications of that are really just how much cash flow we think we're going to be generating as we interrogate the portfolio, as we invest in the growth and development of the company, and we put capital into the company. The way it manifests itself is just how much cash flow are we going to deliver at that kind of a mid-cycle price, which is obviously a little bit more than what we would deliver at the lower price.\nSo it goes to sort of how we think about cash on the balance sheet, how we think about the debt that we're carrying, how we think about distributions, and how much capacity there is to distribute a bunch of our cash, which are commitments above 30%. And when we get above mid-cycle price in our case like we are today, obviously we're generating a lot more cash and we're returning a lot more cash to the shareholder now, something, you know, in excess of 50% today. But that's driven by the low reinvestment rate that we have in the company and our commitment to only invest in the lowest cost supply things we have in the portfolio.\n\nRyan Todd\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks, Ryan.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, operator. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to go back to the Lower 48. It was helpful detail before on some of the efficiencies that you're seeing there. I think one of the other drivers of the strength in production that you called out in the prepared remarks was, well, performance beating your expectations. Can you talk a little bit more explicitly about what you're seeing there and if there's any development changes that you've made driving that uplift?\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Devin, this is Nick. You're right. Strong well performance was definitely a contributing factor for Q1. You know, if I take you back to the Q4 call, I had mentioned that our well performance was meeting or exceeding type curve expectations, and we continue to see that trend into Q1. So that's very encouraging. You know, no overall development changes. We're just seeing very promising results across all assets. This is just not the Permian as well.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, you know, the completion and drilling efficiency has allowed us to accelerate some wells earlier into Q1. And so we're seeing that production come into play. And then on the Eagle Ford stabilization plant that we've upgraded, the team just did a remarkable job in sheltering the amount of downtime in Q1. So we had less DT, but overall, very strong quarter.\n\nDevin McDermott\n\nManaging Director of Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Devin.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Just some questions around, you know, potential LNG opportunities in the future. You mentioned at the analyst day that you have, you know, options around Port Arthur, phase II, III, and IV, and even at Costa Azul as well. Can you just give some more details around the options? You know, does it need to be at the 30% like you did in phase I of Port Arthur? Or could it be 10% or some other agreement there? Could it be before or after FID as well? And then just along the same lines, because there will already be some infrastructure in the ground for phase I. You know, will the capital outlay for phase II or III be less because of that?\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. So, you know, I think we laid this out pretty well at our analyst meeting. So for Port Arthur, we've got options on both equity and offtake for future phases. Those can be executed either for equity offtake or both as they present themselves through time. We also have some options on the west coast of Mexico at Energy Costa Azul on phase II. And so those are long-dated options that we continue to look at. I talked a bit about phaseI I earlier in the call.\nAnd so there need to be some pretty unique opportunities on that as we think about that right now. Now, as we think about future phases, we have structured our investment in phase I such that we benefit from the economies of scale for future phases on our phase I investment. So future phases actually benefit phase I.\n\nJosh Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Paul Cheng, Scotiabank. Your line is open.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe this is for Nick. Nick, in the United States, if we eyeball look like you are talking about 2023, the shale oil production around 1MMbpd, and in Q1 you're already there, does that mean that for the rest of the year that the Lower 48, shale oil and Montney together, will be pretty stretched, or that that number is somewhat conservative now?\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Paul, this is Nick. You're right. I mean, we had a very strong performance in Q1, as we just described. As you look at the future quarters of this year, we've got some larger pad projects, longer horizontal wells, and kind of put that in context. We got 80% of our 2023 Permian wells are 2mi or greater, and we got, you know, fairly large portion that are the 3mi. But you're going to see kind of small variations. But overall that's going to be relatively flat. But I'll leave you with this point. Our plan will deliver at least mid single digits for Lower 48.\n\nPaul Cheng\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nRight, thanks. Okay.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nUS Exploration and Production Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, thanks. I just wonder if you could provide some updated commentary, if you have any, on Venezuela. You know, about a month ago there was some talks about kind of easing sanctions there. And, you know, you all have a potential big asset, you know, or at least value that at one point in time we're looking to extract. Is there any update on that, or is there any kind of color you can talk about, like the progress and remind us of the value there?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Scott. Yeah, we're right in the middle of all those conversations, as you might imagine, including the most recent conversations around the Citgo refining assets. You know, we're in the queue. We're in the right in the middle of anything that would happen there. We have a, as a reminder, an ICC judgment of $2 billion. We've collected about $700 million on that judgment to date. So we have an outstanding what they owe us on that particular judgment. We're in an appeal process with ICSID, which is the other tribunal, and that's an $8 billion potential award coming.\nNow, there's some overlap between the two, so you can't necessarily add the two together. But I guess the point is they owe us a lot of money and we're hard at trying to get some resolution of that. The recent news out of the judge and the US government around Citgo is certainly helpful in that regard. It looks like, you know, despite the sanctions that are on the Venezuelans and on US companies for doing work in Venezuela, there's a little bit of some light developing at the end of that tunnel and we're right in the middle of it all.\n\nScott Hanold\n\nUS Exploration and Production Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAll right, good to hear. Thanks.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Alastair Syme with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nGlobal Head of Energy Research, Citi\n\nHello, everybody. In your remarks at the beginning on the Lower 48, you mentioned about infrastructure build. I was really just interested to try and understand across the Lower 48, but I guess especially in the Permian, what's the sort of ratio of capital that's going into infrastructure versus drilling? I guess there's changes over the life of the assets. So I'm just kind of intrigued. At what sort of point of asset life are we in terms of that ratio?\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, I'm not sure the exact ratio. Maybe Nick might have some numbers. But I think, you know, most of what we're doing is large pad development with, you know, not single well facilities but central facilities supporting those large pads. I don't know what the split between drilling and infrastructure spend is. I can let Nick have a comment, but I don't think it's much different than what we've been doing for the past few years.\n\nNick Olds\n\nEVP of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, Alastair, it's very limited as far as on the infrastructure span, most of your expenditures is on drilling and completions in the Permian as an example.\n\nAlastair Syme\n\nGlobal Head of Energy Research, Citi\n\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Alistair.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Raphaël DuBois with Societe Generale. Your line is open.\n\nRaphaël Dubois\n\nEquity Analyst, Societe Generale\n\nHello. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one question about the working capital deterioration in Q1. I was wondering if you could tell us how much of it is due to some Norwegian cash tax catch up and what is it to expect for the rest of the year?\n\nBill Bullock\n\nEVP and CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, sure. Happy to talk about working capital.\nSo if you look at working capital for Q1, you can see that in the supplementary documents we put out on our website: Q1 was about $100 million use of working capital. For Q2, we'd expect that to be just over $1 billion. And as you rightly noted, that's associated with Norwegian tax payments, which is normal for operators in Norway. We accrued those in 2022. They're payable in Q2 2023, and then looking for the rest of the year, assuming we don't see FX rates move materially for the remainder year, we'd expect we wouldn't really expect any material working capital movements across Q3 or Q4. So hope that helps for kind of full year view.\n\nRaphaël Dubois\n\nEquity Analyst, Societe Generale\n\nThank you.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Neil Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is open, Neil.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist Securities\n\nMy question is on shareholder return plan. Specifically, what do you all view, sort of in broad terms, as an optimal quarterly payout, given, I guess, now how even more volatile the commodity market continues to be? And looking at your most recent, I guess the PAT was a bit over 100%.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman and CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah. Well, I think, Neal, you have to kind of go back to how we set the VROC in Q1 that was actually set in Q3 of last year in a $100 price environment. So we probably had a ratable a little bit higher distribution in Q1. And then it gets more ratable as we go through Q2, Q3, and Q4 as we deliver the $11 billion that we've targeted for this year. And that's evidenced by how we set the VROC for Q3 at $0.60 a share.\n\nNeal Dingmann\n\nManaging Director of Energy Research, Truist Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Neal.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM. Your line is open.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, ROTH\n\nObviously strong results out of COP today. I think you enumerated a couple reasons for the Q1 production beat. Sounds like some wells came on early, and, well, results continue to be very strong, but just wanted to dive in a little bit on the maintenance side. I know you guys kind of talked about 35,000 BOE per day of maintenance, you know, in the quarter, that actually come to fruition, maybe that number was a little bit different. And then can talk about maintenance for the rest of the year? I see you had 10,000 to 15,000 expected in Q2, but any expectations for Q3 or Q4?\n\nDominic Macklon\n\nEVP of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology, ConocoPhillips\n\nYeah, thanks, Dominic. Here. So you're right. We did anticipate about 35,000 barrels a day of turnaround and maintenance impact in Q1. That actually came in at 25,000. So 10,000 lower. That was partly because of the efficiency that Nick talked about at the Lower 48. The Eagle Ford Sugarloaf stabilizer expansion went really well, and the team did a great job sheltering some of that. Then there was a little bit of timing there around Qatar turnarounds as well. So we had 25,000 barrels a day impact in Q1. We still expect a full year average impact from our turnarounds of about 15,000 barrels a day equivalent. Bill said Q2, I think, as you mentioned, expect to be 10 to 15.\nThere'll also be some standard sort of seasonal downtime in Q2 and Q3 we typically see in Norway, Alaska, and APLNG. All of that's reflected in our new guidance. 1.78 to 1.8MMbpd for the full year.\n\nLeo Mariani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, ROTH\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nPhil Gresh\n\nVP of Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Leo. We want to thank everyone for being here today. We appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today's call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nPhilip Gresh\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nYes. Thank you, operator, and welcome to everyone joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips' leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklon, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Global Operations; and Tim Leach, adviser to the CEO.\nRyan and Bill will kick off the call with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders: First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a presentation which you can find on our Investor Relations website.\nSecond, during this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings.\nFinally, to make -- we will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan M. Lance\n\nChairman & CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call.\nAs we sit here today, there are a number of cross-currents in the global economy. While the energy sector is not immune to potential macro headwinds, our fundamental outlook remains constructive. On the demand side, we think that growth will continue in 2023, aided by a normalization in China mobility following the loosening of COVID restrictions. On the supply side, we believe the continued producer discipline and the expected impacts of Russian oil and product sanctions are likely to keep balances tight. So while commodity prices are currently not as high as they averaged in 2022, we see duration to this up cycle.\nNow stepping back, we remain steadfast in our view that a successful energy transition must meet society's fundamental need for secure, reliable and affordable energy while also progressing toward a lower carbon future. While we all recognize the challenges that global energy policymakers face to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is clear that doing so requires an all-the-above approach. This can be done by enacting policies that encourage the development of lower-emission energy sources and oil and gas resources.\nThese policies should include efforts aimed at fiscal stability, streamlining of the permitting process, increased transparency on timelines and supporting critical infrastructure. These are not just necessary for the oil and gas industry, but also for nuclear, hydrogen and renewables, all of which will be necessary to deliver on the energy transition.\nAt the end of the day, it's critical for our administration to remember that North American energy production is a stabilizing force for both global energy security and meeting energy transition demand. Meeting that demand will require investments in medium- and long- cycle projects in addition to short-cycle U.S. shale. This is why you see ConocoPhillips leaning a bit further across our deep and diversified portfolio in 2023, whether it's the Lower 48, where we achieved record production in 2022, or our diversified global portfolio, ConocoPhillips is well positioned to meet the world's long-term energy needs while also reducing our own emissions footprint.\nShifting to our 2022 performance. ConocoPhillips showed continuous strong execution across our Triple Mandate. We generated a trailing 12-month return on capital employed of 27%, the highest since the spin. We delivered on our plan to return $15 billion of capital to our shareholders, which represented 53% of our CFO, well in excess of our greater than 30% annual through-the-cycle commitment, and we further advanced our net-zero operational emissions ambition with a new medium-term methane intensity target consistent with our recent commitment to joining OGMP 2.0.\nNow looking ahead, ConocoPhillips is well positioned to further deliver on our Triple Mandate in 2023 with a well-balanced capital allocation strategy. This morning, we announced a plan to return $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which represents about 50% of our forecasted CFO at $80 WTI.\nThe other half of our cash flow will be dedicated to reinvesting in the business. From a portfolio perspective, our deep and well-diversified asset base is well positioned to generate solid cash flow growth for decades to come. This is further evidenced by our organic reserve replacement ratio of 177% in 2022. We're also enthusiastic about our new LNG opportunities we are participating in, in Qatar and the United States, which are highly complementary to our existing LNG business. And we look forward to providing you a comprehensive update about our long-term strategy and our financial outlook at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Meeting on April 12 at the New York Stock Exchange.\nNow let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our fourth quarter performance and 2023 guidance in a bit more detail.\n\nWilliam L. Bullock\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. Starting with fourth quarter results. We generated $2.71 in adjusted earnings per share. Fourth quarter production was 1,758,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which included a 27,000 barrel a day negative impact from weather in the Lower 48. Lower 48 production averaged 997,000, including 671,000 from the Permian, 214,000 from the Eagle Ford and 96,000 from the Bakken.\nMoving to cash flow. Fourth quarter CFO was $6.5 billion excluding working capital at an average WTI price of $83 per barrel. APLNG distributions were $639 million and fourth quarter capital expenditures were $2.5 billion, including $2.1 billion of base capital and $300 million for acquisitions and North Field East payments.\nOn capital allocation, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through ordinary dividends, VROC payments and share buybacks while also reducing gross debt by $400 million. Full year CFO was $28.5 billion, excluding working capital at an average WTI price of $94 per barrel in 2022. Full year APLNG distributions were $2.2 billion and full year total CapEx was $10.2 billion with base CapEx achieving our guidance of $8.1 billion and $2.1 billion of acquisitions in North Field East payments. Full year return of capital was $15 billion, while $3.4 billion went to debt reduction with cash and short-term investments ending the year at $9.5 billion.\nTurning to 2023 guidance, we forecast full year production will be in a range of 1.76 million to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents 1% to 4% of organic growth. Our first quarter production guidance range is 1.72 million to 1.76 million, which includes $35,000 of planned maintenance, primarily in Qatar and the Lower 48. Our full year planned maintenance is expected to be similar to 2022.\nOn capital spending, we expect a range of $10.7 billion to $11.3 billion, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. We expect operating costs of $8.2 billion, DD&A of $8.1 billion and corporate segment net loss of $900 million.\nFor 2023 cash flow, we forecast $22 billion in CFO at $80 barrel WTI, $85 Brent and $3.25 Henry Hub at current strip prices for regional differentials. Included in our cash flow forecast is $1.9 billion in APLNG distributions with $600 million expected in the first quarter.\nNow regarding CapEx, we provide a waterfall in our prepared materials bridging 2022 actual spending to 2023 guidance. Starting with base capital spending, we forecast an increase from $8.1 billion in 2022 to a range of $9.1 billion to $9.3 billion in 2023. The remaining $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion is allocated to longer-term projects. Of this amount, $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion is for LNG projects, which includes Port Arthur, North Field East and North Field South. For Port Arthur specifically, after factoring in expected project financing, we forecast that ConocoPhillips net investment will be just under $2 billion over the 5-year investment period.\nHowever, more than half of this capital investment will be in 2023. For Willow, we're guiding to $100 million to $400 million of incremental spending with the higher end of this range, assuming that the project is sanctioned this year.\nIn summary, we're happy with our strong 2022 results, which would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our talented workforce. And we are well positioned to balance investing in our deep and diversified portfolio this year while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Phil.\n\nPhilip Gresh\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, ConocoPhillips\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. As a reminder, just before we go to the Q&A, we ask that you please keep it to one question and a follow-up. With that, Michelle, we're ready to turn it over to you for Q&A.",

My name is Richard, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to [Phil Gresh], Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nYes. Thank you, Richard, and welcome to everyone joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklon, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Global Operations; Jack Harper, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; and Tim Leach, adviser to the CEO. Ryan and Bill will kick off the call with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions.\nJust a few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a presentation which you can find on our Investor Relations website.

With that, I will turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan M. Lance\n\nChairman & CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Phil. Before I get into our strong results for the quarter, including record production, I'd like to touch on a few big-picture thoughts that are top of mind for us. First, inflation and supply chain constraints continue across the entire economy and our industry. This is particularly true in the U.S. shale, where rapidly escalating costs combined with extremely tight supply are limiting the pace of industry-wide production growth.\nSecond, we believe that the world is going to need investments in medium- and long-cycle production in addition to U.S. shale plays. The depth and quality of our U.S. unconventional inventory combined with our diverse global portfolio has us well positioned to meet these long-term supply challenges. And finally, a successful energy transition must meet society's fundamental need for secure, reliable and affordable energy while progressing to a lower carbon future.\nThis requires an all-of-the-above solution. Obstacles that prevent the global market from functioning properly are not going to help the American consumer and would be disastrous for our allies. Governments can help by enacting policies that encourage investments in developing lower-emission oil and gas resources that will be needed to get the world through to transition. This includes fiscal stability, streamlining permitting and supporting critical infrastructure for an all-of-the-above solution.\nNow against this backdrop, we believe that ConocoPhillips is well positioned to win in any environment. We remain committed to delivering on our triple mandate of responsibly and reliably meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and progressing towards achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition.\nAs further evidence of this commitment, our third quarter results demonstrated record total company production. Lower 48 production hit a milestone at over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we anticipate further growth in the fourth quarter. On returns, we generated a trailing 12-month ROCE of 27%. We increased our ordinary dividend by 11% to $0.51 per share, and we announced a $0.70 per-share VROC for the first quarter of 2023, and we increased our share buyback authorization by $20 billion.\nAdditionally, we'll return $15 billion of capital for 2022, which represents over 50% of our projected CFO, well in excess of our greater than 30% annual commitment. Now we believe that our CFO-based returns framework differentiates us relative to peers. And finally, our net zero operational emissions ambition, we recently announced a new medium-term methane intensity commitment consistent with our recent objectives of joining OGMP 2.0.\nFrom a strategic perspective, I want to provide an update on our global LNG initiatives. First, we were recently selected to participate in Qatar's North Field South project, following our selection earlier this year to participate in the North Field East, which adds to our long positive relationship with Qatar Energy.\nSecond, we agreed to terminal services for a 15-year period at the prospective Brunsbuettel LNG import terminal in Germany. And third, we continue to progress our Port Arthur LNG project with Sempra, which we expect to reach FID by early next year.\nNow overall, we continue to believe the substitution of natural gas in place of coal represents an opportunity for significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. This should drive global LNG demand and related opportunities well into the future.\nPutting this all together, we remain constructive on the outlook for the industry, and we have a deep portfolio of short-, medium- and longer-cycle low-cost supply assets that generate strong cash flow as we continue to deliver on our triple mandate. Now let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our overall performance for the quarter.\n\nWilliam L. Bullock\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, thanks, Ryan. From a financial standpoint, we had a solid third quarter. We generated $3.60 per share in adjusted earnings. Production was over 1,750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which included our previously guided approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impact from scheduled turnarounds as well as some impacts from the temporary force majeure in Libya in July. For the fourth quarter, we do not expect any material turnaround impacts.\nLower 48 production averaged a record 1,013,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 668,000 from the Permian, 224,000 from the Eagle Ford and 96,000 from the Bakken.\nCash provided from operating activities was $8.7 billion. Now this included a $15 billion benefit from working capital, primarily related to the timing of Norway tax payments and lower receivables. Excluding working capital, cash from operations was $7.2 billion. APLNG distributions were $257 million in the quarter, and we expect fourth quarter distributions to be about $600 million.\nOn capital, we invested $2.5 billion back into the business in the third quarter, including around $300 million for acquisitions. This resulted in free cash flow of $4.7 billion, which more than covered the $4.3 billion we returned to shareholders in the quarter. Factoring in $400 million of disposition proceeds, ending cash and short-term investments were $10.7 billion at September 30, up from $8.5 billion at June 30.\nTurning to guidance. We still expect full year production of 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day with a fourth quarter guidance range of 1.74 million to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. On costs, we've increased full year adjusted operating cost guidance to $7.7 billion from $7.5 billion, and this is driven by inflationary impacts. We have also increased full year organic CapEx to $8.1 billion from $7.8 billion, also driven by inflationary impacts and partner-operated working interests. Partially offsetting these increases, we have reduced full year DD&A guidance from $7.6 billion to $7.5 billion.\nIn terms of 2023 guidance, we anticipate providing full details with our fourth quarter earnings call in early February. We will also be hosting an Analyst and Investor Meeting next spring at the New York Stock Exchange, so please stay tuned for more details. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan M. Lance\n\nChairman & CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Bill. Now before we go to Q&A, I wanted to spend a minute discussing a few important organizational announcements. First, Jack Harper, our EVP of the Lower 48, informed me that he will be leaving the company due to a family medical situation. And I know I speak on behalf of the entire organization when I say that Jack will be greatly missed.\nNow in conjunction with this announcement, Nick Olds, currently our Executive Vice President of Global Operations, will become the Executive Vice President, Lower 48; and Andy O'Brien, currently our Vice President and Treasurer, will become Senior Vice President, Global Operations and join the executive leadership team. Now with that, I'd be -- I wanted to turn the call over to Jack and give him the opportunity to say a few thoughts.\n\nJack F. Harper\n\nEVP of Lower 48, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. As Ryan mentioned, I will be leaving ConocoPhillips due to a family medical situation. It has truly been a privilege to work for both Concho and ConocoPhillips over the past 16.5 years. When Concho agreed to the merger with ConocoPhillips, we did so because we believed that the transaction would create a uniquely strong and differentiated company, and I cannot feel better about how this has played out.\nThis may be one of the most dynamic times that we've ever seen in the industry. And my competitive side certainly makes me wish that I could stay on board for what is ahead. However, I'm confident that we have set up the team for success with our organizational structure and planned transition over the next few months. With that, let me turn the call back over to Ryan.\n\nRyan M. Lance\n\nChairman & CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Jack. And I know I speak for everybody at ConocoPhillips. We have you and your family in all our prayers. So with that, let me turn it back over to Phil, and we'll get going with the Q&A.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ryan. (Operator Instructions) And with that, Richard, we'll turn it back to you.",

My name is Richard, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mark Keener, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Keener, you may begin.\n\nMark Keener\n\nVP of IR, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Richard, and welcome to everyone joining us for our second-quarter earnings call. First, let me introduce the members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team taking part in today's call. We have Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklon, EVP of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology; Nick Olds, EVP of Global Operations; Jack Harper, EVP of Lower 48; and Tim Leach, Adviser to the CEO.\nOn the call, Ryan and Bill will provide some opening comments, after which the team is available to take your questions.\nBefore I turn it over to them, just a few quick reminders. In conjunction with this morning's press release, we posted supplemental materials that include second-quarter earnings results and highlights, earnings and cash flow summaries, price realizations and sensitivities for estimating earnings and cash flow, and updated guidance for the third quarter and full year. During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Of course, actual results may differ due to the factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings.\nAnd finally, we'll make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's release and on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman & CEO, ConocoPhillips Company\n\nWell, thank you, Mark. And for those -- Mark has elected to retire. So I want to start off by really thanking him for more than 30 years of dedicated service to our company and wish him well in retirement.\nAnd at the same time, I'd like to warmly welcome Phil Gresh, who will be joining our team next month as Vice President of Investor Relations.\nNow before I get into the results for the quarter, I'd also like to touch on a few things that continue to be top of mind for us. The ongoing tragic invasion in Ukraine and the residual implications from COVID have significantly impacted supply chains around the world, with shock waves driving both product shortages and elevated levels of volatility, including large swings in commodity prices. The combination of these factors has brought into sharp focus the critical importance of U.S. and global energy security and reliability.\nBy fulfilling our Triple Mandate of responsibly and reliably meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and progressing toward achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition, we're playing a key role in providing secure, dependable energy solutions that are clearly needed around the globe.\nThe guiding principles of our Triple Mandate were key to our recent actions and announcements regarding global LNG supply capacity, as the use of natural gas in place of coal and refined products represents an opportunity for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We believe this reality is going to drive increasingly strong global LNG demand and related opportunities well into the future.\nAs recently announced, we entered into an HOA with Sempra for a possible investment in the Port Arthur LNG project that's currently underway. The potential investment is designed to leverage our company's considerable strength as one of the largest gas producers and marketers in North America, while expanding our global LNG business. This potential investment is expected to be project financed and, if executed, would afford us the opportunity to participate in additional strategically located LNG projects as well as to jointly pursue related emissions reduction opportunities.\nThat announcement followed our recently completed 10% ownership increase in APLNG, as well as our selection to participate in Qatar's North Field East project, adding to our long, positive relationship with QatarEnergy. Our recent decision to join the OGMP 2.0 initiative is also in service to achieving our Triple Mandate, as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane is an imperative for our company and our sector. Applying the rigorous OGMP 2.0 reporting standard, which incorporates third-party verification, will be a vital step on our path to net-zero operational emissions.\nNow before I turn the call over to Bill to cover the second-quarter performance, let's discuss for a moment on the equally important returns element of our Triple Mandate. Looking at, first, at returns on capital, we generated a trailing 12-month ROCE of 24% in the quarter, five points higher than the 19% we delivered last quarter.\nTurning next to our returns of capital. Once again, we've increased our targeted 2022 distributions to shareholders, taking the total full-year expected returns to $15 billion. This represents a 50% increase from the target announced last quarter with the $15 billion to be distributed across our three tiers of ordinary dividends, share repurchases and VROC. At current strip prices, this represents a return to shareholders of slightly more than 50% of our projected CFO for the year.\nOur commitment to achieving our Triple Mandate is unwavering, and delivering competitive returns on and of capital to our shareholders through the cycles is a key component of that commitment.\nNow let me turn it over to Bill to cover our overall performance for the quarter.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nWell, thanks, Ryan. And as you noted, we generated a return on capital employed of 24% on a trailing 12-month basis. On a cash-adjusted basis, that improves to 27%.\nTurning to earnings per share, we generated $3.91 per share in adjusted earnings in the quarter. This was driven by strong realized prices and production of almost 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. As we previously mentioned, production volumes in the second quarter were reduced by scheduled turnarounds as well as some unplanned weather and other minor impacts.\nLower 48 production averaged 977,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, including 634,000 from the Permian, 233,000 from Eagle Ford and 91,000 from the Bakken. Operations across the rest of our global portfolio also ran well, leading us to generate $7.8 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, excluding working capital. This includes roughly $750 million in distributions from APLNG, and we continue to project full-year distributions of $2.3 billion, with roughly $300 million expected in the third quarter.\nWe also invested $2 billion back into the business in the second quarter, resulting in free cash flow of $5.9 billion. That more than covered the total $3.3 billion we returned to shareholders in the quarter, as well as the $1.9 billion used to reduce total debt. These actions, taken in combination with the $600 million in disposition proceeds and the purchase of approximately $300 million in long-term investments, resulted in ending cash back of $8.5 billion as of June 30.\nTurning to the second half, we provided a third-quarter production guidance range of 1.7-to-1.76 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and reduced our full-year production from 1.76 million to 1.74 million per day. That's primarily related to risking of projected production from Libya in the second half of the year, as well as some modest updates across the portfolio.\nNow in conjunction with these changes, we reduced DD&A guidance from $7.7 billion to $7.6 billion for the year. We also increased full-year 2022 adjusted operating cost guidance to $7.5 billion from the prior $7.3 billion. Now this is reflecting commodity-related price impacts.\nWe reduced guidance for the corporate-segment loss from $1 billion to $900 million, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from our recent debt reduction and higher interest earned on cash balances, along with some restructuring efforts. Operating capital guidance for the year remains unchanged at $7.8 billion.\nSo to sum it up, we have delivered another strong quarter across all aspects of our Triple Mandate. Our diverse global asset portfolio continues to run well. We returned $3.3 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter, ended the quarter with $8.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and increased our full-year return-of-capital target to $15 billion. We continued to strengthen our fortress balance sheet, and we have reduced total debt by $3 billion year-to-date. And we further enhanced our low-cost energy transition-oriented portfolio by expanding our current and future presence in the growing global LNG market and by joining the OGMP 2.0 initiative.\nNow with that, let's go to Q&A.",

Of course, actual results may differ due to the factors described in today's release and our periodic SEC filings. And finally, we'll also make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's release and on our website.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Lance\n\nChairman & CEO, ConocoPhillips Company\n\nThank you, Mark. Before we get into the results for the quarter, I'd like to touch on a couple of other items that are top of mind for us. The first is the war in Ukraine. In a world already ravaged by the pandemic, this unprovoked invasion is having tragic consequences as we all see in heartbreaking detail in the news every day. The bravery of the Ukrainian people is inspiring, and we pray for a peaceful resolution at the earliest possible moment.\nThis deeply troubling war is also disrupting supply chains at a time of recovering global economic growth and energy demand. It is affecting every aspect of the global economy and impacting the energy security of our allies in Europe, and it's driving significant volatility in commodity prices. We are fortunate that the United States has abundant resources to ensure our own energy security. These resources also provide vital geopolitical benefits. Secure U.S. energy exports serve as a market-stabilizing factor, enabling our allies to better withstand energy blackmail by hostile and unreliable sources.\nLike the rest of industry, we've quickly restored activity levels from the lows driven by the pandemic-related energy price collapse despite lingering service and supply chain shortages, infrastructure permitting delays and lag time required for workforce and equipment redeployment. As a result, total U.S. oil and gas production is growing meaningfully despite these headwinds. And ConocoPhillips will continue to do our part as we fulfill our triple mandate of reliably and responsibly meeting energy transition demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and achieving our net-zero ambition.\nNow the other topic I'd like to touch on are the leadership changes we announced a couple of days ago. I suspect you all saw the release on Monday, but for those who might have missed it, Tim will be transitioning from leading our Lower 48 business, which he's done incredibly well since we combined companies a little over a year ago, to serving in an advisory role to myself and the entire leadership team. Tim has truly been an industry visionary, founding Concho almost 20 years ago, and growing it into one of the Permian's largest and best-run companies before joining ConocoPhillips. He's also been instrumental in driving value realization as we've integrated the assets into the company. I'm appreciative that we'll continue to benefit from Tim's significant experience and strategic relationships in his new capacity and of course, as a member of our Board.\nI'm also very pleased to welcome Jack Harper, who most of you know, to our leadership team as executive vice president of our Lower 48 business. Jack is an experienced, proven leader who will help ensure that our Lower 48 business fulfills its key role in delivering on our Triple Mandate.\nReflecting now on the quarter, once again, we've made significant progress working on all levers across the company. We efficiently and safely delivered our capital scope globally and successfully integrated the Shell Permian assets. We also took important steps to further strengthen our balance sheet, and continue to upgrade our portfolio with the sale of our mature Indonesian business and the acquisition of an additional 10% stake in our long-life, high-quality APLNG business. We're running well and with very strong financial performance.\nNow building on two very successful Permian transactions, we have truly transformed ConocoPhillips. We're a premier E&P company with a large low cost of supply, low-GHG-intensity resource base, returns-focused strategy and the balance sheet strength to thrive through the price cycles of the evolving energy transition. And underscoring this last point, we also recently published our Plan for our Net-Zero Energy Transition, which is available on our website.\nI'm going to let Bill cover the first-quarter results. But before turning the call over to him, on the topic of returns, I want to highlight the fact that for the second consecutive quarter, we've again increased our targeted 2022 shareholder distributions, this time with an incremental $2 billion or a 25% increase, to be distributed through the blend of share repurchases and additional variable cash returns. We continue to make significant strides in all elements of our triple mandate. And as you know, we have now a five-plus year track record of returning well over 30% of our CFO to our shareholders. The increased $10 billion target for 2022 further demonstrates our commitment to return significant value to investors through the price cycles.\nSo now let me turn the call over to Bill, and he'll cover the results for the quarter, starting with our returns on capital.\n\nBill Bullock\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nPicking up where Ryan left off, we generated a return on capital employed of 19% on a trailing-12-month basis. That's 21% on a cash-adjusted basis. We understand and appreciate that returns on and of capital matter to our investors, and we are fully focused on delivering to our shareholders.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we generated $3.27 per share in adjusted earnings. That's driven by strong realized prices and production of 1,747,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a record level of production since we became an independent E&P 10 years ago. And it's bolstered by our two highly accretive Permian acquisitions over the past 18 months. Lower 48 production averaged 967,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, including 640,000 from the Permian, 208,000 from Eagle Ford and 97,000 from the Bakken.\nOperations across the rest of our global portfolio also ran well, allowing us to generate $7 billion in cash from operations, excluding working capital in the quarter. We also continue to enhance our low cost of supply, low-greenhouse-gas-intensity portfolio, closing on both the sale of our Indonesian assets and the acquisition of an additional 10% of APLNG, taking ownership there to 47.5%. Both of these transactions enhance our overall margins going forward.\nIllustrating this point, we realized roughly $500 million in cash distributions from APLNG in the first quarter, and we've already received $400 million so far in the second quarter. While the full-year distributions will continue to depend on prices going forward, if you assume Brent averages $100 per barrel for the year, we would expect roughly $2.3 billion of total distributions from APLNG in 2022.\nTurning back to focus on the first quarter, in addition to the $7 billion in CFO, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from the sale of our remaining 93 million shares of Cenovus. And this $1.4 billion fully refunded the shares repurchased here of our $2.3 billion total returns to shareholders in the quarter. We also made significant strides toward our $5 billion debt-reduction target, executing a successful refinancing through which we reduced our total debt by $1.2 billion. We decreased our annual interest expense by about $100 million and extended our overall debt maturity by three years.\nAlso, in April we called our $1.3 billion note, which was due in 2026. So we'll have achieved approximately half of our $5 billion debt reduction target by the end of May. And with the progress we've made in the first two quarters of this year and our remaining natural maturities, we'll reduce our debt by $3.3 billion this year. We are now positioned to meet our overall $5 billion reduction target in 2025. That's one year earlier than our prior projections.\nAs you will have noted, we also invested roughly $1.8 billion back into the business in the first quarter of the year. While this is ratable with the $7.2 billion full-year capital estimate we provided last December, we're increasing our guidance to $7.8 billion. About half of the increase is due to additional low cost of supply drilling and completion activity in some of our partner-operated areas in the Lower 48. And the rest is modestly higher inflation, as we believe the supply chain constraints will be prolonged as a result of the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine.\nFrom a production standpoint, we've adjusted our full-year target from an approximate 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day to roughly 1.76 million per day. That's reflecting the net impact of closed A&D activity through this point in the year, as well as some expected impacts from weather and well timing.\nSo we've had a strong quarter to open the year. We've returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders and ended the quarter with $7.5 billion of cash and short-term investments. We further enhanced our low-cost of supply portfolio, and we strengthened our balance sheet. And of course, our operations around the globe are well-positioned to deliver on our commitments through the rest of this year and through the energy transition that's ahead of us.\nWith that, let's go to Q&A.",

My name is [Zanera], and I'll be the operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Keener, VP, Investor Relations. Mark, you may begin.\n\nMark Keener\n\nThank you, Zanera. Welcome to all of our listeners today. First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on today's call. We have Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklon, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology; Tim Leach, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; and Nick Olds, Executive Vice President for Global Operations. Brian and Bill will lead off today's call with some prepared comments, after which the team will be available to take your questions.\nBefore I turn the call over to Ryan, a few quick reminders. In conjunction with this morning's release, we posted supplemental materials that include fourth quarter and full year 2021 highlights, earnings and cash flow summaries, preliminary reserve replacement information, price realization analysis and updated 2022 guidance and sensitivities.\nDuring our call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ due to the factors described in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. And finally, we'll also make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's release and on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan M. Lance\n\nChairman & CEO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThank you, Mark. So 2021 was a truly remarkable year for ConocoPhillips. Our operating performance around the globe was outstanding, we generated strong returns on and of capital for our shareholders and closed on 2 significant highly accretive acquisitions in the heart of the Permian Basin. Our exceptional results last year are directly attributable to the talent and dedication of our global workforce.\nWe produced 1.6 million barrels per day and brought first production online at GMT2 in Alaska, the third Montney well pad and the Malikai Phase II and S&P Phase 2 projects in Malaysia. We also completed the Tor II project in Norway and achieved all of this with excellent cost, schedule, safety and environmental performance.\nFinancially, we achieved a 14% full year return on capital employed or 16% on a cash adjusted basis and generated $15.7 billion in CFO, with over $10 billion in free cash flow. And we returned $6 billion to our shareholders, representing 38% of our cash from operations. We also continued our rigorous portfolio optimization work, completing the truly transformative Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions and further high-grading our asset base around the world.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, we exercised our preemption right to acquire an additional 10% in APLNG and announced the sale of assets in Indonesia for $1.4 billion. In the Lower 48, we generated $0.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of noncore assets last year and last week, we signed an agreement to sell an additional property set, outside of our core areas for an additional $440 million. Collectively, these transactions reduced both the average cost of supply and the GHG intensity of our more than [20 billion-barrel] resource base and we're well down the road towards achieving our [4 billion to 5 billion] in dispositions by 2023.\nIn early December, consistent with our 10-year plan and capital allocation priorities, we announced a returns-driven capital budget for 2022 that's expected to deliver modest growth this year. We also introduced a new variable return of cash or VROC, tiered to our distribution framework and provided a full year target of $7 billion in total returns of capital to our shareholders. Based on current prices on the forward curve, we've increased the target to $8 billion, with the incremental $1 billion coming in the form of increased share repurchases and a higher variable return of cash. The $0.30 per share VROC announced for the second quarter represents a 50% increase over our inaugural variable returned to shareholders that we paid this quarter.\nNow to put the $8 billion in perspective, it equates to an increase of more than 30% from the $6 billion returned last year and a greater than 50% increase in projected cash return to shareholders. Our 3-tier distribution framework provides a flexible and durable means to meet our returns commitment through the price cycle and truly is differential to others in this sector as our returns commitment is based on a percentage of CFO and not free cash flow.\nAnd as you know, we are guided in everything we do by our triple mandate. We must reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand. We need to generate competitive returns on and of capital for our shareholders and achieve our Paris-aligned net zero ambition by 2050. Just as I'm very proud of the excellent operational and returns-focused performance we delivered in 2021, I'm equally pleased about the progress we have made in support of the third pillar of our mandate. We increased our medium-term emissions intensity reduction target to 40% to 50% by 2030 and expanded it to include both gross operated and net equity production.\nAs a reminder, we're also committed to further reducing our methane emissions and achieving our 0 routine flaring ambition by 2025. And as highlighted in our December release, we've allocated $0.2 billion of this year's capital program for projects to reduce the company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investments in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions. We strongly believe that this level of focus on and performance toward fully realizing our triple mandate has ConocoPhillips very well positioned to not just survive through the energy transition, but to thrive regardless of the pathways it takes.\nWhile we're on the topic of energy transition, I'd like to touch on the macroenvironment. Commodity prices today reflect global energy demand returning to pre-pandemic levels, along with supply being impacted by decreased investment in oil and gas over the past couple of years, concerns about inventory levels, and the amount of available spare production capacity in the system. All these factors demonstrate the ongoing importance of our sector to the global economy today and for the foreseeable future.\nIt's becoming increasingly clear that the energy transition isn't going to happen with the flip of a switch. What people and businesses around the globe need is a managed and orderly transition, but that's not what the world is seeing to this point. Supply and demand balances are fragile at the moment, likely driving continued volatility and the current commodity price situation in Europe may be providing a cautionary signal. The simple reality is that most alternative energy sources still have a long way to go towards becoming as scalable, reliable, affordable and accessible as the world needs them to be, which brings me back to our triple mandate and the importance of performing well across all 3 of the pillars, for our shareholders and for the people in the world who need and use our products.\nNow with that, let me turn the call over to Bill, and he will cover the fourth quarter and our 2022 outlook.\n\nWilliam L. Bullock\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, ConocoPhillips\n\nThanks, Ryan. Looking at fourth quarter earnings, we generated $2.27 per share in adjusted earnings. This performance reflects production above the midpoint of guidance and strong price realizations as well as some commercial and inventory timing benefits, partially offset by slightly higher costs in DD&A. Lower 48 production averaged 818,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, including 483,000 from the Permian, 213,000 from the Eagle Ford and 100,000 from the Bakken. As previously communicated, our Permian and overall Lower 48 production were both increased roughly 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter due to the conversion from 2 to 3 stream accounting for the acquired Concho assets.\nAt the end of the year, we had 20 operated drilling rigs and 9 frac crews working in the Lower 48, including those developing the acreage we recently acquired from Shell. As Ryan touched on earlier, operations across the rest of the portfolio also ran extremely well last year with our GMT2 project in Alaska producing first oil in the fourth quarter as planned.\nTurning to cash from operations, we generated $5.5 billion in CFO, excluding working capital, resulting in free cash flow of $3.9 billion in the quarter. For the full year 2021, we generated $15.7 billion in CFO, $10.4 billion of free cash flow and returned $6 billion to shareholders. In addition to the asset dispositions Ryan covered, we also sold 117 million shares we held in Synovis in the year, generating $1.1 billion in proceeds that we used to fund repurchases of our own shares. This left us with a little over 90 million Synovis shares at the end of the year, which we intend to fully monetize by the end of this quarter.\nWe ended the year with over $5 billion in cash, maintaining our differential balance sheet strength, even after completing the all-cash acquisition of Shell's Delaware Basin assets. So to recap, it was not only a strong quarter but one that also bodes very well for 2022 and future years. We continue to optimize the portfolio, our businesses are running very well around the globe, and we have had an overall reserve replacement ratio of nearly 380%, establishing an incredibly powerful platform for the company as we head into this year and beyond.\nOur cash flow performance and leverage to prices have substantially improved over the past couple of years as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results and expect it will continue to improve as we begin including the newly-acquired Delaware assets in our consolidated results this quarter. Now demonstrating this point and appreciating that it's helpful for the market to have an accurate sense of our stronger CFO generating capacity, at a WTI price of $75 a barrel with a $3 differential to Brent and a Henry Hub price of $3.75, we estimate our 2022 full year cash from operations would be approximately $21 billion, which reflects us reentering a tax-paying position in the U.S. this year at those price levels. And our free cash flow for the year would be roughly $14 billion.\nAnd of course, we continue to be unhedged across our global diverse production base, so we expect to fully capture the upside of the current price environment. We provided updated sensitivities in today's supplemental materials to help estimate how much earnings and CFO are projected to change this year with market price movements.\nSo to sum it up, all that we've shared with you today underscores our readiness to reliably generate very competitive returns for our shareholders. as we thoughtfully move forward as a responsible, valuable E&P player in the energy transition. That is our triple mandate. It's what we have ConocoPhillips built for and are ready to deliver.\nNow with that, let's go to the operator to start the Q&A",

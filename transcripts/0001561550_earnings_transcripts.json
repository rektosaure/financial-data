Welcome to the Third Quarter 2025 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nThank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's third quarter 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2025 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities and our ability to capitalize on market opportunities. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank all of you for joining us this morning to go through our results for Q3. Let me begin with this quarter's business drivers. We have seen broad-based positive trends in the demand environment with an ongoing strength of cloud migration and digital transformation. Against this backdrop, we executed a very strong Q3 both in new bookings and usage growth of existing customers.\nAs a notable inflection, we saw acceleration of year-over-year revenue growth across our non AI customers. And the sequential usage growth for non-AI existing customers was the highest we have seen going back 2 quarters. This growth was broad-based as our customers are adopting more products and getting more value from the Datadog platform.\nWe also experienced strong revenue growth for our AI native customers and a broadening contribution to growth among those customers. There, too, we saw an acceleration of growth in our AI cohort in Q3 when excluding our largest customer.\nLooking at new business. Contribution from new customers increased in Q3 in both the amount of new customer bookings as well as the revenue contribution from new customers. And as usual, churn has remained low with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\nRegarding our Q3 financial performance and key metrics. Revenue was $886 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended Q3 with about 32,000 customers up from about 29,200 a year ago. We also ended with about 4,060 customers with an ARR of $100,000 more, up from about 3,490 a year ago. These customers generated about 89% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $214 million with a free cash flow margin of 24%.\nTurning to customer adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q3, 84% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 83% a year ago. 54% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 49% a year ago. 31% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 26% a year ago and 16% of our customers were using 8 or products from 12% a year ago.\nDigital experience is an example of an area with our platform where our rapid piece of innovation is turning into tangible value for our customers. Our digital experience products include RUM or Real User Monitoring, to observe and improve application beginning figure here in mobile products. Synthetic, to user flows and proactively detect user facing issues and product analytics to help users connect application behavior to business impact.\nOver the years, we built our product breadth and depth in this area, and that is being recognized in the marketplace. For the second year in a row, Datadog has been named the leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for digital experience monitoring. We are pleased that today give digital experience products together exceed $300 million in ARR. And this includes, in particular, a very fast ramp for Product Analytics which has already seen adoption by more than 1,000 customers. We also want to call out our security suite of products where we are executing and accelerating growth.\nSecurity ARR growth was in the mid-50s as a percentage year-over-year in Q3, up from the mid-40s we mentioned last quarter. We're starting to see success in including Cloud SIEM in larger deals, and we'll get back to that in a bit in our customer examples. And we're seeing positive trends beyond Cloud SIEM, including fast uptake of good security and an increasing number of wins in cloud security. Overall, we saw year-over-year growth acceleration in each one of our security products.\nMoving on to R&D. We continue to deliver on what is a very ambitious AI road map. We are seeing high customer interest in our Bits AI agents, which we announced at our DASH conference in June. We have now onboarded thousands of customers for access, the Bits AI SRE agent. And as we prepare for general availability, we are getting very enthusiastic feedback on the time and cost savings enabled by Bits AI.\nAs RUM user recently told us, with Bits AI SRE being on call 24/7 for us, meantime resolution for our services has improved significantly. For most cases, the investigation is already taken care of well before our engineers sit down and open their laptops to assess the issue. And this is not an isolated comment. We see the potential here for our agents who radically transform observability and operations.\nIn LLM Observability, we recently launched LLM experiments and playgrounds for general availability, helping teams to rapidly iterate on LLM applications and AI agents. We also launched custom LLM as George evaluations for general availability, which lets customers write evaluation prompts to access application quality and safety.\nAs an illustration of both and adoption in the past month, the number of LLM spans customers attending Datadog has more than quadrupled. And we are seeing a lot of interest in the Datadog MCP servers. Our MCP server acts as a bridge between Datadog and AI agents, such as Codex, OpenAI, Claude Anthropic, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, [indiscernible] and many more.\nOur previous customers are using real-time production data as a context to drive trouble shooting, with [indiscernible] and automation agents. One user told us, the Datadog MCP server is a great tool. You can now to get the last slide is my app and follow the spas and trace all the way to the goods have never been more hooked on Datadog. So we see MCP adoption as a great way to cement Datadog even further into our customers' workflows.\nFinally, we continue to see rising customer interest for next-gen AI observability with over 5,000 customers setting AI data to one or more of AI integrations. On the topic of integrations, we are very proud to now support over 1,000 integrations, which we believe is unparalleled in our space. By using our integration, customer called otherwise disparate data sources across editor products for deeper analysis. We can see from a customer's usage that this is a critical part of the Datadog platform. Our 32,000 customers use more than 50 integration average, while customers spending over $1 million annually with us use more than 150.\nAnd most importantly, as tech stack evolves, we continue to update and expand our integrations. So our customers can use that Datadog to deploy new technologies with confidence. Last but not least, I wanted to give a shout out to our AI research team for the amazing work they have published. Our [indiscernible] model has been one of the top down lows and hedging space over the past few months, and that is across all categories. It is very impactful as mandate think, the high quality of this work allows us to attract world-class AI researchers and engineers.\nNow let's move on to sales and marketing. We had a number of great new logo wins in customer expansion this quarter. So I'll go through a few of them. First, we need a 7-figure annualized deal with a leading European telco, our largest ever land deal in Europe. This company's previous setup was expensive in efficient and wasn't scaling to meet their needs. By using Datadog, they expect to save over $1 million annually on tool cost alone, along with millions of dollars more in reduce operation costs, lower engineering time and avoidance of the new loss. They will adopt 11 Datadog products to start, and we consolidate more than 10 commercial tools.\nNext, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a leading financial risk and analytics company. The company's fragmented tooling has led to major incidents that sometimes took multiple days and hundreds of engineers to resolve. They plan to start with 11 Datadog products including OnCall, Clouds and Bits AI, will replace 14 commercial open source and hyperscale observability tools.\nNext, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a Fortune 500 technology hardware company. This is an exciting win for new -- sorry. This is an exciting win for our new go-to-market motions, targeting the largest and most sophisticated companies in the world. Datadog has been chosen as their strategy observability partner, and we are displacing commercial tools across availability, cloud team and incident response. This customer is starting with 14 Datadog products.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 500 financial services company. This customer has pockets of silo term data, including 1 business unit, which minorly hosted and maintained 93 separate instances of open source tooling. With this expansion, this company will add up 15 Datadog products, including all 3 pillars in all of their business units. They will also replace their SIEM solution with Datadog Cloud SIEM in a 7-figure land deal for Cloud SIEM. And by bringing all their telemetry data into the Datadog platform, they expect better insights for their adoption of Bits AI agent today with Bits AI [indiscernible].\nNext, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 500 heavy equipment company. With this expansion, this customer will replace its open source log solution with Datadog log management and Flex Logs. They plan to adopt LLM Observability and their IT team is using cloud cost management to improve cost visibility and governance.\nNext, we will come back a leading vertical SaaS company who is a 7-figure analyze deal. By returning to Datadog this customer benefits more alignment with open telemetry and we'll implement the incident and reliability processes that they were able to execute on previously.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a major American carmaker. This customer developing Datadog products faster than previously expected and segment support higher usage. With this expansion, they will adopt Datadog incident management and OnCall solution company-wide for a total of 5,000 users who support operational continuity across the business.\nFinally, we signed a 9-figure annualized expansion with a leading AI company. This company has been a long-time Datadog customer and has expanded their usage of multiple products, securing better economics for a higher commitment with an early renewal. Speaking of AI customers, we continue to help native customers big and small to grow and scale their businesses. And we continue to see this group broadly in number and size with more than 500 AI companies in this group, but 100 of which are spending more than $100,000 annually with Datadog and more than 15 who are spending more than $1 million annually with us.\nWhile we know there's a lot of attention on this cohort, we primarily see it as an indication of what's to come as companies of every size and every single industry incorporate AI into their clarifications. And that's it for another very strong quarter from our go-to-market teams, who ran our very hard at work as we have a really exciting pipeline for Q4.\nBefore I turn it over to David for a financial review, I want to say a few words on our longer-term market. There is no change to our overall view that digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business. Meanwhile, we are advancing rapidly in AI, where we are incredibly excited about our opportunities. We're building a comprehensive set of AI Observability products to help our customers tackle the higher complexity of the com with the technologies. And we are building AI into Datadog, and I spoke earlier about the excitement our customers have for our Bits AI agents.\nThe market opportunity in cloud and AI is expected to grow rapidly into the trillions of dollars and companies of every size and industry are looking to adopt AI to deliver value to their customers and drive positive business outcome. So we're moving fast to help our customers develop, deploy and grow into the cloud and into the AI world.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. To start, our Q3 revenue was $886 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q3 revenue growth. First, overall, we saw sequential usage growth from existing customers in Q3 that was higher than our expectations and the strongest in 12 quarters in our non-AI native customer base.\nWe saw year-over-year growth acceleration broadly across our business, including in new logos and existing customers, both enterprise and SMB with customers across our spending bands, big and small, and customers in a wide variety of industries.\nNext, we saw strong and accelerating contribution from new customers. New logo annualized bookings more than doubled year-over-year and set a new record driven by an increase in average new logo land size, particularly in enterprise. We believe we are starting to see the benefits of our growth of sales capacity. And we are seeing new logos ramping faster, contributing more to revenue growth. The portion of our year-over-year revenue growth that related to new customers was about 25% in Q3, up from 20% in Q2.\nNext, our AI native customers continue to exhibit rapid growth, while more customers in this group are growing to be sizable customers. As Olivier discussed, we extended the contract of our largest AI native customer. In addition, we now have more larger AI customers, including 15 of them spending $1 million or more annually with Datadog, and about 100 spending more than $100,000 annually. Year-over-year revenue growth from our AI native customers, excluding the largest customer, again, accelerated in Q3.\nIn Q3, this group represented 12% of our revenue, up from 11% last quarter and about 6% in the year ago quarter. I will note that over time, we think this metric will become less relevant as AI usage in production broadens beyond this group of customers. Our year-over-year revenue growth also accelerated amongst our non-AI native customers.\nIn Q3, our revenue growth, excluding AI native customer group, was 20% year-over-year, accelerating from 18% year-over-year in Q2, and we have seen this trend of accelerating growth continue in October. Regarding retention metrics. Our trailing 12-month net revenue retention percentage was 120% similar to last quarter and our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remain in the mid- to high 90s.\nAnd now moving on to our financial results. Our billings were $893 million, up 30% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO and was $2.79 billion, up 53% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the low 50s percentage year-over-year. Our strong bookings contributed to this acceleration of RPO. We continue to believe that revenue is a better indication of our trends in our business and billings and RPO.\nAnd now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $719 million, and our gross margin was 81.2%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.9% last quarter and 81.1% in the year ago quarter. As previously mentioned, we continue to see the impact of our engineers cost-saving efforts in Q3 as they deliver on our cloud efficiency projects.\nOur Q3 OpEx grew 30% -- 32% excuse me, year-over-year, down from 36% last quarter. We continue to grow our investments to pursue our long-term growth opportunities, and this OpEx growth is an indication of our execution on our hiring plan. Q3 operating income was $207 million for a 23% operating margin compared to 20% last quarter and 25% in the year ago quarter.\nAnd now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash flow from operations was $251 billion in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $214 million for a free cash flow margin of 24%.\nAnd now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2025. First, our guidance velocity overall remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and imply conservatism on these growth trends. So for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $912 million to $916 million, which represents a 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $216 million to $220 million, which implies an operating margin of 24%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56 per share based on approximately 367 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year -- fiscal year 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $3.386 billion to $3.390 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth.\nNon-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $754 million to $758 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.02 per share, based on 364 million weighted average diluted shares. And finally, some additional notes on our guidance. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2025 to be approximately $170 million. We continue to expect cash taxes in 2025 to be about $10 million to $20 million and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 and going forward. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 4% of revenues in fiscal year 2025.\nTo summarize, we are pleased with our execution in Q3. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, including their adoption of AI. And I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts.\nAnd with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

Welcome to the Q2 2025 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yuka Broderick, SVP of Investor Relations.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nThank you, DD. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's second quarter 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning.\nJoining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025 and related notes and assumptions our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities and our ability to capitalize on market opportunities.\nThe words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website along with a replay of this call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial [indiscernible] in our earnings release. which is available at investors.datadog.hq.com.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning to go through our results for Q2. Let me begin with this quarter's business drivers.\nOverall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing customers in Q2 that were higher than our expectations. We experienced strong growth in our AI native cohort. The number of AI native customers are growing meaningfully with us as they see rapid user growth with their products.\nMeanwhile, we saw consistent and steady usage growth in the rest of the business. We continue to see the overall demand environment as solid with an ongoing healthy pace of cloud migration and digital transformation. And churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\nRegarding our Q2 financial performance and key metrics, revenue was $827 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended Q2 with about 31,400 customers, up from about 28,700 a year ago. This includes about 150 new customers from our Eppo and Metaplane acquisitions.\nWe ended Q2 with about 3,850 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 3,390 a year ago. And this customers generated about 89% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $165 million with a free cash flow margin of 20%.\nTurning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q2, 83% of customers were using 2 or more products, the same as last year. 52% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 49% a year ago. 29% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 25% a year ago and 14% of our customers were using 8 or more products, up from 11% a year ago.\nSo our customers continue to add up more products, including our security offerings. As a reminder, our security customers can identify management vulnerabilities with code security, cloud security and sensitive data scanner and they can detect and protect from attacks with app and API protection, protection and\nWe are pleased that our security suite of products now generate over $100 million in ARR and is growing mid-40% year-over-year. While we are pleased to achieve this milestone, we are still just getting started in solving customer products in this area with new innovations such as AI security\nMoving on to R&D. We held our DASH User Conference in June, where we announced over 125 exciting new products and features for our users. So let's go through some of the announcements.\nFirst, we launched fully autonomous AI agents. including Bits AI SRE agent to investigate alerts and coordinated response. Bits AI data agent, an AI-powered coding assistant to proactively fix production issues. And Bits AI security analyst to cloud SIM signals.\nTo further accelerate our users incident response, we announced AI voice agent for incident response so users can quickly get up to speed and start taking action on their phones. We also announced hand-off notifications that make it easy to jump straight into the relevant context and quickly communicate with our responders. And status pages to enable automatic updates for customers and\nSecond, we delivered a series of products to help customers ship better software with confidence. With a Datadog internal developer portal, developers can ship better and faster by gaining a real-time view into their software systems and APIs with the subject catalog by provisioning infrastructure, scaffolding new services and managing co-changes and deployments with self-service actions and by following engineering and readiness standards with Scorecards.\nWe launched a Datadog MCP server to enable AI agents to obsess telemetry from Datadog and to act as a bridge between Datadog and MCP compatible AI agents, like OpenAI codec, cursor and for Anthropic. We work together with OpenAI to integrate our MCP server within the OpenAi codec CLI.\nAnd the Datadog cursor expansion now gives developers access to the observability data directly within the cursor ID. Third, we are reimagining observability to meet our customers' increasingly complex needs. Our APM latency investigator formulates and explores in the background helping teams to quickly isolate with causes and understand impact without through large amounts of data.\nProactive app recommendations help users stay ahead of growing system complexity by analyzing APM data to detect issues and propose fixes before they become problems. We announced a Flex Frozen tier, so customers can keep logs and fully managed storage for up to 7 years and be able to search with our data movement or rehydration.\nnow enables teams to query archive logs directly in cloud storage, like Flex Frozen Tier. And Datadog now supports advanced analysis features within notebooks.\nFourth, our security products cover new AI attack vectors across the application, model and data layers. At the AI data layer, sensitive data scanner can now prevent the leakage of sensitive data in training data as well as LLM prompts and responses.\nAt the model layer, we have secured against supply chain attacks in open source models, and prevent model hijacking attacks. At the application layer, we have prevent prompt injection attacks and data poisoning in real-time. And finally, we showcased our new end-to-end AI and data observability capabilities.\nEngineers and machine learning teams can use GPU monitoring to gain visibility into GPU fleets across cloud, on-prem and GPU-as-a-service platform, such as and With agent console, enterprises can monitor the behavior and interactions with any AI agent teams.\nWe now offer LLM observability experiments to help understand changes to prompt, models or AI providers in application outcomes. We added a new agentic flows visualization to LLM observability to capture and understand the decision path of AI agent.\nAnd last but not least, and accelerated by our recent acquisition of Metaplane, Datadog now offers a complete approach to data observability across the entire data life cycle from intention to transformation to downstream useage.\nSo we continue to relentlessly innovate to solve more problems for our customers. In doing so, we are being rightfully recognized by independent research, and we are pleased that for the fifth year in a row, Datadog has been named as a leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for observability platforms.\nWe believe that this validates our approach to deliver a unified platform, which silos across team. Now let's move on to sales and marketing. We had a number of great new logo wins and customer expansions this quarter.\nSo let's go through a few of those. First, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion in a 3-year contract worth more than $60 million with one of the world's largest banks. This company believes getting to the cloud is essential so they can use AI on their extremely rich dataset to improve how they manage risk and serve their customers.\nThey are using Datadog as their strategic cloud availability platform, and we continue to migrate more applications to the cloud. This customer is expanding to 21 Datadog products with thousands of users who log into the Datadog platform every month.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure expansion to an 8-figure unrealized contract with a leading U.S. insurance company. Datadog is supporting these customers' efforts to consolidate observability tools and expand their cloud-based products. By adopting Datadog, they are experiencing fewer and less severe incidents.\nWith estimated savings of over $9 million per year in incident response costs and improving more than 100,000 customer transactions that would otherwise be impacted every year. With this expansion, this customer would adopt 19 Datadog products and we'll consolidate a couple of dozen tools across multiple business units.\nNext, we signed a nearly 7-figure annualized expansion with the leading American media conglomerate. This customer has about 100 observability tools across more than 300 business units. And this tool fragmentation has resulted in inefficiencies in extra cost and loss engineering time.\nThey are expanding to 21 Datadog products, including all of our security products and replacing their solution with Datadog and incident management.\nNext, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a leading Brazilian e-commerce company. This customer's previous observability vendor was unable to support them as they move to newer software platforms and modern cloud infrastructure. By replacing these tool with Datadog, the company was able to gain full visibility to its cloud and saw significant improvements in application stability and incident resolution times. This customer will start with 7 Datadog products including\nNext, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with the delivery app of a major American retailer. This customer run and allow tracking products to be immediately valuable finding an issue on the first day of the Datadog trial that they hadn't identified after month of searching with their old tool.\nDatadog with 7 products to start, this customer will consolidate half a dozen tools while meeting their PCI compliance requirements.\nFinally, we welcome back a leading U.S. mortgage company in a nearly 7-figure annualized deal. This customer had moved to using a dozen open source disconnected tools, which led to fragmented visibility, and poor customer experience. In returning to Datadog, they plan to add up 6 products including replacing their paging system with Datadog\nAnd that's it for another productive quarter from our go-to-market teams who are now very hard at work on\nBefore I turn it over to David for a financial review, I want to say a few words on our longer-term outlook. There is no change to our overall view that digital transformation and cloud migration our long-term secular growth drivers of our business. As we think about AI, we are incredibly excited about our opportunities.\nFirst, AI is a tailwind for Datadog, as increased cloud consumption drives more usage of our platform. Today, we see this primarily in our AI native group of customers who are monitoring their cloud native applications with us. There are hundreds of customers in this group.\nThey include more than a dozen that are spending over $1 million a year with us and more than 80 who are spending more than $100,000. And they include 8 of the top 10 leading AI companies.\nWhile we know there's a lot of attention in this cohort, we primarily see it as an indication of what's to come, as companies of every size and every single industry incorporate AI into applications. And we continue to see rising customer interest for next-gen AI observability and analysis. Today, over 4,500 customers use one or more Datadog integrations.\nSecond, next-gen AI introduces new complexity and new observability challenges. For AI observability products help our customers gain visibility and deploy with confidence across their entire AI stack, including GPU monitoring, LLM observability, AI agent observability and data observability. And we will, of course, keep innovating as the AI landscape develops further.\nThird, we are incorporating AI into the Datadog platform to deliver more value to our customers. As I discussed earlier, we launched SRE agent and security agent. We are seeing very good results with those with more improvements and new capabilities to come.\nFinally, as a SaaS platform, focus on our customers' critical workflows, we have a large volume of reach clear and detailed data, which allows us to conduct ground-breaking research. A great example of that is our total model for Time Series Forecasting, which shows state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks, even going well beyond specialized observability use cases.\nAnd you should expect to see more from us on that front in the future as well as taking novel research approaches and models straight into our products to improve customer outcomes.\nSo we are extremely excited about our progress so far against what we expect to be a generational growth opportunity. In other words, we're just getting started. And with that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. Q2 revenue was $827 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. .\nNow to dive into some of the drivers of this Q2 revenue growth. First, overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing customers in Q2 that were higher than our expectations. This included strong growth in our AI native cohort as well as usage growth from the rest of the business that was consistent with recent quarters amidst a healthy and steady cloud migration environment.\nWe saw a continued rise in contribution from AI native customers in the quarter who represented about 11% of Q2 revenues up from 8% of revenues in the last quarter and about 4% of revenues in the year ago quarter. The AI native customers contributed about 10 points of year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 versus about 6 points last quarter and about 2 points in the year ago quarter.\nNow as previously discussed, we do see revenue concentration in this cohort in recent quarters. But if we look at our revenue without the largest customer in the AI native cohort, our year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 was stable relative to Q1.\nWe remain mindful that we may see volatility in our revenue growth on the backdrop of long-term volume growth in this cohort as customers renew with us on different terms and as they may choose to optimize cloud and observability usage over time.\nAs you heard from Oli, we continue to believe that adoption of AI will benefit Datadog in the long term, and we believe that the growth of this AI native customer group is an indication of the opportunity to come as AI is adopted more broadly and customers outside the AI native group begin to operate AI workloads in production.\nNow regarding usage growth by customer segment. In Q2, our year-over-year usage growth was fairly similar across segments relative to previous quarters. As and mid-market usage growth improved in Q2, while enterprise customer usage growth remain roughly stable. Note that we are excluding the AI native cohort for the purposes of this commentary.\nAnd as a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 or more employees, mid-market as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees and SMB as customers with less than 1,000 employees. Regarding our retention metrics. Our 12-month trailing net retention percentage was about 120, higher than the high 110s last quarter, and our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remains in the mid- to high 90s.\nNow moving on to our financial results. First, billings were $852 million, up 20% year-over-year. And remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $2.43 billion, up 35% year-over-year. Our current RPO growth was in the low 30s year-over-year and our RPO duration was up slightly year-over-year.\nAs previously mentioned, we continue to believe that revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO, as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nAnd now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nFirst, gross profit in the quarter was $669 million for a gross margin of 80.9%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.3% last quarter and 82.1% in the year ago quarter. As we've discussed in the last call, we saw an increasing impact of our engineers cost savings efforts throughout this quarter as they delivered on cloud efficiency projects.\nAnd we are continuing our focus on cloud efficiency, and believe that we have further opportunity for gross margin improvement in the second half of the year. Our Q2 OpEx grew 30% year-over-year, up from 29% last quarter. As we've communicated over the past year, we plan to grow our investments to pursue our long-term growth opportunities, and this OpEx growth is an indication of our execution on our hiring plans.\nQ2 operating income was $164 million for a 20% operating margin compared to 22% last quarter and 24% in the year ago quarter. Within that, as we've noted, we held our DASH user conference in June. And as expected, the event cost $13 million.\nWe also experienced a rising impact from the weaker dollar and absorbed $6 million of negative FX impact during Q2. Excluding those expenses, operating income would have been 22% in Q2 or 200 basis points higher.\nAnd now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. And our cash flow from operations was $200 million in the quarter, after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $165 million for a free cash flow margin of 20%.\nAnd now for our outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2025. First, our guidance philosophy overall remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on recent trends observed and apply conservatism on these growth trends. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $847 million to $851 million, which represents a 23% year-over-year growth.\nNon-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $176 million to $180 million, which implies an operating margin of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46 per share based on approximately 364 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor fiscal 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.312 billion to $3.322 billion, which represents a 23% to 24% year-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $684 million to $694 million, which implies an operating margin of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.83 per share based on approximately $364 million average diluted shares.\nSome additional notes on our guidance. We expect net interest and other income for fiscal 2025 to be approximately $150 million. And due to the impact of the recent federal tax legislation, we now expect cash taxes for 2025 to be about $10 million to $20 million. We continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 and going forward.\nAnd finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 4% to 5% of revenues in fiscal year 2025.\nTo summarize, we are pleased with our execution in Q2, including the many products and features we launched at DASH. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, including their adoption of AI.\nI want to thank all Datadog worldwide for their efforts. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin our Q&A."

Welcome to the Q1 2025 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Yuka Broderic, from -- SVP of Investor Relations.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nThank you, Anton. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's first quarter 2025 financial results we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the second year and the fiscal year 2025 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage trends.\nThe words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to the Form 10-K for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.\nWe will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors@datadoghq.com.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning to go through our Q1 results and was a solid start to the year. Let me begin with a review of our Q1 financial performance.\nRevenue was $762 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 30,500 customers, up from about 28,000 a year ago. We ended Q1 with about 3,770 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 3,340 a year ago. These customers generated about 88% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $244 million, with a free cash flow margin of 32%.\nTurning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q1, 83% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 82% a year ago. 51% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 47% a year ago. 28% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 23% a year ago. And 13% of our customers were using 8 or more products, up from 10% a year ago.\nWe are pleased to see that customers are adopting more products, and I'd like to highlight 2 of our newer products with you. First, Flex Logs is off to a fast start and now exceeds $50 million in ARR. Flex Logs have achieved this milestone in 6 quarters, which is the fastest ramp we've seen to that level, in which echoes its value to customers as well as the size of the log management market opportunity.\nI'll also note that by adopting Flex Logs, our customers are adding use cases at the right economics. And these Flex Logs adopters ultimately spend more on Datadog log management as well as more on our overall platform.\nSecond, our database monitoring product is approaching the $50 million ARR level as well and is growing 60% year-over-year. Datadog monitoring has now been adopted by over 5,000 customers. We are very excited about the early traction we're seeing there, and are doubling down on our investment into broader Datadog capability as we see strong demand signals in that area, and we'll come back to that in a few minutes.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing customers in Q1 that were in line with our expectations. We are seeing high growth in our AI cohort as well as consistent and stable growth in the rest of the business. We also had a strong bookings quarter, with particularly strong execution in new logos and larger bookings.\nDollar bookings for new logos were up over 70% year-over-year and much stronger than our typical seasonal softness in Q1. And on the large deal side, in Q1, we signed a total of 11 deals with a TCV of $10 million or more, up from just 1 in the year ago quarter, as we continue to expand our business with larger customers.\nFinally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention stable in mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\nNow moving on to R&D. We continue to see rising customer for next-gen AI capabilities and analysis. At the end of Q1, more than 4,000 customers used one or more Datadog AI integrations, and this number has doubled year-over-year. With end-to-end data observability, we are seeing continued growth in customers and usage as they seek to manage end-to-end motor performance, security and quality.\nI'll call out the fact that the number of companies using end-to-end data observability has more than doubled in the past 6 months. And we are adding to Bits AI, with capabilities for customers to take action with workflow automation and App Builder, using next GenAI to help our customers immediate issues more quickly and move towards auto remediation in the future.\nSumming up, we're making progress on all of our AI initiatives, and you should expect more announcements in this area at DASH, out user conference taking place in June.\nMoving to security. Our teams have been very busy building our products and features for our customers' data ops needs. To give you a quick overview of our capabilities. First, we have a comprehensive set of products to identify and manage vulnerability across software and infrastructure.\nIn infrastructure, our cloud security product identifies vulnerabilities in hosts, container disability clusters and infrastructure as a code. Our security customers can use agentless scanning to cover their entire infrastructure stack in minutes. And existing Datadog customers using our lightweight agent immediately gained deep, granular and timely security visibility.\nOn the application vulnerability side, our code security product identifies vulnerabilities in code from development to production, and for first-party code as well as third-party open source libraries. This product area has launched recently and already has over 1,000 customers paying for the product.\nBecause we bring visibility to production workloads, we are uniquely positioned to identify which vulnerabilities are most critical in production and break down silos between developers, DevOps and security teams.\nSecond, in security. As vulnerabilities face threats and attacks, our threat management product helps our customers identify and remediate them. They can use our cloud team to identify threats in logs, and they can further protect from threats in infrastructure with work action; and in software, with app and API protection.\nFinally, our customers use our sensitive data scanner product to discover, classify and redact sensitive data at scale across their logs, traces, events, user sessions, data stores code and all the way to LLM prompts. But we have much more to do. Today, we are serving over 7,500 customers of security products or about 1/4 of our total customer base. Over half of our Fortune 500 customers use our security products, a good sign of our opportunities with the largest enterprises.\nNow moving on from security. Last month, we announced our plans to launch our latest data center in Australia. We see a large opportunity to serve our Australian customers and help them meet local data residency, privacy and security requirements.\nFinally, we really announced a couple of acquisitions. First, we acquired Eppo, a next-generation future management and experimentation platform. The Eppo platform helps increase the velocity of releases, while also lowering risk by helping customers to release and validate features in a controlled manner.\nEppo augments our efforts in product analytics, helping customers improve the variance and tie feature performance to business outcomes. More broadly, we see automated experimentation as a key part of modern application development, with the rapid adoption of the agent generative code, as well as more and more of the application logic itself being implemented with nondeterministic AI models.\nSecond, we also acquired Metaplane, the data absorbability platform built for modern data teams. Metaplane helps prevent, detect and resolve their availability and quality issues across the company's data warehouses and data pipelines. We've seen for several years now that better freshness and quality were critical for applications and business analytic. And we believe that they are becoming key enablers of the creation of new enterprise AI workloads, which is why we intend to integrate the Metaplane capabilities into our end-to-end dataset offerings.\nWe are very excited to welcome both the Metaplane and the Eppo teams to Datadog as we have a lot to build together, and that fits for product and engineering. Our teams are very hard work this quarter, and we're looking forward to sharing many new products and feature announcements at our DASH user conference on June 10 and 11 in New York City.\nNow let's move on to SaaS en market. As I mentioned earlier, we have a number of great new logo wins and customer expansions this quarter. So let's go through a few of those.\nFirst, we landed a [ 7-figure ] annualized deal with one of the largest U.S. manufacturers. This customer has a complex hybrid environment, including on-prem, multiple clouds, in-car IoT and mobile apps. They expect to unify observability across teams and across all their tech stacks, while accelerating workload analysis. And they are starting with 13 Datadog products, consolidating a dozen tool and rolling out to dozens of business units.\nNext, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a major Latin American bank. They expect to use our unified observability to reduce operational costs and enable autonomy for departments that previously had to depended on specialized teams for visibility. This customer is starting with 6 Datadog products and is replacing 3 existing tools.\nNext, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a major American tech supplies company. These customers struggle with Tools Pro and limited use option. With Datadog, they expect to save over $1 million every year, both in engineering time and avoidance of lost revenue. This customer is starting with 11 Datadog products, including Cloud SIEM, and is replacing 7 commercial tools.\nNext, we welcome back an insurance tech customer with a 6-figure annualized deal. This customer found that their previous authority tool involved manual workflows and customization, a high operational overhead and user frustration and fatigue. By returning to Datadog, they expect to benefit from Datadog's ease of use and out-of-the-box capabilities, while using our built-in usage controls and observability and cloud costs. This customer now expects to use Flex Logs, Cloud Cost Management and OnCall, among the 10 products [indiscernible].\nNext, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with one of the largest U.S. health insurers. This customer is using Datadog across dozens of business units to support millions of customers. More recently, they have been using Datadog to significantly improve customer experience and reduce time-consuming and expensive outages.\nAs an example, one team estimated reductions in mean time to resolution from 3 to 4 hours down to 3 to 4 minutes by using Datadog. With this expansion, this customer is using 17 products in the Datadog platform, including the 4 Datadog security suite.\nFinally, we signed a 7-figure expansion as an annualized contract with a leading next GenAI company. This customer needs to reduce tool fragmentation to keep on top of its hyper growth in usage and employee headcount. With this expansion, the customer will use 5 Datadog products and will replace commercial tool for APM and log management. And that's it for another productive quarter from our go-to-market teams.\nBefore I turn it over to David for a financial review, let's have a few words on our longer-term outlook. We recognize that there are many cross curves impacting the global economy right now. But our view of our long-term market opportunities remains unchanged. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business, as well as critical for every company to deliver value and gain competitive advantage.\nAnd we continue to focus on delivering innovation and value to our customers against their mission-critical needs, including their AI efforts. Now more than ever, we feel ideally positioned to help customers of every size and in every industry to transform, innovate and drive value for technology adoption.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. Q1 revenue was $762 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of Q1 revenue growth. First, overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing customers in line with our expectations and similar to the second half of 2024.\nWe saw a continued rise in contribution from AI-native customers who represented about 8.5% of Q1 ARR, up from about 6% of ARR last quarter and up from about 3.5% of ARR in the year ago quarter. AI native customers contributed about 6 points of year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 versus about 5 points last quarter and about 2 points in the year ago quarter.\nWe continue to believe that adoption of AI will benefit Datadog in the long term, but we remain mindful that we may see volatility in our revenue growth on the backdrop of long-term volume growth from this cohort as customers renew with us on different terms and as they may choose to optimize cloud and observability usage.\nNext, regarding usage growth by customer segment. Year-over-year usage growth with our enterprise customers remain healthy, a bit lower than last quarter, which we see as a product of the volatility that can occur among customers from quarter-to-quarter. Meanwhile, we saw strong booking activity from our enterprise customers in Q1. And as Olivier noted, this included some large TCV deals.\nFrom our SMB and mid-market customers, excluding the AI cohort, year-over-year usage growth was roughly similar compared to last quarter. As a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 employees or more, mid-market as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, and SMB as customers with less than 1,000 employees.\nLooking ahead to April, our usage growth was consistent with the year-to-date trends. As usual, we have contemplated near-term trends in our guidance. Regarding retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention percentage was in the high 0.10% in Q1, similar to last quarter. Finally, our trailing 12-month gross retention revenue percentage remained stable in the mid- to high 90s.\nOn new logos, gross new logo additions were roughly the same as in Q1 last year, but dollar new logos increased 70% year-over-year, indicating a higher average land in the SMB, mid-market and enterprise sectors. And our pipeline for Q2 is strong and growing healthily year-over-year. As a reminder, our sales pipeline doesn't convert into revenue immediately.\nNow moving on to our financial results. Billings were $748 million, up 21% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $2.31 billion, up 33% year-over-year and current RPI growth was about 30% year-over-year. RPO duration was roughly flat year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends, and it lends to RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nFirst, gross profit in the quarter was $612 million and gross margins was 80.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 81.7% in the last quarter and 83.3% in the year ago quarter. While gross margin remained in the range that we have expected over the long term, our cloud hosting costs rose more quickly than we expected in Q1, as we supported large growth spikes from some of our largest customers.\nWe also continue to innovate with new products and capabilities for our customers, which tend to put downward pressure on gross margins in the short term. While we expect some of the costs to support customers persist, we are also focused on executing projects to improve our cloud cost efficiency and expect to realize savings throughout the rest of the year.\nOur Q1 OpEx grew 29% year-over-year, similar to the 30% last quarter and -- as expected as we continue to execute on our hiring plans. As we have spoken about in previous quarters, it has been our plan to grow our investments to pursue our long-term growth opportunities. And we've been successful in increasing sales rep headcount with over 25% year-over-year growth in total reps, including over 30% growth year-over-year in enterprise reps.\nThis investment has been weighted a little bit towards international expansion, where sales rep headcount growth was in the mid-30s percent year-over-year. We believe that there is white space to support this growth and that we will keep seeing results as this capacity ramps as we have in the past.\nIn addition, we grew our R&D headcount by over 30% year-over-year, with R&D expense as a percent of sales at 30% in Q1, so we delivered on the rapid pace of innovation for our customers. Always, we continue to prioritize our investments to balance near-term adjustments with our long-term plans and continue to look for opportunities to optimize our operating costs. Q1 operating income was $167 million for a 22% operating margin compared to 24% last quarter and 27% in the year ago quarter.\nNow turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and market securities. Cash flow from operations was $272 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration CapEx capitalized software, free cash flow was $244 million for a free cash flow margin of 32%.\nAnd now for our outlook for the second quarter and the full fiscal year 2025. First, our guidance philosophy overall remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends.\nSo for the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $787 million to $791 million, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $148 million to $152 million, which implies an operating margin of 19%. As a reminder, in Q2, we will be hosting our DASH user conference, which we estimate to cost about $13 million and which we have reflected in our operating income guidance.\nNon-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.40 to $0.42 per share based on approximately 361 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. To note, weighted average diluted share count is expected to decline sequentially as the share related to the 2025 convertible note will be removed upon redemption.\nFor fiscal year 2025, in total, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.215 billion to $3.235 billion, which represents a growth rate of 20% to 21%. Now we have raised our 2025 revenue guidance range by $40 million related to the previous guidance, which incorporates higher revenues in the first half of 2025 based on our Q1 results and our visibility as of today into Q2. Our implied guidance in the second half of 2025 is roughly unchanged.\nNon-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $625 million to $645 million, which implies an operating margin of 19% to 20%. Relative to our previous operating income guidance range of $655 million to $675 million, the difference is mainly due to lower gross profit as a result of the previously discussed lower gross profit margin, offset by higher revenues.\nAs we said before, we're focused on executing cost efficiencies in our cloud costs and believe our gross margins will remain in our historical range. Overall, plans for OpEx investment are roughly unchanged, with continued investment in hiring across R&D and sales and marketing.\nThere are some changes with distribution within that. We expect $15 million of higher international costs due to currency rate changes and $10 million in net expected additional costs from our recently announced acquisition, offset by other OpEx savings. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.71 per share based on approximately 362 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nAnd finally, some additional notes on the guidance. The remaining approximately $635 principal of our 2025 convertible notes will mature in June and we expect to redeem this mainly in cash. We estimate that the GAAP purchase price from our Q2 acquisition activity will be about $180 million, of which we estimate about $110 million to be paid in cash during Q2.\nWe expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2025 to be approximately $140 million, and we expect cash taxes to be about 1% of revenue or about $30 million to $35 million. We continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 and going forward. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 4% to 5% of revenue range in the year.\nFinally, to summarize, we are pleased with our execution in Q1. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective clients with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys. And I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts.\nNow with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thanks."

Welcome to the Q4 2024 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nThank you, Daniel. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's fourth quarter 2024 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO. .\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025 and related notes and assumptions our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends.\nThe words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations.

We had a strong Q4 to end a very productive year. During 2024 we kept building and innovating as we scaled up our teams and went broader and deeper into the problems we solve for our customers from the cloud to AI.\nWe continue to add new customers and expand with existing ones and we delivered more value as customers adopted more products in the Datadog platform. Let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. Revenue was $738 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range.\nWe ended with about 30,000 customers, up from about 27,300 a year ago. We ended Q4 with about 3,610 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 3,190 a year ago. These customers generated about 88% of our ARR. We had 462 customers with ARR of $1 million or more compared to $396 a year ago. And we generated free cash flow of $241 million with a free cash flow margin of 33%.\nTurning to customer adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4 83% of customers were using 2 or more products, which is about the same as last year. 50% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 47% a year ago. 6% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 22% a year ago and 12% of our customers were using 8 or more products, up from 9% a year ago.\nDuring 2024, we continue to land and expand with larger customers. As of December 2024, 45% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 42% in 2023. We think many of the largest enterprises are still very early in the journey to the cloud. The median Datadog ARR for our Fortune 500 customers is still less than $0.5 million, which gives a very large opportunity for us to grow with these customers.\nSo we're serving more customers with more products, and we are also very pleased to celebrate several milestones for the business. First, our total ARR now exceeds $3 billion, a big achievement for all of us at Datadog even though we're still only just getting started. And we have achieved this milestone largely by growing our first product infastructure monitoring and expanding into the other pillars of APM and log management.\nToday, Infrastruction Monitoring contributes over $1.25 billion in ARR. So we didn't stopped there as Log Management is now over $750 million in ARR and so is our third pillar as our end to NAPM products together also exceed $750 million in ARR. Note that end-to-end ATM includes all the Datadog products our customers use to monitor the applications, which are core APM, Continuous Profiler, Database Monitoring and Tracking as well as Synthetics and Real User Monitoring.\nNow remember that even in the 3 pillars of observability, we are still just getting started as more than half of our customers do not buy all 3 pillars from us or at least not yet. Meanwhile, we're making progress with our other products, and we are pleased to see them increasing in customer usage and growth. Products outside the 3 pillars now contribute over $200 million in ARR and we are excited about our growth opportunities in the many new products in this group.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q4, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was roughly similar to the year ago quarter. Our usage growth during the quarter generally played out as expected, including a stronger October and November and the slowdown we typically see at the end of December. We continue to experience a stable business environment and our customers overall are growing their cloud usage, while some are continuing to be cost conscious.\nWe also hit a new record in bookings this quarter as our go-to-market teams executed on our first ever quarter with over $1 billion in bookings. As a reminder, our bookings don't translate immediately into revenue growth. but it is an indicator that we continue to serve our new and existing customers as well, and they are coming with us over time.\nFinally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers. Moving on to R&D and what we built in 2024. A release over 400 new features and capabilities this year. Not as too much for us to go back today, but let's go over some of our innovations.\nFirst, we continue to improve the Datadog platform. We now have more than 850 integrations, making it easy for our customers to bring in every type of data they need benefits from all the new AWS Azure, GCP and OCI capabilities and engage with the latest technologies like the newly emerging AI stack. We announced Community's auto scaling to help customers rightsize cumulative environments without impacting stability and performance.\nWe launched Datadog Monitoring for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure so customers can now monitor their OCI stack and unify their monitoring across all clouds and on-prem environments. And we took several big steps to expand on Datadog as the best observability platform for pentenemetry users including making our infra monitoring and APM instrumentation fully interoperable with components and improving the experience for customers by embedding the collector directly within In the next-gen AI and L&M space, we continue to add capabilities to AI, launching for incident management and previewing AI for autonomous investigations.\nWe launched LLM observability, in general availability to help customers evaluate, safely deploy and manage their models in production, and we continue to see increased interest in next-gen AI. At the end of Q4, about 3,500 customers use 1 or more Datadog AI integrations to send this data about their machine learning, AI and In the end to space, our error tracking product now allows customers to view and manage errors across user stations, applications and logs, all in 1 place.\nWe kept building out better observability, including the launch of data job monitoring to help data engineers detect problematic jobs anywhere in their pipelines. And we expanded the technologies we can provide deep insights into such as Amazon SQS, in data stream monitoring and MongoDB in database monitoring.\nIn Digital Experience, our customers can now use our mobile app testing to test iOS and Android applications on real mobile phones. We allow faster investigation of mobile app issues with mobile station replay. And while product analytics remain in early stages, we are encouraged by customer interest in using Datadog to analyze user behavior for better business outcomes. In log management, Flex Logs launched into general availability, and customers can now cost-effectively retain and analyze massive volumes of data over long periods of time.\nWe expanded workspaces for advanced analytics and query. And we simplified the deployment of observability pipelines with new out-of-the-box template and granular configuration options. In cloud security, we now have more than 7,000 customers using 1 or more security products. We launched agentless scanning to detect risks and vulnerabilities within hosts, containers and cells across a whole cloud account in a few clicks.\nWe shipped Datadog infrastructure as code security, so our customers can identify and fix misconfigurations in their Terraform and Platformation code. Our customers can now use Kubernetes security posture management to benchmark their environments against industry-based practices. We launched code security to detect venerability in first-party code running in production environments.\nWe continue to expand on our software and position analysis capabilities. And we built many more integrations, content packs and investigative workflows into our cloud SIM product. In software delivery, Developers can now use Datadog code security with quality gates to ensure production code needs quality, security and performance standards. And we announced the ability for customers to observe Dora metrics to improve the speed and efficiency of the engineering teams.\nIn Cloud Service Management, we launched our modern scheduling solution, Datadog OnCall for general availability last month. We are already seeing significant customer interest and are excited to solve this problem for our users.\nWe launched Event Management for general availability using AI Ops to intelligently aggregate, consolidate and simplify alerts from any sources. We built out our case management functionality. So users can triage, assign and close production-related tickets faster. And finally, our ad builder product, let's use our build apps to implement their own custom processes and workflows and take action directly within Datadog.\nSo I'd like to thank our product and engineering teams for a very productive 2024. And I'm super excited about what we will have planned for 2025. Let's move on to sales and marketing. We had a strong close to 2024 with record bookings and some very exciting new logos and expansions. Let's go through a few.\nFirst, 7-figure annualized deal with a major U.S. financial institution. This company was struggling with high costs and expansive logging tools. By using Datadog logs and observability pipelines, this customer expects to save money on log management, and we'll redeploy those savings to invest in observability transformation.\nThis customer is starting with 4 Datadog products and is replacing 4 commercial and open-source stores. Next, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a large Brazilian retail company. This company had built a homegrown open source base observability, but had poor visibility into customer journeys for their shopping application.\nWith Datadog, they quickly improved application performance, which drove higher app store ratings, better digital reputation and improved user confidence. This customer is starting with 5 Datadog products.\nNext, we 6-figure annualized deal with the leading American entertainment company. This company had limited visibility into their customers' experience on in-store kiosks and on their mobile app. By using Datadog platform, this company will correct monitoring across front and back end and enable multiple teams to collaborate for improved customer experience. This land deal featured our brand-new product analytic capabilities and will displace 2 commercial observability and analytics tools.\nNext, we landed a high 6-figure annualized deal with a U.S. reginal health insurance company. This company's Medicare Services business requires a SIM, but SIM tool was expensive and poorly adopted by the teams. They will now rely on both Flex Log and our team within GovCloud for significant cost savings, all that while improving security and compliance.\nAnd we have the opportunity to provide additional value and expand to 3 pillar end-to-end observability over time. Next, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 100 oil and gas company. This customer is moving thousands of hosts from on-prem to the cloud and will replace 2 legacy infrastructure and network monitoring tools.\nThe estimated cost and productivity savings from accessing these legacy tools exceed $1 million annually. And we work with them to evaluate the productivity gains when thousands of users saw less reception by incidents for expected savings of over $10 million per year.\nThis customer is expanding to use 14 Datadog products. Last for today, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion who's a leading security software company. This customer built a homegrown log management tool using open source software, but it was time consuming to maintain extremely costly and perform poorly with unacceptable delays.\nBy moving to Flex Logs, this customer is already sitting on to cost, producing mean time to resolution and increasing user productivity with estimated savings over $1 million a year. And this customer is expanding to use 8 Datadog products. And that's it for this quarter's highlights.\nCongrats again to our go-to-market team for their great work in 2024, our best ever close to the year and the exciting plans we've laid out for 2021. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review. A few words on our longer-term outlook. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business as well as critical for every company to deliver value and gain competitive advantage. And we think moving to modern cloud-based technologies is more important than ever as more companies step up to adopt AI capabilities.\nWe continue to focus on delivering innovation and value to our customers against their mission critical needs. And more than ever, we feel ideally positioned to help customers of every size in every industry to transform, innovate and drive value through technology adoption. And with that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. To start, Q4 revenue was $738 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q4 revenue growth. Overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing customers that were consistent with our expectations. We continue to see conditions that were similar to recent quarters and roughly stable throughout 2024 with continued movement to cloud and modern DevOps technologies, and with customers remaining cost conscious and seeking efficiency and value from their spend.\nIn Q4, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was roughly similar to the usage growth in the year ago quarter. Next, we continue to see robust contribution from AI native customers who represented about 6% of Q4 ARR roughly the same as the quarter as last quarter and up from about 3% of ARR in the year ago quarter. AI native customers contributed about 5 percentage points of year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 versus 4 points in the last quarter and about 3 points in the year ago quarter.\nSo we saw strong growth from AI native customers in Q4. We believe that adoption of AI will continue to benefit Datadog in the long term. Meanwhile, we did see some optimization and volume discounts related to contract renewals in Q4. We remain mindful that we may see volatility in our revenue growth on the backdrop of long-term volume growth from this cohort as customers renew with us on different terms, and as they may choose to optimize cloud and observability usage.\nNext, as we look at usage growth by segment. Similar to recent quarters, we are seeing the strongest year-over-year usage growth from our enterprise customers. Meanwhile, our SMB customers' usage growth remained solid with slight year-over-year acceleration versus last quarter. As a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 employees or more mid-market as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees and SMB as customers with less than 1,000 employees.\nRegarding our retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention percentage was in the high in Q4 compared to the mid- last quarter. And finally, our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remained stable in the mid- to high 90s. Regarding our customer growth, we added 800 net customers in Q4 for a total of around 30,000 customers.\nThis includes the highest number of gross new logos and dollar new logo annualized bookings since early 2023. Now moving to our financial results. Billings were $908 million, up 26% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $2.27 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-20s percent year-over-year.\nOur duration was down year-over-year. Normalizing for duration, RPO growth was in the mid-30s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO, as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $603 million for a gross margin of 81.7% this compares to a gross margin of 81.1% last quarter and 83.4% in the year-ago quarter.\nOur Q4 OpEx grew 30% year-over-year accelerating from 21% last quarter as we continue to execute on our hiring plans. This includes our successful investment in sales and marketing, which grew 31% year-over-year in Q4 and 2024 to 23% of revenues, up from 5% year-over-year growth in Q4 of 2023 at 22% of revenues.\nWe ended 2024 with sales and marketing headcount of about 3,000, up from about 2,400 at the end of 2023. This also includes our successful investment in R&D, which grew 29% year-over-year in Q4 2024 to 29% of revenues, up from 15% year-over-year growth in Q4 last year at 28% of revenues. We ended 2024 with R&D headcount of about 3,100, up from 2,400 at the end of 2023.\nQ4 operating income was $179 million or a 24% operating margin compared to 25% last quarter and 28% in the year ago quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In December, we issued a 5-year $1 billion convertible note. We used $122 million of the proceeds for transaction costs and cap calls associated with these notes.\nAnd simultaneous with the issuance of these notes, we've repurchased approximately 15% of our outstanding 2025 convertible notes and terminated the associated cap calls for net cost of $142 million. After taking into account this issuance and repurchasing activity, our cash balance increased by $736 million net. $636 million principal amount of the 2025 convertible notes and associated cap calls remains outstanding, and we expect to retire the outstanding amount of the 2025 notes on or before their maturity date of June 15, 2025.\nCash flow from operations was $265 million in the quarter. After taking into account capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $241 million for a free cash flow margin of 33%. And now for our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025. First, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged.\nAs a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months, and apply conservatism on these growth trends. So for the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $737 million to $741 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $162 million to $166 million which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.41 to $0.43 per share based on approximately 366 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nAnd for the full fiscal year 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $3.75 billion to $3.195 billion, which represents 18% to 19% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $655 million to $675 million, which implies an operating margin of 21%.\nAnd non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70 per share based on approximately 369 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Now for some additional notes on this guidance. As it relates to our growth in OpEx and hiring. First, we successfully executed on our hiring plans in 2024, and ending the year with about 6,500 employees, growing 27% year-over-year.\nAnd we remain excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities. Our operating profit guidance reflects our intent to continue to invest for future growth in 2025. Because of that, our operating profit guidance implies operating expense growth in the high 20s percent range year-over-year. As we did in 2024, we expect to grow our investments in both sales and marketing and R&D this year. As I discussed earlier, in Q4, sales and marketing expenses grew 31% year-over-year and R&D expense grew 29% year-over-year.\nWe continue to expand our capabilities in sales and marketing, including expanding in our less mature geographies, adding more channel and alliance capabilities and extending our efforts around larger enterprises, among many other initiatives. And in R&D, we are focused on delivering more value to our customers, both in expanding the number of products for our customers and the capabilities we add as part of the Datadog platform.\nMeanwhile, we continue to balance our investments in long-term growth with financial discipline, as we have executed in the past. Now turning to the other areas of the P&L. First, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal 2025 to be approximately $120 million. Regarding taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate is 21% in fiscal year 2025, and this is reflected in our non-GAAP net income per share guidance.\nNext, we expect our cash taxes in 2025 to be about 1% of 2025 revenues were about $30 million to $35 million. While we have utilized the majority of our U.S.-based NOLs, we have R&D tax credits and deductions related to stock-based compensation that reduced our cash tax payments. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 4% to 5% of revenues range in 2025.\nNow to summarize, we are pleased with our execution in 2024. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys. And we continue to invest in our growth opportunities in 2025. And I want to thank all Datadogs worldwide for their efforts last year, and I'm very excited about our plans for this year.\nAnd with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

We had a very productive second quarter. First, we welcomed thousands of Datadog users to our DASH conference in June where we announced a broad range of exciting new products and new features for customers to observe, secure and act in their cloud environment. And we continue to add new customers and help existing ones as they grow in the cloud.\nLet me start with a review of our Q2 financial performance. Revenue was $645 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 28,700 customers, up from about 26,100 a year ago. We had about 3,390 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,990 last year, and these customers generated about 87% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $144 million with a cash flow margin of 22%.\nTurning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 82% a year ago. 49% of customers were using four or more products, up from 45% a year ago. 25% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 21% a year ago. And 11% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 7% a year ago.\nWe continue to expand the capabilities of all of our products over time, enabling our customers to solve more of their critical challenges. This includes our efforts in digital experience monitoring, an area of observability, which includes synthetics and real user monitoring or RUM. And both synthetics and RUM are seeing growing adoption and each product today represents more than $100 million in ARR, becoming our fourth and fifth products to achieve that milestone.\nWe have also been innovating rapidly in this area with recent capabilities, including mobile app testing, future flag testing, user journey visualization and retention analysis. And with our recent announcement of product analytics at DASH, we are excited to go further and allow our customers to consolidate more of their usage and business insights into Datadog.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, the business environment for Datadog was roughly unchanged from last quarter. Our customers overall are growing their cloud usage, while some are continuing to be cost conscious. In Q2, we saw existing customer usage growth that was broadly in line with our expectation and consistent with the overall improved trend that we have experienced over the past several quarters. Our usage growth with existing customers was higher than in the year-ago quarter. And we saw continued healthy growth across our product lines with newer products growing faster from a smaller base. Finally, churn continues to be low and gross revenue retention was stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\nMoving on to R&D. We had our DASHes of conference in late June, and we are excited to announce many new products and features for our users. We have too much for us to cover in detail, but let me review just some of the announcements we made in the past 3 months.\nIn the next-gen AI space, we announced the general availability of LLM Observability, which application developers and machine learning engineers to efficiently monitor, troubleshoot and secure LLM applications. With LLM Observability, companies can accelerate the deployment of AI applications into production environments and reliably operate and scale them.\nWe also expanded Bits AI with new capabilities. As a reminder, Bits AI is a Datadog built-in AI copilot. In addition to being able to summarize incidents and answer questions, we previewed at DASH, the ability for Bits AI to operate as an agent and perform autonomous investigations. With this capability, this AI proactively surfaces key information and performs complex tasks such as investigating alerts and coordinating -- response.\nTaking a step back and looking at our customer base, we continue to see a lot of excitement around AI technologies. All customers are telling us that they are leveling up on AI and ramping experimentations with the goal of delivering additional business value with AI. And we can see them doing this. Today, about 2,500 customers use one or more of our AI integrations to get visibility into their increasing use of AI. We also continue to grow our business with -- customers. which increased to over 4% of our ARR in June. We see this as a sign of the continued expansion of this ecosystem and of the value of using Datadog to monitor the product environment. I will note that over time, we think this metric will become less relevant as AI usage and production broadens beyond this group of customers.\nLast, but not least, we announced [ TOTO ], our first foundational model for time -- forecasting, which delivered state-of-the-art performance on all 11 benchmarks. In addition to the technical innovations devised by our research team, TOTO derives its record performance from the quality of our training dataset and points to our unique ability to train, build and incorporate AI models into a platform that will meaningfully improve operations for our customers.\nMoving on from AI. We have a lot more to show in observability. We announced the general availability of Flex Logs, which extends our logging with limited approach and allows our customers to scale storage and compute separately for cost efficiency. And our customers can today use our new Log Workspaces for log analysis. Log Workspaces is an advanced analytics feature that allows users to connect datasets, build and realize complex queries and create usable composable views and reports. It is particularly relevant to customers who previously built sophisticated analysis and workflows in legacy log management tools.\nWe announced the general availability of Data Jobs Monitoring, which allows data engineers to detect and fix issues with our Spark and Databricks workloads and to optimize the cost and performance of their data jobs.\nMoving and transforming large amounts of data has grown in importance and become a mission-critical capability for many businesses, a trend that we believe will continue with the adoption of AI. With this, our data observability set of products is expanding. Data Jobs Monitoring works alongside our Data Streams Monitoring product, which helps customers understand the -- pipelines involving components such as [indiscernible]. And we're increasingly providing visibility for data lakes and data warehouses, such as Snowflake, to deliver end-to-end data observability across customers better resources.\nMoving on from data observability. We introduced capability [ photo scaling ] to allow customers to optimize for cost and performance by automatically rightsizing company resources.\nFor our customers using OpenTelemetry, the Datadog Agent will embed a fully configurable OpenTelemetry Collector, giving hotel customers access to Datadog products such as container network and universal service monitoring and offering our customers what we believe will be the best fully managed OpenTelemetry experience in the market.\nIn shifting left, our new Live Debugger, enables developers to step through code directly in production environments and find the exact root code of production errors.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are building up on our success in digital experience monitoring, and we announced Product Analytics, providing in-depth product and user insights for product managers and business owners.\nIn the cloud security space, we launched a new application security capability called Code Security, which allows our customers to detect and prioritize code-level vulnerability in their products and applications. We also announced Data Security, which allows our customers to automatically pinpoint sensitive data, starting in AWS today and expanding to other environments in the future. And for instances where customers can't or don't want to deploy agents, our new agentless scanning capability provides visibility into risks and vulnerabilities within host, containers and several functions without requiring agents to be installed.\nFinally, in the cloud service management space, we're going further to allow our customers to take action directly within Datadog platform. We announced the general availability of App Builder, which lets teams rapidly create self-service local applications and integrate them securely into their monitoring staff. And we introduced Datadog On-Call, a modern on-call experience with paging and incident management workflows pre-integrated with observability.\nSo let's move on now to sales and marketing. We again saw strong execution from our go-to-market teams this quarter, and we added some exciting new customers while expanding with many more. So I'll go through a few examples.\nFirst, we landed our largest ever new logo win, a multiyear deal with total contract value in the tens of millions of dollars with one of the largest banks in South America. This customer was using a commercial observability product as well as open source tools, but didn't have full stack visibility. With Datadog, they will enable end-to-end observability. And they expect to transition to modern infrastructure, sorry, with confidence. They also anticipate better management and predictability of their observability costs, thanks to products such as Flex Logs.\nNext, we signed a seven-figure annualized land deal with one of the world's largest travel management companies. This company was using a commercial lot management tool, but find it expensive and complex to support. They're also worried about stability as the tool with crash and [ cause fires ] across the organization. By moving to Datadog and replacing this tool, they expect to drive significant savings with log management and will benefit from our unified platform across infrastructure monitoring and APM.\nNext, we landed a seven-figure annualized land with a security software company. This customer felt their overspending on their commercial volume tool and lack of visibility led to issues catching incidents with users notifying them first about this. This customer has now obtained the Datadog unified platform across all three dealers and displacing one commercial and two open source -- in the process. This customer also expects net savings of $0.5 million every year by switching to Datadog.\nNext, we signed a seven-figure annual extension with the leading central bank in Europe. This institution became a Datadog customer 3 years ago, to enable its ambitious plan to move half of its applications to the cloud over a couple of years. And they have been increasing the usage of Datadog as they move into the cloud, displacing two commercial observability tools, which they use in their on-premise environment. They have now added a total of 17 Datadog products.\nNext, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a large American insurance company. The customer had been using Datadog for full stack of observability at one business unit. With this [ intention ], they have chosen Datadog as enterprise-wide observability provider. In comparing us to the performance of other tools, this customer measured stronger developer adoption and fewer incidents with Datadog. And in displacing its legacy APM and log management, they expect to save over $1 million annually on tool costs alone.\nFinally, we signed a high seven-figure annualized expansion with a leading online gambling and entertainment platform. This long-time customer uses Datadog as its strategic observability partner, enabling full visibility across infrastructure, applications, logs, network and their public -- them with users spanning from hands-on keyboard engineers all the way to their sea level -- This renewal support its customers' expansion into new use cases to have security embedded into the operations by using all of our cloud security products, to build a culture of cost accountability with cloud management, and to take action -- management and workflow automation. And this customer to date has adopted 19 products in the Datadog platform. And that's it for another productive quarter from our go-to-market teams.\nNow let me say a few words on our longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change to the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We are seeing continued experimentation with new technologies, including next-gen AI, and we believe this is just one of the many factors that will drive greater use of the cloud and next-gen infrastructure.\nAs indicated by our many announcements at our [ DASH conference ], we are delivering rapid innovation at scale. And we are helping our customers every day to deploy and scale the model environment with confidence across observability, digital experience, cloud security, cloud service management, software delivery and product analytics.\nFinally, I'd like to welcome two new leaders to our team Yanbing Li is joining us as our Chief Product Officer. Yanbing has more than 25 years of product, technology and engineering experience, spanning enterprise software, -- structure and AI at companies such as VMware, Google and Aurora. She will lead our product team's efforts to expand and adopt platform.\nAnd David Galloreese is joining us as our Chief People Officer. David has more than 20 years of HR experience at tech companies and large-scale high-visibility enterprises, such as Sigma, Wells Fargo or Walmart. He will help us drive the next sector of growth and scale at Datadog.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier, and good morning to all. Q2 revenues was -- were $645 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q2 revenue growth, first, regarding usage growth from existing customers. The overall trend we saw was consistent with our expectations.\nIn Q2, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than usage growth in the year-ago quarter. And as we look across the first half of 2024, our usage growth was higher than the first half of 2023. And we are seeing solid growth across our products. Our three pillar products continue to increase in customer penetration and usage and our newer products across observability, cloud security and cloud service management are ramping.\nRegarding usage growth by customer size in Q2, we saw strong performance amongst our largest customers who spend multiple millions of dollars with us annually, as they continue to return to growth and strike a balance between new deployment and focus on optimization. As we look at usage growth by segment, we saw the strongest growth with our enterprise customers, where year-over-year growth in usage has accelerated over the past several quarters. Over the same period, we have seen more steady year-over-year growth trends amongst our SMB and mid-market customers. As a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 employees or more, mid-market as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees and SMB as customers with less than 1,000 employees.\nRegarding our retention metrics, our net revenue retention percentage was in the mid-110s in Q2, similar to the past couple of quarters. But remember, this is a trailing 12-month measure, and we've seen an increase in recent quarters as we look at the NRR quarterly trend. And finally, our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remained stable in the mid- to high 90s.\nNow moving on to our financial results. Billings were $667 million, up 28% year-over-year and similar to the trailing 12 months [indiscernible] year-over-year growth. Billings duration was roughly flat versus a year ago. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, was $1.79 billion, up 43% year-over-year. As we said before, contract duration has generally been increasing as customers choose more multiyear deals and contract duration increased modestly in the year-over-year period relative to a year ago.\nCurrent RPO growth was in the [ mid-30s ] percent year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate on a quarterly basis relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nGross profit in the quarter was $530 million, representing a gross margin of 82.1%. This compares to a gross margin of 83.3% in the last quarter and 81.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 OpEx grew 21% year-over-year and increased from 14% year-over-year growth last quarter. Oli mentioned last quarter, Q2 OpEx included $11 million in expenses related to our DASH user conference. And as we've discussed, we are investing in headcount in 2024 and the growth in OpEx reflects our execution on hiring in sales and marketing and R&D so far this year. Q2 operating income was $158 million, or a 24% operating margin compared to 27% last quarter and 21% in the year-ago quarter.\nNow turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $164 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $144 million for a free cash flow margin of 22%.\nNow for our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2024. First, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends.\nFor the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $660 million to $664 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $146 million to $150 million, which implies an operating margin of 22% to 23%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.38 to $0.40 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor the fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.63 billion, which represents 23% to 24% year-over growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $620 million to $630 million, which implies an operating margin of 24%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.66 per share based on approximately 360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nSome additional notes to our guidance. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $125 million. Next, we expect to pay cash taxes in the range of $20 million to $25 million and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenues range in fiscal 2024.\nAnd now to conclude. As Oli mentioned, we are pleased with our execution in the first half of 2024, and plan to continue to help our customers observe, secure and act in their modern cloud environments.\nI want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts in this. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nThank you, Marvin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's First Quarter 2024 financial results, which we announced in the press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and DevOps, Datadog's CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution at the start of 2024. First, we have continued to broaden our platform across observability, cloud security, software delivery as well as closing the loop with cloud service management. We also kept supporting our customers' adoption of new technologies including next-gen AI and large language models. And we have continued to add new customers and to see existing customers increase their usage growth and product adoption.\nLet me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance. Revenue was $611 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with about 28,000 customers, up from about 25,500 last year. We had about 3,340 customers, with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,910 last year. These customers generated about 87% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $187 million, with a free cash flow margin of 31%.\nTurning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 82% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 81% a year ago. 47% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 43% a year ago. 23% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 19% a year ago. And 10% of our customers were using 8 or more products, up from 7% last year.\nWe continue to see robust growth in our 3 pillars of observability, infrastructure monitoring, APM and log management. But we also have many younger products that are becoming more meaningful contributors to our business over time. For example, our products outside of infrastructure monitoring, APM suite and log management exceeded $200 million in ARR in Q1. And as a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, Synthetics, [indiscernible] and continuous [indiscernible]. And as we look at the 12 products that we launched between 2020 and 2022, those now contribute about 11% to our ARR. Of those 12 products, 8 are over $10 million in ARR, which is a nice milestone for these relatively new additions. And we are seeing some products grow faster than we initially expected. For example, database monitoring is already 1% of our revenue with strong and growing product penetration across our customer base.\nSo we are very pleased with the progress of our newer products, even though we know we have much further to go with them.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q1, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was higher than in Q4. And this users growth in Q1 was similar to what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2022. As a reminder, that was a period when we started to see a normalization of usage following the accelerated growth we had experienced in 2021. Overall, we saw healthy growth across our product lines. And as usual, our newer products grew at a faster rate from a smaller base.\nWhile some of our customers are continuing to be cost conscious, we are seeing optimization activity reduce in intensity. As an illustration, the optimizing cohort we identified several quarters ago did grow sequentially again this quarter. We also see that customers are adopting more products and increasing usage with us. We think this shows that they are moving forward with their cloud migration and digital transformation plans, and that we are executing on opportunities to consolidate point solutions into our platform.\nAnd finally, churn continues to be low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\nMoving on to R&D. We had another very productive quarter. In the MegaGenAI space, we announced general availability of Bits AI for incident management. By using Bits AI for incident management, incident responders get auto-generated incident summaries to quickly understand the context and scope of a complex incident. And users can also acquire Bits AI to ask about [indiscernible] incident and to form tasks on the fly from incident creation to resolution.\nWe're also continuing to see more interest in AI from our customers. As a data point, ARR for next GenAI customers was about 3.5% of our total, a strong sign of the growing ecosystem of companies in this area.\nTo help customers understand AI technologies and bring them into production applications, our AI integrations allow customers to pull their AI data into the Datadog platform. And today, about 2,000 of our customers are using 1 or more of these AI integrations. And we've continued to keep up with the rapid innovation in this space. For example, adding a new integration in Q1 with the NVIDIA Triton [indiscernible] server.\nIn the cloud service management area, we released event management in the general availability. Our customers face increasing complexity at scale, causing the volume of alerts and events to explode, which makes it difficult for teams to identify, prioritize, summarize and route issue to the right responders. Event management addresses this challenge by automatically reducing a massive volume of events and alerts into actionable sites. These are then used to generate tickets, call an incident or trigger and automated radiation.\nAnd by combining event management with Watchdog, Bits AI and workflow automations, Datadog now provides a full AI solution that helps teams automate remediation, proactively prevent outages and reduce the impact of incidents.\nIn the observability space, our log management product continues to expand in capability. In March, we made error tracking for logs generally available. Error tracking intelligently combines millions of errors from logs into a manageable number of issues for customers. In beyond erro tracking, we are delivering new features to allow our customers to do more with their logs within the Datadog platform, starting with new core capabilities such as enhanced full tech search and support for advanced subqueries, both highly desired by our customers.\nWe also continue to make progress with Flex Logs. As a reminder, Flex Logs allow customers to easily scale storage and compute separately which in turn allows for new, very high-volume use cases in a cost-effective manner. While Flex Logs remains in limited availability, we are seeing a high level of interest from customers, many of whom want to retain logs for long-term purposes such as audit, security and compliance. And we're pleased to see that with only a limited set of customers so far, Flex Logs already exceed $10 million in ARR today.\nIn the digital experience area, we launched mobile app testing in general availability, giving access to fast, no code, reliable testing on mobile devices, which was a big challenge for customers given the wide range of devices and operating systems in use by consumers. And in cloud cost management, we've added full support for Google Cloud, so FinOps and DevOps teams can optimize their cloud spend across their AWS, Azure and GCP footprint. Cloud cost management is another of our newer products that exceeds the $10 million AR milestone, and we believe there's significantly more opportunity for us to have our customers there.\nAs usual, I'd like to thank our product and engineering teams for the quarter, and I'm looking forward to the many announcements we'll make at our [indiscernible] Conference in [indiscernible] in New York.\nNow let's move on to sales and marketing. We've been pleased to once again add some exciting new customers and expand with many more. So let's go through a few examples. First, we signed a 3-year, 7-figure expansion with a leading online grocery business. This customer has used Datadog as their platform of choice for several years now. And as they migrate to Azure, they are looking to ensure reliability and security as they deploy at scale. With this renewal, they are adding cloud security management, application security management and cloud team to enable a shift to a DevSecOps culture in the organization. And this customer expects to add 7 products for a total of 14 across the Datadog platform.\nNext, in 2 deals over the past 6 months, we had a 7-figure expansion with a medical device company. This customer was primarily using our infrastructure monitoring and APM suite, but its legacy logging solution was becoming cost prohibitive, while the lack of correlation across siloed teams was causing frustration and higher times to resolution. With this expansion, the customer plans to add up 9 products and consolidated log management tool as well as 4 other commercial [indiscernible] tools into Datadog.\nNext, we signed a high 6-figure expansion with an athletic apparel company. This company had a [indiscernible] monitoring tools, which wasted time and was impacted operations, revenue and customer experience. With this expansion, the company plans to consolidate out of 4 commercial and open source point solutions. They also expect to spend millions of dollars over the next several years, while providing a great consumer experience.\nNext, we signed a high 6-figure expansion with a European division of 1 of the world's largest car makers. This customer has chosen Datadog as its observability vendor in many business units globally. And in Europe, they currently monitor about 1/4 of their applications with us and are migrating hundreds of applications to fully move to Datadog in the next 2 years. With this expansion, this customer is using [indiscernible] products in the Datadog platform. Next, we signed a 6-year [indiscernible] with a division of a Fortune 500 industrial company. The company is moving its e-commerce application to Google Cloud. They felt [indiscernible] on-prem monitoring tools would not transition well to the cloud and are starting with 3 of our products as they are confident in Datadog's ability to keep innovating in modern cloud and serverless environments.\nFinally, we signed a 6-figure land with 1 of the world's largest communication infrastructure companies. This company started cloud migration a couple of years ago and found itself limited by fragmented tooling and lack of data correlation. In contrast, the Datadog service catalog gives them a single view for performance, ownership, security, SLOs and KPIs, which as customer believes is a unique capability among the vendors it considered and which aligns with their goal of delivering centralized observability across the business. And this customer is adopting 7 Datadog products initially and consolidating out of 4 tools.\nAnd that's it for another productive for our mobile to market teams.\nLet me now say a few words on our longer-term outlook. Overall, we continue to see no change in the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We are seeing improved usage growth with less impact from optimization than we had seen in the last few quarters. For those customers who are remaining cost focused, we are very happy to help them get value from their observability solutions and consolidate into the Datadog platform to achieve time and cost savings.\nMeanwhile, we are seeing continued experimentation with new technologies, including a growing adoption of AI, which we believe will be an accelerator of technical innovation and cloud migration over time. And we're working every day to innovate and help our customers adopt new technologies with confidence and become better businesses in the process.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. Q1 revenue was $611 million, up 27% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance, first, regarding usage growth, in Q1, we saw sequential usage growth from existing customers that was higher than the usage growth in Q4. Q1's usage growth was similar to what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2022. [indiscernible] during Q1, we experienced a lead pattern that was very typical for us, which included [indiscernible] growth in March that was higher than January and February. Regarding usage growth by customer size in Q1, we saw usage growth accelerate across our larger customers, those with $100,000 of annual spend or higher.\nAnd we saw particularly strong usage growth with our largest customers who spend multiple million dollars with us annually. Geographically, we experienced stronger year-over-year revenue growth in international markets than in North America. And finally, for our retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention was in the mid-100s in Q1 -- sorry, in the mid-110s in Q1, similar to last quarter. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid- to high 90s.\nNow moving on to our financial results. Billings were $618 million, up 21% year-over-year. Billings duration increased year-over-year. Sequential billings growth was seasonally lower as it was in Q1 2023. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.73 billion, up 52% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the low 40% growth year-over-year. RPO duration increased year-over-year, but was down quarter-over-quarter as we saw fewer multiyear deals relative to last quarter.\nIn general, we are continuing to see an increasing interest with our larger customers in multiyear commitments, which results in longer RPO duration in both total and current RPO. As a reminder, our RPO has been and continues to be lumpy, an effect that may be amplified as our customers move towards multiyear deals.\nWe continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nFirst, gross profit in the quarter was $509 million, representing a gross margin of 83.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 83.4% last quarter and 80.5% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency projects.\nOur Q1 OpEx grew 14% year-over-year and increased from 10% year-over-year growth last quarter. As discussed last quarter, we intend to invest in headcount in 2024, and we have accelerated hiring in sales and marketing and R&D to execute on our growth plans.\nQ1 operating income was $164 million or a 27% operating margin compared to 28% last quarter and 18% in the year-ago quarter.\nAnd now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $212 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $187 million for a free cash flow margin of 31%.\nNow for our outlook for the second quarter and the fiscal year 2024. Our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends. So for the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $620 million to $624 million, which represents a 22% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $134 million to $138 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. In Q2, we will be holding our DASH User Conference, which we estimate to cost about $11 million. Our operating income guidance reflects this event.\nNon-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36 per share based on approximately $360 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.61 billion, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $585 million to $605 million, which implies an operating margin of 23%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.57 per share based on approximately 361 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nNow for some additional notes on our guidance. First, we expect net interest income and other income together for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $110 million. Next, we expect cash taxes in 2024 to be in the $20 million to $25 million range, and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 and going forward.\nAnd finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 3% to 4% of revenues in fiscal 2024.\nTo summarize, we are pleased with how we started 2024. And I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts. And now with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2023 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Yuka Broderick.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nThank you, Carmen. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's fourth quarter 2023 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2024 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.\nWe will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had a good Q4 to end what has been a very productive year to 2023. Throughout the year, we kept innovating at a fast pace, going broader and deeper into the problems we solve for our customers. We also continue to add new customers and expand with existing ones, driving both usage growth and adoption of new products. But most of all, I'm very pleased that we mobilize as a company to help our customers get through a -- environment.\nWe help our customers make more -- use of their cloud and observability leaving them in a better position at the end of the year from which they can focus again on growing their businesses and migrating to the cloud.\nNow let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. Revenue was $590 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 27,300 customers up from about 23,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 3,190 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,780 last year. These customers generated about 86% of our ARR. We had 396 customers with an ARR of $1 million or more compared to the $317 million we had at the end of last year. And we generated free cash flow of $201 million, with a free cash flow margin of 34%.\nTurning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 83% of customers were using two or more products, up from 81% a year ago. 47% of customers were using four or more products, up from 42% a year ago. 22% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 18% a year ago. And as a sign of continued penetration of our platform, 9% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 6% a year ago. And our success with cross product adoption isn't limited to core observability as our newer products continue to gain traction. Note for example, that the ARR for products outside of infrastructure monitoring, APM suite and log management grew by more than 75% year-over-year. As a reminder, within the APM suite, we include core APM, synthetics, RAM and continuous profiler.\nDuring 2023, we continue to land and expand with larger customers. As of December 2023, 42% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 37% last year. We think many of the largest enterprises are still very early in their journey to the cloud. The median Datadog ARR for Fortune 500 customers is still less than $0.5 million, which leaves a very large opportunity for us to grow with these customers.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business levers. In Q4, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was similar to Q3. Our usage growth during the quarter paid out roughly as expected, including a strong start in October and the slowdown we typically see at the end of December. We also note that the greater intensity of optimization we've seen over the past 6 quarters appears to have dissipated. For the last couple of quarters, we have discussed with you a cohort of customers who are optimizing. In Q4, this core usage grew at a faster pace than the broader customer is. We take this as a positive sign.\nTo be clear, we see optimization activity with our customers every quarter. We expect them to continuously make sure they are using their cloud efficiently, and we'll keep helping them do that. And we do still see attention to costs in certain parts of our customer base. But overall, we see less headwinds than we did a few quarters ago.\nMeanwhile, we had a strong book quarter in Q4. Our go-to-market teams delivered our largest annualized bookings since Q1 of '22. And our enterprise team, in particular, executed on a record amount of annualized bookings in Q4. We are also seeing more customers enter into multiyear deals with us, which speaks to a deepening relationships with them as well as customers planning for growth and for the longer term after a period of optimization and uncertainty. As a reminder, our bookings don't translate immediately into revenue growth, but it is an indicator that we continue to serve our new and existing as well, and they are growing with us over time.\nFinally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\nMoving on to R&D. We released over 400 new features and capabilities during 2023. Of course, that's too much for us to our cover today. But let me speak to a few. In observability, we now have more than 700 integrations allowing our customers to benefit from the latest AWS, Azure and GCP abilities as well as from the newly emerging AI stack. We continue to see increasing engagement there with the use of our next-gen AI integrations growing 75% sequentially in Q4.\nIn the generative AI and -- space, we continue to add capability to beef AI or natural language incident management copilot. And we are advancing AI mobility to help customers investigate where they can safely deploy and manage their models in production. Today, about 3% of our ARR comes from next-gen AI native customers, but we believe the opportunity is far larger in the future as customers of every industry and every size start doing AI functionality in production.\nIn the APM space, we launched data streams monitoring to monitor queuing, streaming and event-driven pipelines, which is a technically challenging type of workloads APM products have historically struggled to cover. We also rolled out single-step APM onboarding, allowing a single engineer to enable APM across complex applications in minutes. And with dynamic instrumentation, engineers can add logs, metrics and traces to the application on the fly without co-changes or redeployments.\nIn the digital experience area, we've added heat maps and scroll maps to our reuser monitoring product to show developer and product owners what their users are actually seeing. And our customers can now create synthetic test directly from session replay for which we have received very positive feedback.\nAnd in log management, we continue to expand our capabilities. Starting with Flex Logs, customers can have a very cost-effective way to retain their logs at a very large scale. With air tracking for logs, customers can quickly cut down millions of airlines into a handful of actionable summaries. And our log pipeline scanner allows customers to inspect log events in near real time, building greater visibility into data quality and data governance.\nIn cloud service management, we made workflow automation generally available enabling customers to easily automate and orchestrate processes across operations and security. And today, we are announcing the general availability of case management to provide engineers with a single view for investigations, ticketing to do items, tasks and follow-ups across the -- platform.\nMoving on to cloud security. We kept executing against an ambitious road map and are pleased to now count over 6,000 customers using one or more Datadog security products. This month, we launched software composition analysis to enable our customers to proactively detect and remediate vulnerability before the code gets to production. We announced cloud infrastructure entitlement management to have customers prevent identity and access management security issues.\nWe shipped cloud SIEM investigator, so customers can conduct deep security investigation using logs over long periods of time. We simplified security operations with our security inbox to allow customers to -- security issues into one single list to investigate media, and we also expanded our data security capabilities. Sensitive data scanner now finding secrets and sensitive data in traces and relevance in relation to logs.\nIn software delivery, we launched Intelligent Test Runner, which dramatically accelerates the testing process in CICD. And we ship code-quality and security gate to enforce best practices, catch security vulnerabilities and prevent -- tests.\nAnd last, but not least, we delivered on a number of platform-wide initiatives. We launched our latest data center in Japan to have customers comply with local data private laws. We opened up cost create throughout our platform for collaboration in response -- programming and data login. We extended cloud cost management, which is now GA for Azure and will soon be for to GCP to offer a comprehensive view of costs across our customers' cloud footprint. And we announced our intent to achieve -- high and Impact Level 5 authorizations.\nSo I'd like to thank our product and engineering team for a very productive 2023. And I'm super excited we will have planned for 2024.\nLet's go on to sales and marketing. First of all, I'd like to welcome [ Sara Varni ] to the team as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Sara brings more than 15 years of marketing experience centered around developers and enterprise software. And we really look forward to her leadership in this pivotal role.\nAs I said earlier, we had a very strong close to 2023 with record levels of bookings and some very exciting new logos and expansions. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed a 3-year expansion and offers ever [ nine-figure ] TCV deal with a major global fintech company. This expansion brings us into a major new business unit that we were not deployed in before. And this time, the customer focused on bringing end-to-end observability to their mobile applications, and they focus, in particular, on being in front of any user impacting issues to the use of our release monitoring product. With this renewal, this customer expects to use 15 Datadog products, and we'll consolidate what used to be 10 separate tools, including the replacement of 3 commercial products across infrastructure monitoring, APM and RAM.\nNext, we signed a seven figure expansion with one of the world's largest restaurant chains. These customer is using AWS Azure, GCP and Oracle Cloud, and they believe Datadog is the only platform that can deliver a consistent experience across all four clouds. With this expansion, the customer plans to deploy Datadog for cloud service management use cases and will expand to a total of 10 Datadog products.\nNext, we signed an eight-figure multiyear expansion with a leading European financial services company. This customer is undergoing a large-scale migration to Azure and will expand its use of Datadog across on-prem, private and public cloud. Today, Datadog is used by 3,000 users a month in over 400 teams to monitor 13,000 hosts. With the migration, the Datadog platform usage will expand to more than 1,000 teams and 50,000 hosts. This customer plans to use 14 Datadog products and consolidate more than 10 legacy open source and -- tools.\nNext, we signed a seven-figure -- with one of the world's largest food and consumer goods company. This customer wants to be more proactive with risk mitigation and system resilience as they migrate to Azure. They also want to reduce the thousands of hours of engineering time they spent every year in -- This customer brought in Datadog to be the observative foundation of the AOP strategy, in particular, using Watch Dog or incident management capabilities. This new land includes 17 Datadog products. And the customer expects to consolidate at least six commercial observability tools.\nFinally, we signed a six-figure land deal with one of the largest U.S. utilities. This customer is rearchitecturing its customer-facing website and replatforming its customer support experience. They identified Datadog as the only platform that could still integrate end-to-end with their existing sales, customer experience and workflows. Expect to start with six Datadog products, and they will displace two commercial observability tools in the process.\nAnd that's it for this quarter's highlights. Thanks again, to our go-to-market team for their great work in 2023, an excellent close of the year and ambitious plans for 2024.\nBefore I turn it over to David for a financial review, a few words on our longer-term outlook. During 2023, we continue to execute on our product innovation plans, and we solve more problems and delivered more value to customers. As we enter 2024, it appears that the worst of cloud optimization may be behind us.\nWe continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business and critical motion for every company to deliver value and competitive advantage. We see AI adoption as an additional driver of investment and accelerator of technical innovation and cloud migration. And more than ever, we feel ideally positioned to achieve our goals and help customers of every size in every industry to transform, innovate and drive value to technology adoption.\nWith that, I will turn it over to David.\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. Q4 revenue was $590 million, up 26% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of this Q4 performance, first, regarding usage growth. Overall, we saw usage growth from existing customers in Q4 that was similar to what we saw in Q3. Last quarter, we mentioned that the larger and more intense optimizers had begun to show signs of stabilization. In Q4, we saw those trends continue and the large optimizers begin to grow again.\nWhile we may still be in a cost-conscious environment overall, we believe that the higher intensity of optimization has dissipated and clients are continuing to invest in new digital applications.\nFor the first time in 6 quarters, our sequential ARR adds in Q4 were higher than in the year-ago quarter. As we look at early data for Q1, January usage growth was solid. The rebound we're seeing from the slower end of December is better than what we experienced last January. We -- always that it's too early to know how the quarter will play out, and we would caution investors from extrapolating too much but we're encouraged by the near-term trend.\nRegarding usage growth by customer size, we experienced our highest growth in our largest and smaller spending customers in this quarter. This includes a record increase in sequential ARR added from customers who spend $1 million or more annually with us and an expansion of 1 million plus customers from 317 to 396 over 2023.\nIn terms of new logos, our customer additions on a gross and net basis, as well as on a new dollar -- a new logo dollar basis were similar to that of Q3. As before, our net adds included slightly elevated churn in our very long tail of small customers, many of whom are self-service.\nGeographically, we experienced stronger year-over-year revenue growth in international markets in North America. Our international markets represented 31% of our revenue in Q4 2023, up from 28% in Q4 of last year.\nFinally, for our retention metrics. Our trailing 12-month net revenue retention was in the mid-110s in Q4. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid- to high 90s. And our dollar churn is low and declined sequentially.\nNow moving on to our financial results. Billings were $723 million, up 35% year-over-year. Billings duration increased year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.84 billion, up 74% year-over-year. Current RPR growth was in the mid-40s percent year-over-year.\nWe are continuing to see an increasing interest with our larger customers in multiyear commitments, which results in longer RPO duration in both total and current RPO. We welcome the opportunity to have these longer-term strategic partnerships with our clients. And we see that once customers are farther along in their optimizations, they feel comfortable committing over longer periods of time in the future.\nAs we said before, we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some of our key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nFirst, gross profit in the quarter was $492 million, representing a gross margin of 83.4%. This compares to a gross margin of 82.3% last quarter and 80.6% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency products -- projects.\nOur Q4 OpEx grew 10% year-over-year, a decline from 17% year-over-year growth last quarter. As we discussed last quarter, while making meaningful investments in 2023, we were more cautious than in previous years given the macro condition and focused more on efficiency and optimization. We believe this will put us in a good position to accelerate investment in 2024 while maintaining margin discipline.\nQ4 operating income was $167 million, or a 28% operating margin, up from 24% last quarter and 18% in the year-ago quarter. As with last quarter, our margins ended up being higher than we expected in Q4 as we executed well on our internal optimization and cost management efforts.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter at $2.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $220 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $201 million with a free cash flow margin of 34%.\nNow for our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2024. Our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends.\nFor the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $591 million, which represents a 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $128 million to $132 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.33 to $0.35 per share based on approximately 35 -- 357 million of average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.555 billion to $2.575 billion, which represents 21% -- 20% to 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $535 million to $555 million, which implies an operating margin of 21% to 22% and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.44 per share based on 361 million average shares diluted outstanding.\nSome additional notes on guidance as it relates to our growth in OpEx and hiring. As I mentioned earlier, we took a more cautious attitude towards hiring during 2023. And our headcount ended fiscal 2023 at about 5,200 people growing in the high single digits year-over-year. We remain excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities. And as a result, our operating profit guidance reflects our intent to invest for future growth in 2024.\nWe intend to accelerate hiring in R&D to execute on our long-term growth opportunities and in sales and marketing to reach customers worldwide. Because of that, our operating profit guidance implies operating expense growth in the mid-20% range year-over-year, with operating expense year-over-year growth ramping throughout 2024 as we execute on our hiring plans. Meanwhile, we will continue to balance our investments in long-term growth with financial discipline as we have executed in the past.\nNow turning to other areas of the P&L. First, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Regarding taxes, while we expect to continue to be a modest cash payer in 2024, estimated to be $20 million to $25 million, we are establishing a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal year 2024 and going forward. And this is reflected in our non-GAAP net income per share guidance.\nWe have recasted our fiscal 2022 and '23 non-GAAP net income to reflect this non-GAAP tax rate, and that is available in the tables in our earnings release as well as the financial supplemental. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range in fiscal year 2024.\nNow to summarize. We are pleased with our execution in 2023. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys. And we plan to innovate further and expand the set of problems we solve for our customers in 2024 and beyond. I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in 2023, and I'm excited about our plans in 2024.\nFinally, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Investor Day this Thursday in New York City. Please go to the Datadog IR website for the live stream or contact the IR team at ir@datadoghq.com to attend in person.\nAnd with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution in Q3. We delivered another quarter of profitable growth and robust notable bookings and we continue to broaden our platform to have customers become and grow digital businesses.\nLet me start with a review of our Q3 financial performance. Revenue was $548 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 26,800 customers, up from about 22,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 3,130 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,600 last year. And these customers generated about 86% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $138 million with a free cash flow margin of 25%.\nTurning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q3, 82% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 80% a year ago. 46% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 40% a year ago and 21% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 16% last year.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q3, we saw usage growth we've seen customers improve compared to Q2. Overall growth in Q3 was relatively consistent throughout the quarter and comparable to levels we've seen in Q1. We are seeing signs that the cloud optimization activity from some of our customers may be moderating. As a reminder, last quarter, we discussed a cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago and we said that they appear to stabilize their users growth at the end of Q2. That trend has held for the past several months with that cohorts usage remaining stable throughout Q3.\nOverall, we continue to see impact from optimization in our business. But we believe that the intensity and breadth of optimization we've experienced in recent quarters is moderating. Meanwhile, our new logo activity has remained robust. New logo bookings continue to scale and grow year-over-year. And for the second quarter in a row, we closed a record number of new deals with more than $100,000 in annual commitment.\nWith our Aladdin expand model, we expect new logos to turn into much larger customers over time as they lead into the cloud and add up more and more products. Finally, regarding customer growth, we are pleased with the new logos, new workloads and new product attaches we added this quarter. We added a number of exciting new customized in Q3, and I'll discuss a couple of examples later.\nNote that our total customer count is largely driven by our long tail of very small customers, while our sales motions are more targeted to the middle and high end of our prospects. And as a reflection of our team's strong execution, our net adds of customers over $100,000, saw an increase in Q3 compared to Q2.\nDespite a more cost-conscious demand environment over the past year, our business has continued to grow across product lines and we are very proud to achieve several key milestones. First, our infrastructure monitoring ARR exceeded $1 billion. Today, on [indiscernible] products cover monitoring the performance of hosts, networks, containers, Kubernetes deployments, saves functions and other aspects of infrastructure in the cloud as well as a full set of AI and machine learning tools to help our customers separate signal for noise.\nSecond, our APM suite, which includes core APM, Synthetics reuser monitoring and continuous profiler, exceeded $500 million in ARR, and we continue to expand our capabilities in APM, most recently with single-site instrumentation, which allows a single engineer to enable APM across all applications without co-changes and we ship advances in mobile app monitoring, including mobile application testing and mobilization replay.\nThird, our log management product exceeded $500 million in AR. We also continue to expand our capabilities in load management. And with Flex logs, customers can easily scale storage and compute separately, allowing for new very high-volume logging use cases in a cost-effective manner.\nFrom the very beginning, my cofounder Alex and I had a vision to create a unified platform that serves end-to-end use cases across datasets, products and SIM boundaries. We believe that these ARR milestones and their balance across the 3 pillars of observability demonstrate that Datadog is unique within the industry in establishing true platform value for customers. And of course, even though these products have become significant in size, we are only just getting started. We will continue to innovate to deliver more solutions for our customers across sustainability and beyond.\nI will add that we have empathy for our customers in the print points, in part because we are ourselves users of cloud and next-gen technologies at a meaningful scale and we extensively deploy a user on solution, which is appropriately known as dog footing. As an example, we have extensively relied on our cloud cost management product as we expanded its capabilities this past year.\nAnd the use of our product has played a large role in delivering cost performance and efficiency improvements, optimizing our own cloud usage and ultimately resulting in expansion of our gross margins in recent quarters.\nWe also continued to innovate in the depth take-up space. Our recent expansions in cloud security include cloud see investigator, where customers can visualize logs over a long period of time to conduct security investigations. And within our Cloud Security Management product, we have introduced Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management, or CEM, to help customers prevent identity and access management security issues.\nFor a few years now, the industry has been talking about the idea of DevSecOps, the breaking down of silos among development, operations and security teams. And we entered the security space on the premise that DevOps and security teams should share the same data in the same platform.\nSo starting this month, we are making the practice of DevSecOps easy to adopt for all customers by bringing together all the components needed to fully monitor and secure their entire stack with 2 simple packages. First, with infrastructure DevSecOps, our customers can observe and secure their entire cloud environment in 1 package. With a simple purpose price and a single agent deployed, customers get end-to-end visibility into performance, availability and security issues in one place. And from that one place, teams can also quickly remediate problems using built-in workflows and without any code or contribution changes.\nSecond, with APM DevSecOps, we take this one step further. Customers can instrument cloud applications for both performance and generality issues in one single package enabled with the same unified agent used for infrastructure DevSecOps. APM DevSecOps complements infrastructure DevSecOps by surfacing open source and code level security viabilities alongside performance issue.\nFinally, we continue to be excited about the opportunity in generative AI and large language models. First, we believe adopting NextGen AI will require the use of cloud and other modern technologies and drive additional growth in cloud workloads. So we are continuing to invest by integrating with more components at every layer of the new AI stack and by developing our own LLM observability products.\nAnd while we see signs of AI adoption across large parts of our customer base, in the near term, we continue to see AI-related usage manifest itself most accurately with next-gen AI native customers who contributed about 2.5% of our ARR this quarter.\nIn the mid- to long term, we expect customers of all industries and sizes to keep adding value to their products using AI and to get their early explore to get from early exploration to develop mine into production, thus driving larger cloud and observability usage across our customer base.\nBesides observing the AI stack, we also expect to keep adding value to our own platform using AI. Datadog's unified platform and purely SaaS model, combined with strong multiproduct adoption by our customers generates a large amount of deep and precise doability data. We believe combining AI capabilities with this broad data set will allow us to deliver differentiated value to customers.\nAnd we are working to product that is differentiated value through recently announced capabilities such as our bid Bits AI assistant, AI generated synthetic test and AI-led air analysis and resolution, and we expect to deliver many more related innovation to customers over time.\nLet's move on to sales and marketing, where we continue to execute on both new logos and existing customers. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we founded 7-figure land over 5 years with a leading provider of dental care. This company's legacy monitoring just didn't cut and it contributed to delay with their migration to Azure.\nWhat's concerning to them was that customers notice poor application performance and were complaining publicly on social media. By adopting 6 Datadog products, they expect to find and fix the vast majority of incidents internally before their customers are affected. And in signing a 5-year deal, this customer showed its confidence in Datadog as a long-term partner in their migration.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure land with a South American fintech company. By moving from basic built-in cloud monitoring, legacy tooling and open source tools to Datadog, this customer expects to significantly reduce costs by spending less on tooling, reducing time to resolution and giving time back to engineers to innovate on their own products.\nNext, we signed an 8-figure [indiscernible] over 3 years with a major American chain of convenience stores. With this expansion, Datadog will bring all aspects of these customers' tech systems into one platform, including their applications, hybrid cloud, network, in-store IoT technology, point-of-sale systems, self-serve kiosks, fuel pumps and corporate infrastructure.\nThis will free up employee time to focus on customer service with expectations to save millions of dollars annually. This customer plans to use 6 Parador products replacing 3 commercial liability tools. Next, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a major U.S. federal agency.\nWhen we first started working with this customer a year ago, Datadog was approved for a limited subset of programs. But as we have demonstrated value and gain eternal adoption, this customer is now deploying Datadog across the entire agency. They have a date 6 Datadog products, and by doing so, consolidated out of 7 tools.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a Fortune 500 industrial company. Customer was concerned with out-of-control costs with its legacy log management products and was using a dozen different tools. And when they began using Datadog, they noticed far fewer support tickets submitted to their reliability team. By growing set with Datadog and expanding to 7 products, this customer expects to deliver better service while saving time and reducing cost.\nAnd last, we signed a 7-figure expansion with a software business that is part of a tech hyperscaler. This long-term customer has used Datadog for infrastruction metrics and will now expand to adopt 7 Datadog product. Datadog will be replacing its commercial APM tool, which was well adopted by its engineers and led to inefficient shooting outages and revenue impact.\nOur support of open telemetry, in particular, was key to their decision to expand with Datadog that it makes it possible for APM tracing to be democratized and use across their entire DevOps team. And that's it for this quarter's highlights. I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their strong execution in Q3.\nBefore I turn it over to David for a financial review, let me reiterate our longer-term outlook. As we have said throughout this period of cloud optimization and macro uncertainty, our long-term plans have remained unchanged. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business and critical motions for every company to deliver value and competitive advantage.\nSo we continue to invest aggressively to burden our platform, and we aim to be our customers' mission-critical partners as they move to cloud and to modern DevSecOps. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, David.\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. Q3 revenue was $548 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of this Q3 performance, first, regarding usage growth. We saw an improvement in usage growth in Q3 versus Q2. The Q3 usage growth was more similar to Q1 and relatively steady throughout the quarter.\nWe had a very healthy start to Q4 in October. While it is too early in the quarter to know for sure, it will happen in the next couple of months, the trends we see in early Q4 are stronger than they've been for the past year. Regarding usage growth by customer size, we continue to see larger spending customer growth at a slower rate than smaller spending customers, but usage growth improved for all customer sizes in Q3 relative to Q2.\nAnd as Olivier discussed, we believe there are signs that the optimization activity we've been seeing is moderating. Last quarter, we discussed the cohort of customers who started optimizing about a year ago. This cohort's usage has been stable -- was stable throughout Q3. As we look at our overall customer activity, we continue to see customers optimizing but with less impact than we experienced in Q2, contributing to our usage growth with existing customers improving in Q3 relative to Q2.\nWhile we expect cost management to continue, we believe we are seeing moderation that is still present but -- a moderation is still present, but is less intense and less widespread than we experienced in recent quarters. Geographically, we experienced similar sequential revenue growth in North America and in our international markets. And finally, as regard to retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention was in line with our expectations and came in slightly below 120% in Q3. Our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continues to be stable in the mid- to high 90s, a sign of the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.\nMoving on to our financial results. Billings were $607 million, up 30% year-over-year. Billings duration increased slightly year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.45 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was about 30% year-over-year.\nOver the past couple of quarters, we have seen an increasing preference from our customers to sign multiyear deals, and our weighted average booking duration was up sequentially and year-over-year. We see continued interest in multiyear duration deals in our pipeline as customers seek longer-term strategic partnerships with us.\nWe continue to believe that revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenues based on the timing of invoice and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $451 million, representing a gross margin of 82.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 81.3% last quarter and 79.7% in the year ago quarter.\nAs Olivier mentioned, we continued to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold in the quarter as our engineering teams pursue cost savings and efficiency projects. Our Q3 OpEx grew 17% year-over-year. This is a decline from 26% year-over-year growth last quarter. We continued to execute on controlling costs given the uncertain environment. And Q3 operating income was $131 million for a 24% operating margin, up from 21% last quarter and above the 17% in the year ago quarter.\nOur margins were higher than we expected in Q3 as our organic growth was higher than in Q2, while our internal optimization and cost management efforts were successful. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash flow from operations was $153 million in the quarter.\nAfter taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $138 million for a free cash flow margin of 25%. And now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2023. A reminder, our guidance philosophy remains unchanged. We based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism on these growth trends.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $564 million to $568 million, which represents about 20% to 21% growth year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $129 million to $133 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.42 to $0.44 per share based on approximately 355 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor fiscal year 2023, we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.103 billion to $2.107 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $453 million to $457 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.52 to $1.54 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nSome additional notes for our guidance. First, we expect net interest income and net interest and other income for fiscal 2023 to be approximately $95 million. We expect tax expense in the fiscal year to be $12 million to $14 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range in fiscal 2023.\nAnd now regarding 2024. It is too early for us to speak to 2024 revenue growth. We will digest the information we see over the next couple of months and give you our 2024 revenue guidance next quarter. As it relates to non-GAAP profitability, our operating income and margins were a little higher in Q3 than we targeted as usage growth improved from Q2 levels, and we were successful with our cost efficiencies.\nWe expect continued strong execution on profitability in Q4. At the same time, we continue to be excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities and we have no shortage of investments to make and are confident in our ability to execute to strong ROI on those investments.\nAs a result, while we are not providing 2024 margin guidance at this point, as always, we will balance our investments in long-term growth with margin discipline. And we will update you on that in more detail next quarter. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

Welcome to the Q2 2023 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nThank you, Gigi. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's second quarter 2023 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2023 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and usage optimization trends. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.\nwill also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our team continued to execute well in Q2 as we welcome thousands of attendees at our Dashes conference last week. We continue to deliver a large number of new product innovations and we recorded strong new logo bookings throughout the quarter.\nLet me start with a review of our Q2 financial performance. Revenue was $509 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 26,100 customers, up from about 21,200 last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,990 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,420 last year. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR and we generated free cash flow of $142 million, with a free cash flow margin of 28%.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. At a high level, first, we saw Q2 usage growth for existing customers that was a bit lower than it had been in previous quarters. Second, we do see signs that cloud optimization may start to subside. And third, we continue scaling our sales with strong new logo bookings in Q2. Going 1 level deeper.\nIn Q2, we saw U.S. growth for existing customers that was a bit lower than it had been in previous quarters. We continue to see customers, particularly some larger spending customers, scrutinize costs and optimize their cloud and observability usage during Q2. We are reflecting this lower growth in our updated guidance for 2023, and David will provide more commentary regarding our guidance geography.\nOn the other hand, we are seeing signs that the cloud optimization across our customer base may start to subside. The cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago appear to have stabilized the users growth at the end of Q2, as indicated by the recent activity and the related commitments with us. And we saw usage growth in aggregates rebound in July to levels that are more similar to what we see in Q1.\nWhile it is too early to call an end to cloud optimization and a significant level of macro uncertainty remains, these new trends, along with the tenor of our customer interactions are encouraging.\nLastly, our bookings were strong in Q2. Our new logo and new product bookings and deal cycles haven't been impacted by the period of card optimization and we continue to see healthy growth on the sales side. From a new logo bookings perspective, we had our largest Q2 and second largest quarter ever, only behind the seasonally larger Q4 2022.\nWe also closed a record number of new business deals larger than $100,000 in annual commitment. And with our land extend model, we expect new logos to turn into much larger customers over time as they lead into the cloud, and add up more of our product. So as a conclusion, while we do apply conservatism to our guidance, recent usage trends as well as strong logo activity and customer ramp-ups are positive signs for our future growth.\nNow turning to platform adoption. Q2 metrics show that our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 82% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 79% a year ago. 45% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 37% a year ago and 21% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 14% a year ago.\nThis strong multiproduct adoption include expansion into our new U.S. products. About 30% of our customers have already adopted at least one of our products launched since 2021, including CI visibility database monitoring, cloud security management, sensitive data scanner, cloud craft and others. We expect more opportunities to expand adoption of these products as we continue to broaden their capabilities over time.\nIn Securities, we mentioned last quarter that over 5,000 customers have adopted security products. While many of these 5,000 are just getting started with Datadog Security, we are seeing opportunities to help customers secure their cloud at scale. As of Q2, 79 of our customers spent more than $100,000 on Datadog Security and a handful are now spending more than $1 million.\nNow let's move on to R&D. Last week, we had our Dash Conference and introduced a number of exciting new products and features for our users. To kick off our keynote, we launched our first innovation for generative AI and large language model. We showcased our NLM observability product, enabling ML engineers to safely deploy and manage the morale production. This includes the motor catalog centralized place to view and manage every model in every state of our customer development pipeline; analysis and insight on model performance, which allows all engineers to identify and address performance and quality issue with the model themselves; and help identify model drift, the performance the performance degradation that happens over time as model interact with the world data.\nWe also introduced Bits AI. Bits understands natural language and provide insights from across the Datadog platform as well as from our customers' collaboration and documentation tools. Among its many features, Bits AI can act as an incident management copilot identifying and suggesting succes, generating synthetic tests and triggering workflows to automatically remediate critical issue.\nAnd we announced 15 new integrations across the next-generation AI stack from GPU infrastructure providers to Vector databases, motor vendors and orchestration frameworks. As we said last quarter, we are excited about these new AI technologies, and we believe Datadog is uniquely positioned to both help our customers make the best of them as well as to incorporate them into our product alongside our data and workloads.\nAnd although it's early days for everyone in this space, we are getting traction with AI customers. And in Q2, our next-gen AI customers contributed about 2% of ARR. Moving on from we showcased a number of new capabilities in the observability space. We introduced Flex logs for log management, allowing customers to flexibly choose retention periods and inquiry performance separately to make new high-volume million use cases cost-effective.\nWe are simplifying APM onboarding for large organizations, so engineers can enable APM across all applications without any core changes. With APM trade squaring, our customers can now understand the complete impact of any localized issue. We introduced our air tracking assistant, which marries AI capabilities with live observability data to automatically explain solve and test for production errors.\nIn digital experience, we're also applying next-gen AI technologies to help customers automatically generate synthetic tests from their live traffic data. And we have expanded our mobile monitoring features bringing a first-class experience for mobile developer teams with mobile session replay and mobile application testing. We also announced several innovations in cloud security.\nOur new security inbox surfaces the most pressing security issues, correlating thousands of technical insights and reducing them to a smaller number of actionable tasks. We can now detect more infrastructure abilities, whether they are in applications, container made or hosts. With custom code venerability detection, we extended our detection capabilities beyond arts libraries and into customers on code identifying the exact venerable contact with the mediation detail.\nAnd with Cloud Sim investigator, our customers can visually map an attacker's behavior going back more than a year, leading to faster investigation and remediation. Shifting left, we're delivering more solutions to developers with static analysis. Customers can scan code for quality issues directly within Datadog and we are you seeing quality gates for engineers can set rules and prevent you secure buggy or slow code from deploying production.\nFinally, we announced new capabilities to help customers spend on clad resources more efficiently. Our container resource utilization functionality makes it clear which applications are under or over provisioned. And with cloud cost recommendations, we're adding to our cloud cost management product to automatically discover saving opportunities and act on them. Those were just some of the many announcements we made at Dash. Our Investor Relations website includes a link to the Dash keynote, and I encourage you to watch it to learn more.\nBefore I step away from more innovation, I'm also pleased to note that for the third year in a row, Datadog has been named the leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and observability. We believe this validates our approach to deliver unique platform, which Brexon silos across teams and to focus intensely on product innovation.\nNow let's move on to sales and marketing. As I said earlier, we recorded strong new logo bookings, and we continue to see significant expansion opportunities with existing customers. So let's discuss some of our wins. First, we signed an 8-figure deal over 3 years with a major American video games company.\nThese customers' previous SaaS observability vendor was not delivering on critical capabilities such as coated alerting and collaborative incident management and a recent pricing change motivated to Kistner considerate vendors. By moving to Datadog, this customer expects to get higher value out of their monitoring, reduce allocated and eliminate silos among users.\nAnd as we achieve better results, they expect to save over $1 million annually by shifting to Datadog from their previous vendor. Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a major broadcaster. This customer is moving to AWS and serverless and its fragmented legacy and prints tools meant longer in et resolution times and confusion among teams.\nThis customer is adopting 7 Datadog products, consolidating 5 tools and has already ramped Panado to over 500 users. Next, we signed a 7-figure land with a leading Japanese toys and media company. This company has been using a competitive [indiscernible] vendor alongside smaller tools and homegrown capabilities. With the adoption of 5 Datadog products, they have full visibility into their applications. They can save time on real value busy work and focus on delivering great experiences for their customers.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure expansion with 1 of the world's largest tech companies. This customer is seeing massive adoption of its new generative AI product and needs to scale their GPU fleet to meet increasing demand for a workload. Using their homegrown tools were slowing them down and put at risk critical product launches.\nWith Datadog, this team is able to programmatically manage new environments as they come online, track and alert on their service level objectives and provide real-time visibility for GPs. Last but not least, we stand an expansion with 1 of the world's largest financial institutions, taking this customer to secure ARR.\nThis customer operates at massive scale, supporting thousands of applications run by tens of thousands of developers, and we have a strategic initiative to move aggressively to the public cloud this year. They chose Datadog as their preferred observability platform for cloud application. And as their business units modernize, they are expanding to 10 Datadog products and replacing a number of legacy commercial tools. And that is for this quarter's highlights.\nI'd like to thank our go-to-market team for their execution in Q2 and for helping our customers make the most out of Dash last week. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, let me speak to our longer-term outlook. Despite the recent trends of sell optimization and continued macro uncertainty, our posture remains the same. We are confident in our long-term growth opportunities, driven by the secular trends of cloud migration and digital transformation as well as a rapid pace of innovation to set customers in observability and beyond.\nAnd we think our strong new logo and product adoption trends this quarter are indicative of the continued large and growing opportunity for Teladoc. So our long-term plans have not changed. We are continuing to invest to serve our customers as they move to the cloud, AI and other modern technologies. With that, let me turn it over to our CFO. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nChief Financial Officer, MSCI, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. Q2 revenues was $509 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. In Q2, we continued to execute solidly and we also continue to see pressure on the usage growth of existing customers.\nTo dive into some of the drivers of Q2 performance. First, as to usage growth of existing customers, we saw positive usage growth this quarter to lower than in recent quarters, with broadly similar trends across our product lines. While too early to draw broad conclusions, existing customer usage growth improved in July and was more similar to Q1 than that of Q2.\nWe saw more pressure on cloud native businesses than traditional enterprise customers, similar to previous quarters. Regarding customers by spending size, the more moderate growth trends were consistent across the customer base with relatively more pressure on usage growth rates with larger customers.\nAs Olivier discussed, the cohort of customers who began optimizing about a year ago, appear to have stabilized their usage growth with Datadog, though we recognize that the growth rates of these optimizing customers may remain muted and other customers could optimize. Regarding total customers. Our customer count increased to 26,100 from 25,500 last quarter.\nThis quarter's total paying customer count includes a onetime cleanup of about 200 financially immaterial customers at the very low end, who are moved to our free tier. Our gross customer additions have remained strong, especially with larger customers. Meanwhile, we are seeing some churn of smaller customers who have limited impact on our revenues.\nAs a result, our gross revenue retention rate remains unchanged in the mid- to high 90s, indicating the stickiness of our product and the importance of our product to our customers' operations. We are executing on strong new logo bookings and new customers contributing meaningfully to our growth as they ramp up.\nAs Olivier mentioned, we had our second largest new logo bookings quarter and a record for Q2. We expect these customers to become more meaningful as they expand with us. In Q2, about 40% of our year-over-year revenue growth or 10 points of growth was attributable to growth from these new customers that were acquired in the past year.\nFinally, we continue to see consolidation opportunities, particularly in larger deals. Consolidation allows our customers to improve functionality by getting all of their data into 1 platform, while saving money at the same time. Moving on to our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR. NRR was over 120% in Q2 as customers increased their usage and adopted more products. As we expected and as we discussed on last quarter's call, our trailing 12-month NRR decline but was above 120 in Q2 as existing customers continue to scrutinize their tech stack costs and make efficiency improvements.\nIf our growth trajectory continues at current levels, we expect our trailing 12-month NRR to decline to below 120 in Q3. Moving on to our financial results. Billings were $520 million in the quarter, up 31% year-over-year. Billings duration increased slightly year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.25 billion, up 42% year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO growth was about up 30% year-over-year. We signed some larger multiyear deals in the quarter, which drove an increase in the duration year-over-year. As we've mentioned before, we continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $414 million, representing a gross margin of 81.3%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.5% last quarter and 80.8% in the year ago quarter.\nWe continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. As a result, we are experiencing a gross margin, which is in excess of our target in the high 70s. Our Q2 OpEx grew 26% year-over-year, and this was a decline from 45% year-over-year growth last quarter. We moderated our hiring pace and executed on controlling costs, given the macro uncertainties.\nQ2 operating income was $106 million or a 21% operating margin, up from 18% last quarter and flat to 21% in the year ago quarter. We are pleased with our execution on cost control and disciplined investment in this quarter.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash from operations was $153 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $142 million for a free cash flow margin of 28%.\nNow turning to our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the usage growth of our existing customers. As a reminder, our guidance philosophy is to carry forward trends observed in recent quarters, discounted with additional conservative.\nFor the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $521 million to $525 million, which represents a 19% to 20% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $98 million to $102 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.35 per share based on approximately 354 weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion, which represents 22% to 23% year-over-year growth.\nNon-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $390 million to $400 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.30 to $0.34 per share and based on approximately 351 million average sales diluted shares outstanding.\nNow finally, for some additional notes on the guidance. We have continued to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large long-term opportunities, and we are executing well on our plans to invest efficiently. Next, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $85 million and we expect our tax expense for the full year to be $14 million to $16 million. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be about 4% of revenues in fiscal year 2023.\nTo reiterate Olivier's comments, we remain excited about our long-term growth opportunities and we're continuing to execute against those opportunities. I want to thank our Datadog worldwide for our efforts in this quarter. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

Thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our execution in Q1 as we continued broadening our platform, delivering new use cases for our existing users as well as signing up more customers, all on the backdrop of continued macro uncertainty and optimization of cloud workloads.\nLet me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance. In Q1, revenue was $482 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Note that this number factors in the impact of a service outage we experienced in March and which reduced our revenue for the quarter by about $5 million.\nLet me start with a review of our Q1 financial performance.

And 19% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 12% last year.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we experienced business conditions that were similar to the previous several quarters. In Q1, user's growth from existing customers came in roughly as expected. We saw existing customer users growth in Q1 improved from the levels we saw in Q4 but remain a bit lower than the levels we experienced in Q2 and Q3. And as in recent quarters, we continue to see customers optimize their cloud spend, particularly those further along in their cloud migration and hosting a larger portion of their infrastructure in the cloud.\nNow let's discuss this quarter's business drivers.

New local bookings reached a new record for Q1 and were up slightly from last year as we continued to add many promising new logos, which I'll discuss in a bit. With our land and expand model, we expect many of these new logos will turn into much larger customers as they add up more of our products over time.\nAdditionally, our new logo acquisition and bookings in Q1 were solid for what is a seasonally slower quarter.

We introduced a number of new security capabilities last month. We announced the general availability of Application Vulnerability Management, which provides visibility into the attack surface of production environment by automatically surfacing vulnerabilities. And instead of submerging users with thousands upon thousands of vulnerabilities, this new functionality is observability data to prioritize risks based on the estimated impact to the business and closes the loop between security, operations and development teams.\nNow let's move on to R&D.

In Q1, we continued to execute well and deliver value to our customers. Revenue was $482 million, up 33% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-to-quarter.\nTo dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance, first, we had an unusual outage in March, and we estimate that the impact to our revenues from that outage to be about $5 million. As we mentioned last quarter, we saw subdued usage growth in the month of December which created a lower growth trajectory to start the first quarter and drove seasonally weaker sequential growth in the first quarter.\nTo dive into some of the drivers of the Q1 performance, first, we had an unusual outage in March, and we estimate that the impact to our revenues from that outage to be about $5 million.

We had a solid Q4 to end a strong fiscal year 2022. We delivered significant new innovations for our customers, we saw increasing adoption of our products and we attracted thousands of new customers to our platform. Meanwhile, we delivered strong revenue growth, margins, non-GAAP operating profit, and we generated more than $350 million in free cash flow.\nLet me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. In Q4, revenue was $469 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 23,200 customers, up from about 18,800 last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,780 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,010 last year. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR. And we had 317 customers with ARR of $1 million or more compared to the 216 we had at the end of last year. We generated free cash flow of $96 million with a free cash flow margin of 21%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted more products.\nOur platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 81% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 78% a year ago; 42% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 33% a year ago; and 18% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 10% last year.\nNow moving on to this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we observed slower usage growth with existing customers while continuing to scale our new logo acquisition and new product cross-sells. Starting with usage. Usage growth of existing customers in Q4 was overall slightly lower than what we observed in Q2 and Q3, which we attribute, first, to a continuation of cloud cost optimization by our larger spending customers; and second, to a seasonal annual slowdown in the second half of December that was more pronounced than in previous years. As in Q2 and Q3, we continue to see more optimization from customers as a larger cloud footprint, while our smaller spending customers are exhibiting higher growth.\nFrom a product perspective, we didn't see meaningful differences among our major products as they all experienced solid growth, albeit decelerating on a year-over-year basis. In contrast to this deceleration in usage growth for existing customers, we continue to execute on new logo lands and multiproduct adoption, and we also continue to see stable, very strong growth retention trends.\nFirst, we had our strongest new logo quarter to date, with a record level of new logo ARR bookings. Second, our sales pipeline remains healthy as our pattern of new logo and cross-sell is scaling above the levels of the past years, and we see demand growing along with our investments in go-to market.\nI'd also like to point out that although we have made steady progress, we still see significant opportunities to grow our penetration in total spend amounts with larger customers. As a data point, as of January 2023, 37% of the Fortune 500 are Datadog customers, up from 30% last year. For these customers, the median Datadog ARR is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This leaves a very large opportunity for us to go with these customers as they continue to move towards the cloud and more of them develop.\nWe are also pleased with the initial take-up of some of our newest products, including Cloud Cost Management, for which we already added a mid-6-figure commitment last month from a global fast food chain. And finally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention steady in the mid- to high 90s. We believe this high retention number is indicative of the business criticality of Datadog for our customers.\nNow let's move on to R&D. During the quarter, we released our latest product to general availability, Universal Service Monitoring, which detects all micro services across an organization's environment and provides instant visibility into their health and dependencies, all without any code changes. Universal Service Monitoring bridges our existing monitoring and application performance monitoring capabilities and it involves end-to-end observability with minimal deployment friction.\nNow let's take a moment to review the R&D team's accomplishments in 2022. We ended the year with 17 generally available products, up from 13 at the end of 2021, and we greatly expanded the capabilities of our existing products. Overall, in 2022, we have meaningfully broadened our observability capabilities and pushed forward in making each product best of breed. Meanwhile, we have made meaningful progress but remain in early days in the new areas of cloud security and developer experience.\nIn observability, we continue to expand our end-to-end unified platform. We now have more than 600 integrations, including all the latest products on AWS, GCP and Azure. We launched new AI capabilities, such as Watchdog Log Anomaly Detection to help customers separate signal from noise in data and Watchdog Root Cause Analysis to identify the root cause of issues and quantify their impact in customers.\nWe launched Cloud Cost Management to help customers take control of their infrastructure costs. We announced Service Catalog to manage service ownership at scale. We made Observability Pipelines generally available, enabling customers to collect and transform data from any source to any destination, all at petabyte scale. We launched Audit Trail to help customers achieve their compliance and governance goals. We extended Sensitive Data Scanner beyond logs to inspect APM and REM data flows. And we now collect data from SNMP Traps to provide greater visibility into physical network equipment.\nIn cloud security, we kept building out our platform. We launched Cloud Security Management, our rich context-aware CNAPP platform. We launched Application Security Management, building on our acquisition of Sqreen in 2021, and we announced the beta of Native Protection to block malicious factors directly within the data platform.\nIn developer experience, we are expanding on our CI Visibility product. We introduced continuous testing to bring efficient and reliable testing within CI/CD pipelines, and we launched the beta of Intelligence Test Runners, which significantly reduces the time and cost of running tests.\nAnd last but not least, we delivered a number of platform-wide initiatives. We achieved FedRAMP moderate authorization and have since landed a number of government agencies as customers. Our customers today can also use CoScreen for collaboration, incident response, preprogramming and debugging less than a year after the acquisition, and we continue to expand on the HIPAA and PCI compliance of our products. As you can tell, we've been busy, and I want to thank the R&D team for a very productive year.\nLooking ahead to 2023, our teams are continuing to push forward as beta products from 2022 include data streams monitoring, workflow automation, event correlation, heat maps, dynamic instrumentation, workload security profiling, resource catalog and native protection, among others. We also continue to integrate our 2022 acquisitions, CoScreen, Hdiv, Seekret and Cloudcraft into the Datadog platform, and we are excited for their potential. In summary, we're looking forward to delivering many more capabilities to help our customers in 2023.\nNow let's move on to sales and marketing. Our go-to-market teams continue to execute very well into the end of 2022, in particular on new logo lands. So let's go over a few of our wins this quarter. First, we signed a 7-figure land with a Fortune 500 industrial group. This company was using multiple open-source and built-in cloud monitoring tools, which led to release delays and consumer-facing outages. In addition to our metric [transition] log, this company will rely on our ability to integrate open telemetry data sources to deliver immediate value. This customer's initial deal includes 13 products across our observability, security and developer experience categories.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure land with a Fortune 500 financial services company. This customer is moving hundreds of applications from on-prem to the cloud and multiple legacy tools were creating gaps in visibility and post-PCI compliance problems. This customer today is looking at savings of roughly $1 million in the first year of using Datadog and a meaningful reduction in mean time to resolution. This deal will start with infrastructure monitoring and replace 3 different tools with plans to expand to other Datadog products in the future.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure land deal with a major federal government agency. This agency was looking to reduce tool sprawl and aimed at a rapid rollout to hundreds of different programs while saving money on engineering and issue resolution. This agency is among a number of new government customers in 2022, following our FedRAMP moderate authorization. And this deal is expected to displace at least 8 commercial legacy monitoring tools.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure land deal with a leading Japanese system integrator. This company has been a very successful hardware system integrator and is looking to grow its digital and cloud transformation business. This customer plans to add up 15 Datadog products in order to support its ambitious growth plan.\nAnd last for today, we signed a multimillion dollar expansion with one of the world's leading insurance companies. Prior to using Datadog, this company was using more than 30 tools across 9 business units. By consolidating onto Datadog, the customer estimates it's achieved roughly 115% ROI all within a year while reducing average mean time to resolution from 1.5 hours to 15 minutes. With this renewal, this company is adding database monitoring, cloud security management and application security management and is now using 12 Datadog products.\nThat's it for this quarter's customer highlights. And again, I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their great execution in Q4 and throughout 2022.\nNow let me speak to our longer-term outlook and my thoughts on 2023. Although we are seeing customers be more cautious with their cloud usage expansion in the near term, we see no change to the long-term trends towards digital transformation and cloud migration. We think it's healthy for customers to optimize, and we believe that the ability to correct course and continually align the nature and scale of their applications with their business needs is one of the key benefits of cloud transformation.\nAt Datadog, we have always organized our products and our business around helping customers gain agility and reduce costs, and we do it by enabling stronger business performance and efficient use of their engineering and infrastructure spend. Regardless of near-term macro pressure, we believe it is still early days, and we expect that companies worldwide will continue to grow their next-gen IT footprint to deliver value to their customers.\nGiven the large opportunities we see in front of us, we plan to keep building and innovating. We have already made progress in observability, but we still have much to do to deliver more value and solve more problems for our customers. And we are excited about our opportunities in cloud security, developer experience as well as our early efforts in areas around ITSM and real-time business intelligence.\nAs we have since we founded Datadog, we are also balancing long-term investments against maintaining the discipline to ensure our continual financial performance. We recognize that the macro environment remains uncertain. So while we continue to focus on scaling and investing, we are growing those investments in a disciplined fashion in 2023, and David will discuss this in more detail. We remain confident in our long-term opportunities, and we are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to catch up them.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nCFO, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. In Q4, we continued to execute well and delivered value to our customers. Revenue was $469 million, up 44% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q4 performance, first, we saw existing customer usage growth in October and November at a similar level to what we saw in Q2 and Q3. In the month of December, we saw a slower growth dynamic as the typical slowdown we see at the end of December was more pronounced than in previous years. As a result, the growth rate in usage by existing customers was lower in Q4 than in Q2 and Q3.\nNext, similar to Q2 and Q3, we saw larger-spending customers grow slower than smaller-spending customers. As with Q2 and Q3, we saw relatively more deceleration in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food delivery. Geographically, we saw solid and relatively similar growth across all regions.\nAs Olivier discussed, we experienced strong new logo ARR growth and low churn again in this quarter. We had a record level of new logo bookings in the quarter across customer sizes. Our dollar net base net retention remained at strong levels, above 130% for the 22nd consecutive quarter. And gross revenue retention has remained unchanged over the last several quarters and remained steady in the mid- to high 90s. We believe this high and steady gross retention points to the mission-critical nature of the Datadog platform for our customers.\nNow moving on to our financial results. Billings in the quarter were $536 million, up 31% year-over-year. Billings duration was slightly lower year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $1.06 billion, up 30% year-over-year, and RPO duration declined on a year-over-year basis. And we note that current RPO growth was in the high 30s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $378 million, representing a gross margin of 81%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and also 80% in the year-ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs, reflected in our cost of goods sold in this quarter. In the mid- to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range.\nOur Q4 non-GAAP OpEx grew 54% year-over-year as we continue to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market. Q4 operating income was $83 million or an 18% operating margin compared to an operating income of $71 million or a 22% operating margin in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, the year ago operating margin benefited from lack of in-person office, travel and event costs due to our COVID policies during the pandemic.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $114 million in the quarter. And after taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $96 million for a free cash flow margin of 21%.\nNow for our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2023. In forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers compared to historical periods. And as usual, we are basing our near-term guidance on recent activity we see with our customers. We are incorporating an expectation for seasonally weaker growth in the first quarter due to the subdued growth in the month of December that creates a lower growth trajectory to start the first quarter. While our customers are continuing to expand with us, we are assuming in our guidance that cloud optimization continues to affect our expansion rate in 2023.\nFor the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $466 million to $470 million, which represents a 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $68 million to $72 million or an operating margin of 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.09 billion, which represents a 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million for a margin of 15% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.09 per share based on approximately 351 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nNow some additional notes on the guidance. First, regarding our fiscal year 2023 investments, we continue to balance near-term financial strength with investment in our large long-term opportunities. Our non-GAAP operating income guidance reflects this discipline.\nWe will continue to grow our R&D and go-to-market teams as we broaden our platform in service of our customer needs, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years. As a result, we are planning to grow our operating expenses, including COGS, in the fiscal year 2023 in the low 30s percent range year-over-year. We plan to grow our headcount in fiscal year 2023 in the mid-20s percent range year-over-year. This compares to fiscal 2022 headcount growth of approximately 50% year-over-year.\nNext, as interest rates have risen, our interest income has increased and become more meaningful. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $75 million. We expect tax expense in fiscal year 2023 to be $11 million to $13 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the range of 4% to 5% of revenues in fiscal year 2023.\nTo reiterate Olivier's comments, we see no change to our long-term opportunities as our customers embark and expand on their cloud migration and digital transformation plans. We remain strongly positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with these journeys. I want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their efforts in 2022, and I'm excited about our plans for the next year.\nWith that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

We are pleased to report strong results in Q3 as we continued to execute on our platform vision. Let me start with a review of our financial performance.\nIn Q3, revenue was $437 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 22,200 customers, up from about 17,500 in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,600 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 1,800 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR.\nWe generated free cash flow of $67 million, with a free cash flow margin of 15%. And our dollar-based net retention rates continue to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted more products.\nNext, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q3, 80% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 77% a year ago. 40% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 31% a year ago, and 16% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 8% a year ago. We continue to be pleased with this continued adoption of multiple products in our platform, which indicates the additional value we are bringing to our customers.\nWe continue to see strong ARR growth with our newer offerings, and our products introduced since 2019, which excludes infrastructure monitoring, core APM and log management, remain in hypergrowth mode. I also want to highlight a couple of our newer products, Database Monitoring and CI Visibility. We started charging for these products 3 and 2 quarters ago, respectively, and each has already exceeded 8 figures in ARR and more than 1,000 customers. And as we are further developing them, we are confident these products will lead to a broader set of use cases for a larger set of customers over time.\nNow moving on to this quarter's business drivers. At a high level, Q3 was overall very similar to Q2, with strong performance in new logos and new [product-attached] activities, tempered by growth of users from existing customers, although healthy, was below our long-term historical averages. This added up to sequential net ARR added that was similar to Q2.\nTo give a bit more color, first on the usage trend. As we said, usage growth was overall solid but consistent with Q2 trends. From a product perspective, [the trend] was more homogeneous among our major products than it had been in Q2. Looking at industry verticals, similar to last quarter, we continue to see a more pronounced effect in consumer discretionary and, in particular, with our customers that are cloud-native and fully scaled into public cloud. Note that the consumer discretionary vertical represents low teens percent of ARR and includes e-commerce as well as food and delivery.\nAll that said, we are pleased with our continued strong performance. Revenue in Q3 grew 61% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter, with all of our products meaningfully outperforming the growth of the large cloud providers. While the macroeconomic environment is likely to remain a headwind in the near term, we continue to see positive trends underpinning our business and remain bullish about the long-term opportunities and aggressive with our investment plan.\nFirst, we continue to see strong growth in new logo ARR, including some large wins in traditional industries. We'll talk about some of those in a bit.\nSecond, our sales pipeline is strong heading into Q4 for both new logos and new products. And we're seeing great opportunities across customer sizes, geographies and industries. Alongside our strength in new logo ARR, this gives us confidence that digital transformation and cloud migration remain a top priority. It is perhaps even more critical in difficult times when businesses need to be more agile and do more with less. Remember that given our usage-based operating model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue, but they are very important to us as new customers expand their usage in succeeding quarters and succeeding years.\nThird, we are seeing continued expansion on our platform, as indicated by customers adopting more of our products.\nAnd finally, churn remains low and hasn't changed, with gross revenue retention steady in the mid- to high 90s. We believe this high gross revenue retention is indicative of the business criticality of Datadog for our customers.\nNow let's move on to products and R&D. 2 weeks ago, we had our Dash user conference, which was an occasion to showcase the extension of our products and the results of our R&D investments. Let me go through some of these starting, with observability, before moving on to security, developer experience and, finally, the ability to take action within Datadog.\nFirst, we are doubling down on our investments in observability, starting with 2 new products: data stream monitoring and Cloud Cost Management, both addressing growing needs and strong demand from our customers. We also extended our APM suite to offer mobile app testing, usage heat map and dynamic instrumentation. On the network side, we added SNMP Traps and [network] monitoring to our products. On the logging side, we announced log forwarding, which coupled with log archives and observability pipeline that is at the center of our customers' data management.\nResponding to customer demand, we also extended our Sensitive Data Scanner beyond logs to identify sensitive data across APM and RUM. And across the platform, we've announced extended support for OpenTelemetry, PCI compliance for APM and log as well as HIPAA compliance across most of Datadog.\nSecond, we are extending our security platform, and we announced Cloud Security Management, which brings together Cloud Workload Security, Cloud Security Posture Management and resource catalog as a frictionless, reach-and-context aware cloud-native application protection platform, or CNAP.\nWe launched native protection for Application Security Management to enable blocking attacks in real time directly within the Datadog platform. And we now provide vulnerability monitoring to give our users a high-fidelity picture of all applications in production as well as their dependencies, vulnerabilities and the attacks they face.\nThird, we follow through with our recent entry in developer experience. We announced continuous testing to facilitate end-to-end testing as soon as the code is developed, which increases quality and velocity at the same time. And we showcase Intelligent Test Runner using more rich APM and profiling data to automatically skip unneeded tests and drastically reduce time and money spend on CI/CD.\nFourth and last but not least, we announced new product areas that take our platform from observing to allowing our users to take action and respond all within Datadog. We announced our [ASM] management products to allow users to correlate and summarize alerts, events and issues in variety of (inaudible) in order to resolve problems directly from the Datadog AIOps console.\nWe also announced Datadog Workflows, which allows customers to develop and run automatically DevOps or security remediation using a no-code editor and already more than 200 integrations to service any APIs they use. We announced [limited] availability for CoScreen, the collaboration meeting tool that we acquired last year and that allows real-time screen sharing and collaborative [product coding] within Datadog.\nAnd finally, we kept on extending the scope of our Watchdog AI engine, further automating the detection and getting the resolution of applications that may cause real problems.\nThat is for the many announcements from Dash. And as you can tell, the team has been hard at work, and I'm extremely proud of our innovation velocity and focus on our customers.\nOne last thing on products. As announced in the press release issued this morning, we acquired Cloudcraft, a planning and design tool used by tens of thousands of cloud architects to create live diagrams of their infrastructures, including real-time health, configuration and cost data, and we are very excited for their team to join Datadog.\nNow moving on to sales and marketing. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q3. First, we signed a 7-year land with a Fortune 100 grocery chain. This company was [marketing] to Azure but was held back by their open source solution. And because this grocery chain has pharmacies inside stores, they need better controls around personally identifiable information. Our Sensitive Data Scanner and our HIPAA compliance filled that gap, and we are differentiators [who are then out] to win these opportunities.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure land with a major multinational restaurant chain. This company had a legacy observability solution that wasn't able to scale with their vision of a (inaudible) and serverless environment. They also needed an end-to-end view of their customer journey, and we will now use 6 Datadog products, including Synthetics and RUM,, to drive customer experience improvements.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure land with a social networking app. This company was previously a Datadog customer that had moved several years ago to a competitor as they needed certain languages our APM products didn't support well at the time. Today, our APM not only match the capabilities of the existing solution but presented significant advantages in terms of ease of deployment, alerting and early detection. And they also plan to take advantage of our new service catalog, taking Datadog at the center of their operations.\nNext, we had a 7-figure upsell with a large Asia-based electronic conglomerate. This company's many business units include consumer electronics and IoT. And the use of Datadog has grown rapidly with the number of devices they are managing. They have seen a number of benefits from using Datadog, including lowering the amount of (inaudible) by 25% and mean time to resolution by 50%. They have also seen a significant time savings in incident response activities by cloud engineers from 20 hours to only 2 hours per week. With this renewal, this customer has now adopted 14 Datadog products.\nNext, we had an 8-figure multiyear upsell with a large e-commerce company. This customer had been using primarily infrastructure monitoring and APM Datadog and was also operating an open-source logging tool. Using Datadog led to significant efficiencies, including settling customer-impacting incidents by close to 2/3 and reducing the number of employees required to address each incident by 1/3. With this renewal, they are adopting Datadog Log Management and RUM and consolidating multiple homegrown and cloud-native tools as well as a commercial competitor.\nThat's it for this quarter's customer highlights. And I'd like to thank our go-to-market team for their hard work and for delivering another strong quarter.\nNow let me stick to our longer-term outlook. We recognize the macro environment remains uncertain, but we continue to see no change to the multiyear trend towards digital transformation and cloud migration. And we remain confident that we can help our customers with their efforts to save on costs, drive greater engineering efficiency and take advantage of the benefits of cloud and other next-gen technologies. So we are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to capture our long-term opportunity, and we remain laser-focused on bringing value to our customers as they manage through a more challenging economic environment.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nCFO, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. In Q3, we continued to execute well and support our customers. Revenue was $437 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter.\nTo dive into some of the drivers. First, we experienced strong new logo ARR growth and continued low churn again this quarter. We saw existing customer usage growth remain at levels similar to Q2 as customers continue to be more cost-conscious as they manage their businesses. As Olivier noted, we saw a roughly similar sequential growth in ARR dollars added in Q2 as -- in Q3 as in Q2. And we saw a relatively homogenous usage growth amongst our major products during Q3. As with Q2, we saw relatively more deceleration in the consumer discretionary vertical, particularly in e-commerce and food and delivery.\nAnd we saw similar growth across geographies. As a reminder, we bill all of our revenue in U.S. dollars, and we do not price in local currencies. Our dollar-based net retention remained at strong levels above 130% for the 20th consecutive -- 21st consecutive quarter.\nOur land and expand model, aggressive product innovation and our customers' motion to the cloud continue to drive expansion opportunities with our existing customer base. Overall, the customer usage growth we're seeing remains higher than the trough growth we experienced at the beginning of COVID in 2020, and we're pleased with our 61% year-over-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth this quarter.\nMeanwhile, gross revenue retention was unchanged and steady in the mid- to high 90s. Regardless of the macroeconomic environment, our customers still need to serve their clients, and moving to the cloud enables better service and cost savings against people-intensive or on-prem technology-based offerings. We believe our high and steady gross retention indicates that Datadog is critical to our customers' ability to deliver services to their clients digitally.\nAnd as Oli mentioned, on new logos, we saw continued strong new logo ARR growth across geographies, industries and company sizes, and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities in Q4. Finally, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers, with 80% of our customers using 2 or more products, 40% using 4 or more products and 16% using 6 or more products as of the end of Q3.\nMoving on to our financial statements. Billings were $467 million, up 51% year-over-year. Billings duration was slightly lower year-over-year.\nRemaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $941 million, up 31% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-40s year-over-year. As a reminder, we signed several large multiyear renewals in Q3 2021, which may make current RPO, a more useful indicator with -- as it excludes the multiyear duration impact. We also had a challenging comparables of that metric as Q3 of last year's current RPO growth was about 100%. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoices and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nFirst, gross profit in the quarter was $348 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 81% last quarter and 78% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range.\nOur Q3 non-GAAP OpEx grew 65% year-over-year as we continued to grow our headcount in R&D and go-to-market. Q3 operating income was $75 million or a 17% operating margin compared to an operating income of $44 million or a 16% operating margin in the year ago quarter.\nThen turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $84 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $67 million for a free cash flow margin of 15%.\nNow for our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022. First, in forming our guidance, we continue to use conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of our customers. And as usual, we are basing our guidance on current economic conditions, which includes slower-than-historical growth in usage among existing customers as we have seen in Q2 and Q3.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $445 million to $449 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $56 million to $60 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.18 to $0.20 per share range based on an approximate 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.654 billion, which represents 61% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. And non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $304 million, with non-GAAP net income per share expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.92 per share, again, based on an approximate 346 million weighted average annual diluted shares.\nNow some notes on guidance. As we discussed last quarter, Q4 includes some large-input person events, including our Dash user conference, which was held 2 weeks ago, and AWS re:Invent, our largest trade show event of the year. The cost of those events will result in an approximate 300-to-400-basis-point effect on margins.\nAs it relates to our capital expenditures, we are adding more office space around the world as we continue to return to office. We expect CapEx of about $15 million in Q4.\nIn conclusion, while we recognize macroeconomic uncertainty continued into Q3, we see no change in the importance of cloud migration and digital transformation, which are critical to our customers' competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned to help our customers embark on these journeys, and we are investing aggressively into our long-term opportunities while maintaining our financial strap.\nI want to thank Datadogs worldwide for their participation in these efforts.\nAnd with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

My name is Cheryl and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Yuka Broderick. You may begin.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nIR, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cheryl. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning.\nJoining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2022, our gross margins and operating margins, our strategy, our product capabilities and our ability to capitalize on market opportunities.\nThe words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call.\nWe will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables, in our earnings release, which is available at investor.datadoghq.com.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning.\nWe are pleased to report strong results in Q2 as we executed well, and we extended our category leadership. Let me start off with a review of our Q2 financial performance.\nIn Q2, revenue was $406 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 21,200 customers, up from about 16,400 in the year ago quarter.\nWe ended the quarter with about 2,420 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,570 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR.\nWe generated free cash flow of $60 million and a free cash flow margin of 15%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continues to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted more products.\nNow moving on to this quarter's business drivers. In Q2, while we overall saw strong customer growth dynamics, we have seen some variability in growth among our customers. We saw our larger spending customers continue to grow but at a rate that was lower than historical levels.\nThis effect was more pronounced in certain industries, particularly in consumer discretionary, which includes e-commerce and food and delivery customers and affected more specifically our products with a strong volume-based component such as log management and APM suite.\nNote that we did not see this with our SMB and lower spending customers who continued growing with us as they have in the past.\nWhile these near growth data points and the current micro climate are leading us to be prudent with our short-term outlook, we remain very bullish about our opportunities and confident in our execution as we continue to see positive trends underpinning our business.\nFirst, the number of hosts and containers being monitored by our customers is growing steadily, which points to continued momentum of cloud migration and digital transformation projects.\nSecond, we had strong execution on the new logo side as new logo ARR was robust as we added a record 1,400 new customers in the quarter, including the impact of turning off about 200 customers in Russia and Belarus in Q2.\nAnd we closed a number of sizable 6 to 7-figure year-over-year deal during the quarter with diverse customers, including a media conglomerate, a metal ore mining company, a U.S. government agency, the SaaS business and a hyperscaler.\nThird, our pipeline of large new logos and new product cross-sells going into the second half of the year is strong.\nAnd fourth, churn remains low with gross revenue retention steady in the mid- to high 90s.\nMoving on to our products. We are pleased with the continued adoption and expansion of our products for our customers. The 3 pillars of Observability, which are infrastructure, APM and log management all grew strongly in Q2.\nOur APM suite and log management now exceeds [$0.25 billion] of ARR. As a reminder, we define APM suite as including core APM, Synthetics, RUM and Continuous Profiler.\nIn addition to that, infrastructure monitoring continued to grow strongly on par with recent quarters. We're also pleased with the adoption of our newer products. Our newer products, excluding infrastructure monitoring, APM suite and log management, continue to grow ARR more than 100% year-over-year. And we've seen a strong start with our CI Visibility product, which we announced at Dash last year and started charging for just a few months ago. CI Visibility already has more than 1,000 paying customers, including some product-specific new logos.\nOur platform strategy also continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q2, 79% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 75% a year ago. 37% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 28% a year ago and 14% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 6% a year ago.\nNow let's move on to product and R&D, where our teams delivered another strong quarter of innovation.\nIn June, Gartner published a 2022 Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and Observability. Datadog has once again been the leader, and having improved from last year on our scores and ranking in all dimensions. We attribute this to -- first to our unified platform experience, covering DevOps, securities, and order to [preserve] in one place.\nBut we also see it as a recognition of the continued evolution of Watchdog, our AI engine, which takes over the complexity of monitoring cloud native architectures and provides proactive alerts, carry trouble-shooting and fully automate with cloud analysis.\nWe're very pleased that our APM product went from GA to best-of-breed in just 5 years, and I want again to congratulate our teams for this achievement.\nIn June, we announced the general availability of Observability Pipelines, the 15th product in Datadog platform. As a reminder, this is based on our 2021 acquisition of Timber, the company behind a very popular open-source project named Vector.\nAs organizations scale their applications, the volume of telemetry data grows exponentially. Engineers must manage large volumes of metrics, traces and logs and wrap them from many sources to [better destination]. And this complexity leads to vendor lock-in, core data quality, risks of sensitive data leaks and an increase in overall management costs.\nBy using Datadog Observability Pipelines, customers can control the cost and volume of data, decouple data sources from their destination, standardize and improving data quality and redact sensitive data to have maintained compliance.\nNext, we announced the general availability of Audit Trail in June, helping businesses safely adopt Datadog platform, while maintaining compliance, enforcing governance and building greater transparency.\nAnd this week, we announced the general availability of Service Catalog. With cloud architectures, customers are often creating hundreds of thousands of interconnected services, which are owned and developed by globally distributed teams. This large network of services often makes Root Cause Analysis difficult, which can be challenging to understand what to do to remediate issues or who to call for help.\nOur Service Catalog inventory services defines team ownerships and displays configurations independencies very similarly to what CMDBs might do or where CMDBs are typically manually populated. Our Service Catalog can identify this information automatically as it was specifically designed for the cloud edge.\nFinally, this morning, we announced that we acquired Seekret, which is spelled S-E-E-K-R-E-T. Seekret API Observability Platform gives engineering teams to control their needs to better manage their private, public and third-party sets of APIs. With Seekret, we will accelerate on our path to bring customers visibility into the APIs and overtime, unlock new exciting capabilities for our APM suite on our security platform.\nThat's it for our product update this quarter. And needless to say, we're all very grateful to our engineering and product teams for their continued hard work.\nNow moving on to sales and marketing. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q2. First, we signed a 7-figure upsell with a global services and audit company. This customer is going through a large-scale digital transformation, including migrating from on-prem data centers to multiple clouds and in particular, Azure. They are consolidating 9 disparate legacy and open source tools to Datadog as their strategic platform and purchase all of our products, as well as our premier support and technical account management services.\nNext, we had a 7-figure upsell with a managed service provider in Asia that is a top Datadog-authorized partner in the region. This customer transitioned from their legacy monitoring tool to Datadog and adopted the entire Datadog platform. They are experiencing rapid growth as they sell their MSP services to -- at the U.S. and CDN customers, and we are expanding the opportunity as well as ours in APAC.\nNext, we had a 7-figure land with a multinational media company. This customer has aggressive expansion plans for its streaming service, including in international markets. But they found that their current mix of open source and legacy solutions wasn't meeting their needs. They calculated Datadog with before itself simply by accelerating resolution of just one of their major incidents and avoiding loss of revenue. This customer started with infrastructure, APM and log management, with the opportunity to expand and to more usage in products as the company scales.\nNext, we had a 6-figure land with a Fortune 500 logistics company. 3 years ago, this customer chose legacy monitoring providers and homegrown solutions over Datadog. Now our platform has come a long way since then.\nMeanwhile, incumbents were unable to meet these customers' needs, particularly around their communities adoption, leading to dozens of high-profile incidents a year with a high time to resolution. Additionally, these customer expects to save nearly $3 million in developer resources by consolidating multiple products with Datadog.\nFinally, we had a 6-figure land with a gaming division at hyperscaler. Previously, this company was primarily using open source and its own hyperscaler native tooling. But despite deep technical expertise, homegrown solutions were lacking granularity and consumed critical engineering resources. By using Datadog, this customer unlocked a prescriptive way to visualize alert and maintain the cloud gaming services.\nIn addition to these wins, we also had a number of sizable 6- and 7-figure new logo and expansion wins with companies that have recently experienced business contraction and announced staff reductions. These customers are looking to streamline their operations, save on engineering costs or consolidate multiple vendors on the strategic platform. We believe that software is a deflationary force and we are confident in our ability to help our customers do more with less, should economic conditions worsen.\nAnd these were this quarter's customer highlights, I'd like to thank our go-to-market teams for their efforts and continued execution.\nNow let me speak to our longer-term outlook. We recognize the macro environment is uncertain as we look into the back half of 2022. But we also see no change to the long-term trends towards cloud-based services and modern DevOps environments, and Observability remains critical to that journey. We continue to drive market leadership and for our customer's value, efficiency and cost savings to solve their complex monitoring problems.\nAs a result, we continue to feel very confident in our opportunities. We believe cloud migration and digital transformation are drivers of our long-term growth and our multiyear trends that are still early in their life cycle. And we believe it is increasingly critical for companies to embark on these journeys in order to move faster, serve their customers better and in times like these become more efficient with their infrastructure and engineering investments.\nSo we plan to continue to invest in our solid priorities to execute on these long-term opportunities. At the same time, we will continue to closely monitor the demand environment and we'll calibrate further, if necessary, to balance our long-term investments with financial strength.\nBefore I hand it over to David, I wanted to make a couple of announcements. First, we are holding Dash 2022, our user conference on October 18 and 19 at the Javits Center in New York City. This is an occasion for us to showcase our latest product innovations and we're excited to show the one that we've been up to. We also will organize an investor meeting at Dash and we'll share more details on it shortly.\nAnd last but not least, we are pleased to welcome Titi Cole to our Board of Directors. Titi is CEO of Legacy Franchises at Citigroup and brings over 25 years of experience in senior global leadership roles in the financial services industry. The perspective and experience will be incredibly valuable as we continue to be on scale.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nCFO, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. We delivered strong financial performance in Q2. Revenue was $406 million, up 74% year-over-year and up 12% quarter-over-quarter.\nAs Olivier described, we executed strongly with robust new logo ARR growth, continued low churn and continued strong platform traction. But we did see some customers beginning to manage costs in response to macroeconomic concerns, which impacted our usage growth with some of our existing customers.\nLooking at our growth with existing customers, our dollar-based net retention was above 130% for the 20th consecutive quarter, remaining strong as we continue to see customers use more existing products and adopt new products on the Datadog platform. We saw usage growth with some existing customers decelerate in Q2 and that deceleration was concentrated in our larger spending customers as opposed to our lesser spending customers, where growth remained steady year-over-year.\nAmongst our industries, we saw relative deceleration in consumer discretionary customers, which represents low teens percent of our ARR.\nAs a reminder, we are highly diversified in industries and segments. And we saw lower expansion rate weighted towards areas of our platform that have volume-based components like certain aspects of log management and APM. Infrastructure monitoring ARR growth was relatively steady year-over-year.\nOn the other hand, our gross retention remained unchanged and steady in the mid- to high 90s. We believe that our gross retention has reached and is sustaining these levels because of the stickiness of our product and the criticality of our platform to our clients.\nAnd as Oli mentioned, our new logos, we saw strong continued new logo acquisition and ARR growth, broadly by geography and across industries and company sizes.\nFinally, our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 79% of our customers now using 2 or more products, 37% using 4 or more products, and 14% using 6 or more products in the Datadog platform as of the end of Q2.\nMoving on to our financial results. Billings were $397 million, up 47% year-over-year. As in previous quarters, we had some differences in the timing of billings of a few large customers, which were built in Q2 last year but were billed in Q1 this year. And pro forma for those adjustments, billings growth year-over-year was in the mid-50s.\nRemaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $881 million, up 51% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-50s year-over-year, and contract duration was slightly lower than the year ago quarter.\nIn addition, we observed that some customers aren't changing their level of usage growth but are being more conservative in their commitments, which impacts billings and RPO growth but not revenue growth.\nAs we said in previous quarters, billings and RPO growth can fluctuate significantly and vary from revenue growth, whether higher or lower due to the timing of invoicing and duration of customer contracts.\nTo illustrate this, we note that billings growth for the first half of the year of 2022 was 72% year-over-year.\nNow let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP, and we have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nGross profit in the quarter was $328 million, representing a gross margin of 81%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% last quarter and 76% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of sales this quarter. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the high 70s range.\nGiven our success in increasing our investments in R&D and go-to-market, our non-GAAP Q2 OpEx grew 65% year-over-year versus 56% year-over-year in Q1. This included our return to in-person office travel and events, which contributed $11 million to the sequential growth of OpEx.\nOperating income in Q2 was $85 million or 21% operating margin compared to operating income of $31 million or 13% operating margin in the year ago quarter.\nNow turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities.\nCash flow from operations was $73 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $60 million with a free cash flow margin of 15%. Our free cash flow margin in the first half of 2022 was 25%.\nNow for our outlook for the third quarter and the fiscal year 2022. First, informing our guidance, we are using conservative assumptions as to the organic growth of customers. Taking into account the macroeconomic uncertainty and recent variability of the growth among certain customers.\nAs Olivier mentioned, we see healthy trends in the host and containers monitored and strong execution in our business, but we recognize customers may have less visibility into their own businesses due to the macroeconomic environment.\nSo for the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $410 million to $414 million, which represents 52% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $51 million to $55 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.15 to $0.17 per share range based on approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor the full year fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.63 billion, which represents 57% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $255 million to $275 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.81 per share based on approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nNow as regards to our margin guidance, I wanted to point out. First, gross margins have recently been at the top of our historical range. In operating expense, we have returned to in-office attendance, travel and events. We estimate that this was a 300 basis point sequential margin impact in Q2, and we expect an additional 100 basis point sequential margin impact in Q3.\nAs Oli mentioned, in Q4, we will hold our Dash user conference and we will participate in the AWS re:Invent, our largest trade show at the end of the year. The cost of these events will be approximately 400 basis points of margin impact. We're back to fully in-person events this year, and we're excited to get in front of customers and showcase our many product innovations.\nNext, we have been successful in making R&D and sales and marketing investments, and we believe these will pay off in the future. While we plan to continue to invest, we will remain judicious and disciplined in our cost structure given macro uncertainties.\nAs indicated by the guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins in the second half of 2022 to be in the low double digits. We are healthily profitable on a non-GAAP basis and our free cash flow generative. And we have built a highly efficient, frictionless business model while driving high ROI on our investments over time.\nOur efficiency and financial strength affords us options in times of macro uncertainty that other market participants will not have, and we intend to make the best of this opportunity to drive our long-term growth. But of course, we are mindful of the environment and are closely monitoring our costs carefully, and we will calibrate further, if necessary, to maintain our financial strength.\nIn conclusion, while we recognize there is greater uncertainty in the macro environment right now, we see no change in the importance of cloud migration and digital transformation, which are critical to our customers' competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned to help our customers embark on these journeys, and we are investing aggressively into our long-term opportunities while maintaining our financial strength.\nI want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts. And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) Please also note, this event is being recorded.\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to Yuka Broderick, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nIR, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's first quarter 2022 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the second quarter and the fiscal year 2022, our gross margins and operating margins including from the impact of R&D, go-to-market, CapEx and increased office activity and marketing, our strategy, our product capabilities, our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and the closing of acquisitions.\nThe words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, and other filings and reports that we may file with the SEC. These filings are available on the Investor Relations section of our website along with a replay of this call.\nWe will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'll start by saying that we are pleased with our execution in Q1 as we continue to drive high revenue growth, along with strong profitability and strong cash generation. To quickly summarize our Q1 financial performance, revenue was $363 million an increase of 83% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 19,800 customers, up from about 15,200 in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with about 2,250 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,406 in the year ago quarter. These customers generated about 85% of our ARR.\nWe are seeing strong efficiencies in our business model with free cash flow of $130 million and free cash flow margin of 36%. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increased their usage and adopted our newer products.\nAt a high level, we saw positive business trends in Q1. Usage growth from existing customers was strong and consistent with historical trends as customers continued on their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, and the Datadog platform continue to expand and deliver more value.\nNew logo ARR was very robust and churn remained low and in line with historical rates. All these factors together led to another strong quarter of ARR added. It was, in fact, our second best quarter of ARR added aside from Q4 of 2021.\nNext, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q1, 81% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 75% a year ago. 35% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 25% a year ago. And 12% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 4% last year.\nWe saw strong growth across the products in our platform in Q1. For example, infrastructure monitoring continues to grow at a rapid [click] and exceeded 3/4 of a billion dollars in ARR in Q1. Our APM suite and log management products had a strong quarter and are in hyper growth mode. As a reminder, our APM suite includes core APM, synthetic studies on monitoring and continues on hire.\nWe're also very pleased with the growth of our user experience product, which are Synthetics and Real User Monitoring more specifically. These products together exceeded $100 million in ARR in Q1. And in security, we are seeing very rapid growth. It's still early days, and we're growing off a smaller base, but we continue to see strong adoption with thousands of customers getting security coverage through the Datadog platform.\nNow let's move on to products and R&D, where our teams delivered another strong quarter of innovation. Just 12 months after we acquired Sqreen, we are pleased to announce the general availability of application security monitoring last week. Some applications and APIs are some of the most common sources of data [breaching], yet companies typically have no ways to effectively detect attacks, so they could be less than code for days or weeks. Some other approaches to application security aim to find vulnerabilities before code reaches production. But these solutions offer and slow down development cycles and overwhelm teams with force positives with no easy way to prioritize these issues.\nThe Datadog Application security monitoring product leverages the full execution context of applications running e-production. This all those teams to focus on attacks that actually matter and provides an immediately actionable remediation path. Application security monitoring is the 14th product in the Datadog platform, and this is the fourth product within our cloud security platform alongside Cloud Team, Cloud Workload Security and Cloud Security Posture Management. With this, Datadog now provides security insights across metrics, traces and logs, and we consider these altogether as version 1 of our Cloud Security platform.\nRemember that we are still in early stages with our security efforts and have much to do to further build out this product, but we are pleased with our progress so far and the usage we are getting from our customers.\nLast month, we also announced that we expanded our Watchdog AI capabilities to include Root Cause Analysis and Log Anomaly Detection. Root Cause Analysis automatically identifies causal relationships between different systems across infrastructure and services -- sorry, across infrastructure and services, and pinpoints their root causes.\nWatchdog also automatically identifies the business impact of any given issue, is in data from a release of data management products. This means not only identifying which mobile applications are impacted, but also the exact users that are affected. This new capability often sold in minutes, the problem that would otherwise take hours (inaudible) by specialists in customers' organizations.\nLog Anomaly Detection on the other hand automatically understands and baselines novel patterns in logs and proactively discovers anomalies such as new patterns, meaningful changes in negative patterns and other error outliers. By surfacing these unusual log patterns, Log Anomaly Detection have seem fine and fix issues faster. In addition to this Watchdog announcement, our engineers released dozens of features and expanded product capabilities in Q1.\nTo give a couple of examples, in Real User Monitoring, we announced the general availability of iOS crash reports and error tracking, as well as a number of improvements to help customers analyze and understand the users performance. In Cloud Security Posture Management, we added support for the Azure platform, enabling customers to understand their compliance both across AWS and Azure in one place.\nIn continuous profile, we now support all commonly used languages, including C, C++, RASP, PHP and .NET. And across Datadog, numerous addition of rules, data sources and integrations are enabling our customers to solve their problems from end to end without leaving the Datadog platform.\nFinally, this morning, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Hdiv. Hdiv is an application security product, which provides a highly accurate vulnerability detection at run-time. It offers interactive application security testing capabilities, which tie vulnerabilities to exact file in line numbers in the code.\nAnd unlike other solutions in this area, Hdiv's rate of false positive is very low, enabling customers to focus on vulnerabilities that actually matter. We believe Hdiv's capabilities and strong team will be an excellent part of our Cloud Security platform, and we're looking forward to integrating the capability into Datadog as soon as this acquisition closes when regulatory requirements are met.\nAccess to our product update this quarter. I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their continued hard work. There are so many new features coming up, and I can only highlight a few of them in this call.\nNow moving on to sales and marketing, our sales team continued to execute and have delivered a strong quarter. Let's discuss some of our wins in Q1. First, we signed an 8-figure upsell with a next-gen fintech company which was our largest ever deal on an ARR basis. This customer is experiencing explosive growth in demand for its products, and availability and performance of their system is critical to avoid loss of revenue. These customers started with us 3 years ago with just Infrastructure Monitoring, and its expansion now includes 6 of our products.\nNext, we had a high 6-figure upsell with a global shipping company. This customer is expanding with Datadog to help them move forward with their Azure migration. In addition to using 5 Datadog products, they are now working with our new services team to help implement best practices on a number of business initiatives that involve increased Datadog adoption. This customer expects to consolidate 10 (inaudible) monitoring tools as they expand their use of Datadog.\nNext, we had a 7-figure upsell with a U.S. Federal entity. We were able to deepen our relationship with this customer after we achieve federal moderate status. Before Datadog, this customer had siloed infrastructures, applications, networks, database and customer experience monitoring this caused blind spots and long time to resolution. With this expansion, they are replacing both homegrown and commercial observability tools and are enabling DevSecOps cultures with a visibility across the full stack and a single source of truth.\nNext, we signed a 7-figure upsell with a leading payment company. Earlier this year, these customers open source logging tool went down making them blind, but they were able to regain visibility by getting Datadog log management up and running within a few hours of that crash. Not only did this customer regain log visibility very quickly. They were also able to use the Datadog platform to scrub personally identifiable information to meet security and compliance requirements. And as they have expanded with Datadog, they have been able to cut the number of engineers who maintain homegrown and print solutions in half and reassign engineers to other products to work in the organization. With this renewal, this customer now uses 13 products from Datadog.\nNext, we had a 6-figure land with a major U.S. hotel company. This company lost half of its engineering team during COVID and needed to use its staff more efficiently. At the same time, it was embarking on an AWS migration and its existing tools were not providing the visibility it needed. By consolidating Datadog, this customer expects to future-proof its cloud strategy and move towards unified end-to-end management across their on-prem and AWS environment.\nAnd finally, we had a 7-figure land with a major European car manufacturer. This customer was frustrated with its existing monitoring tools, which left them with limited visibility into incidents sometimes impacting millions of users globally. As they were trialing Datadog, they were able to solve within minutes issue that used to take them days. With Datadog, this customer expects to consolidate multiple commercial and open source tools across AWS and on-prem stacks.\nThat's it for this quarter's highlights. I want to thank our go-to-market teams for their hard work in delivering a strong start to 2022 after a very busy end of the year. I also want to give a special shout out to our tech solutions and support teams for making our customers successful and enabling them to expand with our own platform.\nMoving on, we feel very good about the demand environment. And as we look over the medium- and long-term, our outlook hasn't changed. We remain confident that cloud migration and digital transformation are drivers of our long-term opportunities and our multiyear trends that are still early in their life cycles.\nWe believe it is increasingly critical for companies to embark on these journeys in order to move faster create competitive differentiation, enable strategic change and serve their customers. And we believe we can help customers manage the complexity as it comes with this transformation. And that Datadog unified platform is more than ever critical to understand, improve and secure their modern stacks in businesses.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, for a review of our financial performance and guidance. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nCFO, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier, and good morning to everyone. To summarize, we delivered strong financial performance in Q1. Revenue was $363 million, up 83% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Usage growth with our existing customers was strong once again in this quarter. And new logo ARR growth was healthy, particularly given the typical slowness that we see in Q1.\nLet's go into some more detail. First, growth of existing customers was strong in Q1, and our dollar-based net retention remained above 130% for the 19th consecutive quarter. Usage growth was strong across the Datadog platform and in line with historical trends. We also saw strong ARR growth in each geographical region, and growth was similar across geographies including EMEA. In early Q2, we began shutting off service to customers in Russia and Belarus. We have about 200 customers in these 2 countries and their contributions to revenue is immaterial.\nOur go-to-market teams delivered another strong quarter. Total customers grew 30% year-over-year and customers with $100,000 or more of ARR grew 60% year-over-year. In addition, we saw strong growth in million-dollar customers. We are pleased to be serving more customers and believe we are still early -- in the early stages of our opportunity in worldwide customer acquisition.\nNew logo ARR was very robust, particularly given that our sales teams participate in sales kickoff and other planning processes at the beginning of Q1. Remember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately transfer into meaningful revenue. Our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers, with 81% of our customers now using 2 or more products, 35% using 4 or more products, and 12% using 6 or more products at the end of Q1.\nFinally, churn has remained low. Our dollar-based gross retention rate continues to be in the mid- to high 90s and was stable quarter-to-quarter. And it's similar across our customer segments and major products.\nBillings were $444 million -- $445 million, up 103% year-over-year. Billings duration in Q1 was similar to the year ago quarter and within the range we've seen historically. We closed several large deals in Q1, including the largest deal by ARR that Olivier discussed earlier, which led to billings growth being higher than revenue growth in Q1. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $858 million, up 85% year-over-year, and contract duration was similar to the year ago quarter. Current RPO growth was in the mid-80s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings or RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review some key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. Gross profit in the quarter was $292 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 80% in the last quarter and 77% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold this quarter. In the mid- to long-term, we continue to expect gross margin to be in the high 70s range.\nOperating income was $84 million or a 23% operating margin compared to operating income of $20 million or a 10% margin in the year ago quarter. We are experiencing significant business efficiencies on strong revenue growth. And in Q1, we had not yet returned fully to in-person meetings, events or are fully back in the office.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $147 million in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $130 million with a free cash flow margin of 36%.\nNow for our outlook for the second quarter in the fiscal year 2022. We remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities. We continue to see cloud migration and digital transformation as trends that are still in relatively early stages, and we are investing aggressively and are successfully executing against these long-term opportunities.\nWith the usual conservatism applied, our outlook is as follows: For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $376 million to $380 million which represents 62% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $49 million to $53 million, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share on an approximately 347 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.62 billion, which represents 56% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.77 per share on an approximate 349 million weighted average diluted shares.\nNow some notes on our guidance. First, when providing guidance, as usual, we use more conservative assumptions than historical performance. Second, our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for long-term growth. In Q1, we are pleased to have had our best-ever quarter of hiring, and we plan to continue hiring aggressively throughout 2022. Our North America and EMEA employees returned to the office at the end of Q1, and our APAC employees are returning to office during Q2. In addition, trade shows and other events are picking up in Q2, as is employee travel. In the past, we have framed the benefit of stopping in-person T&E and marketing events during COVID as 300 to 400 basis points of margin impact. We expect our return to office and increased in-person marketing events, as well as our headcount growth to more fully impact margins in Q2 relative to Q1. And even as we embark on these investments and our return from COVID, we remain solidly profitable, as indicated by our guidance.\nNext, regarding income tax expenses in Q2, we will have a provision of about $3 million related to the Sqreen acquisition as well as our typical provision, mainly related to our international entities. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we are catching up on office build-outs in 2022 and expect CapEx as a percent of sales to roughly double compared to 2021.\nIn conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in Q1. We continue to attract more customers to the Datadog platform. We are broadening our platform's capabilities and observability and we launched application security monitoring in Q1. We are working very hard to execute against our opportunities, and I want to conclude by thanking Datadog's worldwide for their efforts.\nWith that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) And I will now turn the call over to Yuka Broderick, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nYuka Broderick\n\nIR, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThank you, John. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning.\nJoining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the first quarter and the fiscal year 2022, our gross margins and operating margins, including investments in R&D and go-to-market, our strategy, our product capabilities and our ability to capitalize on market opportunities. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and other filings and reports that we may file with the SEC. These filings are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.\n\nOlivier Pomel\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our performance in Q4 where we showed high growth at scale as well as strong business efficiencies. Looking back at 2021, not only do we continue to see a very strong demand environment, we also kept innovating at a rapid pace. And our team executed extremely well to help our customers manage complexity in the cloud area.\nLet's start with a quick summary of Q4. Revenue was $326 million, an increase of 84% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We had about 18,800 customers, up from about 14,200 at the end of last year. We ended the quarter with about 2,010 customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 1,228 at the end of last year. These customers generated about 83% of our ARR.\nWe had 216 customers with ARR of $1 million or more, which is more than double the 101 we had at the end of last year. The leverage and efficiency of our business model is coming through with free cash flow of $107 million. And our dollar-based net retention rate continued to be over 130% as customers increase their usage and adopted our newer product.\nAt a high level, positive business trends from recent quarters continued in Q4. Business growth from existing customers exceeded our expectations this quarter, and we saw strong growth across all the products in our platform in all business segments. We had record new logo ARR in Q4, including some large new enterprise wins. And churn remains low and in line with historical rates. All these factors together led to another record quarter of ARR added.\nNext, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 78% of customers were using 2 or more product, up from 72% a year ago. 33% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 22% a year ago. And as a sign of further adoption of our platform, we saw that 10% of our customers were using 6 or more product, which is up from 3% last year.\nWe saw strong growth across our platform in Q4. Year-over-year growth of infrastructure monitoring ARR has accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3. In addition to that, APM suite and log management products continue to be in hyper-growth mode. And we're very pleased to report that our newer products added about $100 million in ARR in 2021. These are the newer products we launched in 2019, which excludes core infrastructure, core APM and log management.\nNow let's move on to product and R&D, where our teams have not been slowing down and delivered another strong quarter of innovation. We announced the general availability of Sensitive Data Scanner in December. Sensitive Data Scanner gives customers an easy and cost-effective method to discover, classify and protect sensitive information. With modern applications, data moves across many important teams, making it difficult to know when services are storing sensitive data. This is particularly important for enterprises in regulated industries like health care or financial services. Sensitive Data Scanner is available today for log management, and we'll be working to extend it into other areas of the platform in 2022.\nWe also announced this morning the acquisition of CoScreen, a screen-sharing platform that allows participants to interact with a joint work space in real time. Engineering is a team sport. CoScreen lets us bring individual work into a shared team environment. And unlike general purpose video conferencing tools, which are one too many and focus on presentation and conversation, CoScreen is many to many, allowing multiple participants to share and collaborate in each other's windows as if they were local applications. We believe this will help our customers in a number of use cases such as incident response and aligns with our [founding] goal of breaking down silos between teams.\nNow let's take a moment to review our accomplishments in 2021. We ended the year with 13 generally available products, up from 9 at the end of 2020. We significantly extended our visibility capabilities in 2021. In infrastructure monitoring, we made it even easier to instrument and monitor. We launched over [80] new integrations covering cloud, CDN, web platforms, automation platforms and more. We now have over 500 integrations and continue to go deeper into cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure and GCP. We launched network device monitoring for physical network devices and appliances. We created new [container-centric] views as our customers continue adopting Kubernetes at massive scale. On the serverless front, we have expanded our coverage to include visibility into not only the functions customers develop, but also the ecosystem of data, security and routing services that surround them. And we launched a beta of universal service monitoring, which captures service level health and performance without needing to modify any application code.\nOur APM suite was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant in 2021, and we doubled down on innovation in APM. We expanded Real User Monitoring meaningfully, particularly for Android and iOS mobile devices. we launched Session Replay, database monitoring and automated tracking of [faulty] deployment. We expanded Synthetic Monitoring with support of numerous new browsers and locations. In Continuous Profiler, we added support to profile many new languages such as .NET, Ruby, PHP, CC++ (sic) [C++] and Node.js. And we invested to get close with developers day-to-day experience with synthetic testing in CI pipelines [not detecting] problems before they happen in production, they are tracking now covering front-end devices and back-end services and source code integration enabling developers to tie production to the right line of code.\nIn log management, we continue to aggressively invest, providing more sophisticated analytical and governance capabilities and giving our customers more flexibility with data storage and retention. Our improvements unlock many sophisticated use cases, for example, in cybersecurity and business analysis.\nWe also announced Online Archives, a new long-term data store for extremely large data volumes. Now further expanding observability to development workflows, we launched CI Visibility to help developers ship faster and more safely. And going beyond observability, we launched our Cloud Security Platform, including Cloud SIEM, Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Workload Security. In addition to those, our application security product is currently in beta. And we're now very pleased with our early momentum in security as we have thousands of customers using our cloud security products today.\nWe also kept [opening up] Datadog as a platform with the release of Datadog apps. And finally, we'll continue to invest and innovate with Watchdog, Datadog's AI engine. Watchdog can automatically detect and [correct anomalies], and we've been busy extending Watchdog to provide information in context throughout our platform. I want to thank our engineering and product teams for their hard work and their relentless focus on our customers.\nNow moving on to sales and marketing. Earlier this month, we announced the promotion of Sean Walters to Chief Revenue Officer. This is a well-deserved promotion for Sean, who has been an enterprise sales leader at Datadog for 4 years now and have shown excellence in building strong teams and delivering high productivity. We've all been impressed with his performance over the past few quarters as well. Sean has a deep experience in the field with over 20 years of increasing responsibilities in software sales, and we are excited to see him build on his successes as CRO.\nIn addition to this, we are pleased to have received a FedRAMP moderate authorization. As a result, we can now sell to U.S. Federal Government agencies as well as the other public sector customers who use FedRAMP as an indicator of compliance and security. We have been working to build our go-to-market teams for the public sector, and we intend to expand on those efforts aggressively.\nWe also announced a global strategic partnership with AWS. This is a recognition of our success and growth with AWS and our commitment to further invest to accelerate our joint opportunities. Among the areas of further partnership, we have already integrated Datadog more tightly into the AWS marketplace. We are also working with AWS to build deeper integrations not only for observability, but also for security use cases, and we are also planning to extend our joint go-to-market activities. Meanwhile, our sales teams continue to execute at a very high level. So let's discuss some wins for Q4.\nFirst, we had a 6-year land deal with a major U.S. airline. This customer has chosen Datadog as the de facto monitoring solution for all new IT projects and applications. They plan to start with 6 products in the Datadog platform with an expectation to expand significantly with more teams and applications over time.\nNext, we had a 7-figure up-sell with a major European car company. Prior to using Datadog, this customer has 5 disparate monitoring tools, which created [focus alerts] while leaving gaps in coverage. With Datadog, they were able to break down silos between teams and reduce the frequency and duration of outages.\nNext, we had an up-sell to add figures of ARR with a major financial infrastructure company. This customer has consolidated multiple monitoring tools in Datadog, helping them ensure stability and support growth. This customer estimate savings of [45%] by migrating to Datadog. And the up-sell also includes new products such as Cloud SIEM, Cloud Workload Security and Cloud Security Posture Management. And this customer now uses 10 Datadog products.\nNext, we had a 7-figure up-sell with a multinational beverage conglomerate. This expansion makes Datadog their global observability standards with enterprise adoption across 6 international zones. Thanks to Datadog log correlation, what used to take 3 people an hour of log data gathering, now it takes 1 person less than 10 minutes.\nAnd finally, we wanted to spend some time discussing our largest-ever multimillion dollar land deal with a major media company. This media conglomerate sees massive amounts of traffic with this customer-facing content. And the most critical content such as live sports and entertainment requires highly optimized observability.\nThis customer also decided to embark upon a significant digital transformation project, eliminating these data centers over time in favor of cloud. This operational overhaul hinged on proper end-to-end observability. But the customers' existing monitoring solutions failed to innovate quickly enough to support his growth and increasing complexity.\nIn addition, reliance in open-source tooling was a strain on engineering resources. Datadog provided a single integrated cloud solution, and the customer plans to replace 8 different commercial [open source] tools with the Datadog platform, starting with 5 of our products. So as you can see, our go-to-market teams are successfully helping both new and existing customers get value out of Datadog. And I want to congratulate them for their incredible work this quarter.\nNow looking ahead to 2022 and beyond. We continue to see digital transformation and cloud migration as critical for our existing and prospective customers. The cloud and other next-gen technologies are creating complexity that customers need to understand and manage. Meanwhile, security threats can occur anywhere in this broad and dynamic set of infrastructure and applications, making identifying vulnerability and attacks absolutely crucial.\nSo there's a lot of demand out there for observability and security for modern stack. As a result, we continue to feel that we are still very early with respect to our products and our market opportunity. And looking forward to 2022, we will make further progress in expanding the Datadog platform. We have a lot to do, and we're excited about what's in front of us.\nOn a final note, we feel that 2021 was a very successful year for Datadog, which we recognize, and it's been a tough time for many others. This is why we're happy to report that together with our employees, Datadog donated over $3 million to nonprofit global organizations at the end of the year, and we look forward to giving back more to our communities in 2022.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to our CFO for a review of financial performance and guidance. David?\n\nDavid M. Obstler\n\nCFO, Datadog, Inc.\n\nThanks, Olivier. In summary, we had a very strong Q4 and fiscal year 2021. Revenue was $326 million, up 84% year-over-year and up 21% quarter-over-quarter. Usage growth with our existing customers exceeded our expectations. Customers are finding value from adopting more products on our platform. And new logo ARR grew robustly in Q4.\nLet's go into some more of the details. First, growth of existing customers was strong in Q4. And our dollar-based net retention rate remained above 130% for the 18th consecutive quarter.\nUsage growth was very strong. Our customers expanded the usage of our largest products meaningfully. Infrastructure monitoring year-over-year ARR growth accelerated from Q3 levels. And the APM suite and log management products remain in hyper-growth mode. And our newer products are all growing very rapidly.\nWe also saw strong ARR growth in each geographical region. North America, EMEA and APAC all accelerated on a year-over-year basis compared to Q3. Our go-to-market teams delivered a strong quarter in new logos and new logo ARR. We added 1,300 customers sequentially, a new record for us. And new logo ARR was also a record and included our largest ARR land ever, as Olivier discussed earlier.\nRemember that given our usage-based revenue model, new logo wins generally do not immediately translate into meaningful revenue. Our platform strategy continues to resonate with customers with 78% of our customers using 2 or more products, 33% using 4 or more products and 10% using 6 or more Datadog products as of the end of Q4.\nFinally, churn has remained low. Our dollar-based gross retention rate has gradually improved over the years and is now in the mid- to high 90s, and it's similar across customer segments and major products.\nTurning to billings. Billings were $408 million, up 86% year-over-year. Billings duration in Q4 were similar to the year ago quarter and within the range we've seen historically. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $815 million, up 88% year-over-year. And contract duration was similar to the year ago quarter.\nCurrent RPO growth was over 80% year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indicator of our business trends than billings and RPO as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.\nNow let's review the income statement. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nGross profit in the quarter was $262 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. This compares to a gross margin of 78% last quarter and also 78% in the year ago quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we saw efficiencies in cloud costs reflected in our cost of goods sold in the quarter. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to remain in the high 70s range.\nOperating income was $71 million or a 22% operating margin compared to an operating income of $18 million with a 10% margin in the year ago quarter. We are experiencing significant business efficiencies on strong revenue growth. This is occurring despite continued aggressive investments in our long-term opportunities, particularly in R&D and go-to-market. Finally, in Q4, we hosted our Dash user conference virtually and a strong presence at AWS re:Invent.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. And cash flow from operations was a strong $116 million in the quarter. After taking into account -- taking into consideration CapEx and capitalized software, free cash flow was $107 million with a free cash flow margin of 33%.\nI want to briefly summarize our fiscal 2021 results. Revenue was $1.03 billion, up 70% year-over-year. We generated $165 million positive in operating income for a 16% operating margin compared to $64 billion with an 11% operating margin in 2020. And we generated $251 million in free cash flow at a 24% margin in 2021 compared to $83 million at a 14% margin in 2020. I want to thank all Datadog employees for their hard work and strong execution throughout 2021.\nNow for our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022. We continue to believe we are in early days of our opportunity in observability. And we are at the very beginning of our potential in-cloud security and developer-focused observability. At 18,800 customers, we believe we are still very early in our penetration of potential customers worldwide, and we see opportunities broadly across industries and customer sizes.\nAs we look on to 2022, we believe companies have learned to manage around the potential business disruptions and remote work life over the past couple of years. And we believe that the need for companies to embark upon digital transformation and cloud migration projects is higher than ever in our strategic imperative to drive competitive advantage. So we are initiating our fiscal 2022 guidance, which includes continued high growth.\nWith our usual conservatism applied, our outlook is as follows. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $334 million to $339 million, which represents 70% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $36 million to $41 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the $0.10 to $0.12 range per share based on approximately 348 million weighted average diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $180 million. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.51 per share at approximately 350 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nAnd now some notes on the guidance. As usual, when providing guidance, we use more conservative assumptions than we have seen in our historical results. Our strategic focus remains to invest aggressively in R&D and go-to-market to optimize for our long-term growth.\nNext, our model assumes greater expenses related to travel and in-person events going forward, but we remain flexible depending on further COVID developments, and our highest priority is protecting the health of our employees.\nFinally, as it relates to our capital expenditures, we are catching up on office build-outs and expect CapEx as a percent of sales to roughly double compared to 2021. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in Q4 and 2021. We continue to innovate rapidly and broaden our platform capabilities with many more products planned to be launched in 2022. We have grown our go-to-market opportunities, including in the public sector with our FedRAMP moderate authorization and deepening our relationships with our cloud partners. And across the company, we are working hard to execute against our opportunities in 2022 and beyond.\nAnd with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."

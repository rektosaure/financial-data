We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our website.\nNow I'm happy to turn the call over to CEO, Paul Shoukry. Paul?\n\nPaul Marone Shoukry\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nThank you, Kristi. Good evening. Thank you all for joining us. I'm very pleased to report record results for both the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 this evening. And while the financial results are critically important, it's more than just numbers to us. It's a deep personal relationships our advisers, bankers and associates have with their clients, which is a foundation to providing tailored financial advice. It's a long-standing values of the firm, always putting clients first, making decisions for the long term, having integrity and valuing independence, which guide all of the decisions that we make.\nThese values, the personal relationships and the differentiated financial advice across our diverse and complementary businesses contributed to our fifth consecutive year of record revenues and record net income in very different market environments.\nAs we look ahead, many of our key business drivers also ended the year at record levels, including record client assets of $1.73 trillion, a record number of financial advisers of 8,943, record trailing 12 production for recruited financial advisers of $407 million and record net bank loans of $51.6 billion.\nWe also have healthy pipelines for growth, including strong levels of adviser commitments to join over the coming year and strong investment banking pipelines. And importantly, we have the regulatory capital capacity and plenty of liquidity to support this growth.\nThroughout the fiscal year, we have continued to develop and maintain industry-leading technology for our financial advisers, once again making significant investments of approximately $1 billion in technology. These investments include strategic AI initiatives designed to improve adviser efficiency and support regulatory oversight with the emphasis on enhancing the adviser and client experience.\nWe filled new technology positions of Chief AI Officer and Head of AI Strategy to lead our development and implementation, which includes bringing experienced talent and fresh perspectives.\nDuring the year, we earned the highest ranking for investor satisfaction among those working with a dedicated financial adviser or team of advisers. Importantly, we were also recognized as the most trusted company among advised investors in wealth management in the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Investor Satisfaction Study.\nIn response to growing demand for private investment product alternatives for ultra-high net worth clients, we further developed the firm's private capital-raising expertise and broaden bespoke private investment alternatives for such clients.\nI'm proud of our many accomplishments this year and believe we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, our people and technology to drive growth across all our businesses.\nTurning to our financial results for the quarter. The firm's values-based client-focused approach continues to generate steady performance. Quarterly net revenues of $3.7 billion grew 8% over the prior year quarter and 10% over the preceding quarter.\nPretax income of $731 million declined 4% compared to the year ago quarter and increased 30% from the preceding quarter. For fiscal 2025, we generated record net revenues of $14.1 billion, representing 10% growth and record pretax income of $2.71 billion, up 3% over fiscal 2024.\nThese strong results were attributable to our diverse and complementary businesses anchored by the Private Client Group and augmented with the capital markets, asset management and bank segments.\nAcross our businesses, we continue to achieve success retaining and recruiting financial professionals who provide high-quality advice to their clients. In the Private Client Group, we ended the quarter with a record $1.6 trillion of client assets under administration, representing year-over-year growth of 11%.\nWe had an outstanding year recruiting high-quality advisers onto our platform, a testament to our unique service first culture, comprehensive capabilities and strong balance sheet.\nIn fiscal year 2025, we had record recruiting results of financial advisers to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels. With recruiting trailing 12-month production at their previous firms totaling $407 million, reflecting a 21% increase over last year's previous record. These recruited advisers had approximately $58 billion of client assets at the previous firms, also surpassing last year's record.\nIncluding assets recruited into our RIA and custody services division, we recruited total client assets over the past 12 months of nearly $63 billion across all of our platforms. Quarterly domestic net new assets were nearly $18 billion this quarter, representing a 5% annualized growth rate.\nWe ended the fiscal year with a record number of financial advisers, 2% higher than the prior year and a reflection of solid adviser retention as well as strong recruiting results.\nBased on our robust adviser recruiting pipeline and strong level of commitments to join in the coming quarters, we continue to be optimistic about our momentum and growth. Our best of both world's value proposition, where we offer a unique combination of an adviser and client-focused culture, coupled with leading technology and solutions, continues to resonate with advisers across all of our affiliation options. Additionally, our strong balance sheet and commitment to independence is proving to be a differentiator for advisers evaluating alternatives.\nTo continue retaining and attracting the best advisers, we continue to make investments in our platform and offerings. For example, our private wealth adviser program offers education, training and accreditation along with enhanced capabilities and product solutions. This enables advisers to meet the needs of their most sophisticated clients and create significant value for our advisers who progress through this rigorous program.\nWe continue to make investments and implement solutions to automate and streamline processes, which in turn frees associates and advisers to do what they do best, which is to engage in human-to-human and deepened personal relationships, add more value and importantly, have more capacity to grow their businesses by attracting new clients.\nThe Capital Markets segment delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, achieving revenues that represented the third highest level on record, surpassed only by those observed during the pandemic period. This strength demonstrates the potential resulting from the strategic investments we have made in this segment over the past few years. The fourth quarter results were underpinned by solid performance throughout all of our capital markets businesses.\nLooking ahead, the investment banking pipeline remains strong. We are confident that we are well positioned with motivated buyers and sellers, along with deep expertise across the industries we cover.\nWe remain committed to continuing to enhance the platform by broadening and deepening our capabilities, whether through strategic hiring or acquisitions. For example, over the past 2 years, we've hired a number of experienced public finance investment bankers, which provided us growth opportunities across a number of domestic markets. We began to realize the returns on some of those investments as evidenced by our fourth quarter results.\nAs it pertains to acquisitions, we recently announced the acquisition of GreensLedge, a boutique investment bank recognized for its expertise in structured credit and securitizations and the transaction we anticipate should close later this fiscal year. Notably, GreensLedge differentiates itself with deep relationships and expertise while operating on a balance sheet light model.\nIn the Asset Management segment, net inflows into managed fee-based programs in the Private Client Group was strong during the quarter, annualizing at over 7% and reflect the complementary impact of being able to offer high-quality investment alternatives to our financial advisers as well as growth resulting from our successful recruiting efforts.\nIn the bank segment, loans ended the quarter at a record $51.6 billion, primarily reflecting robust 22% annual growth in securities-based lending balances, yet another synergistic impact from our growing Private Client Group business, as we are able to deploy our strong balance sheet in support of the clients. Importantly, the credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong.\nTurning to capital deployment. Our long-standing priorities have remained unchanged, and that starts with investing in growth first organically and complemented with strategic acquisitions.\nWe continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria of being a strong cultural fit, a good strategic fit and at valuations that would generate attractive returns for our shareholders.\nAs we continue to pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities, we also maintained our share repurchase program to effectively manage capital levels. As outlined in recent quarters, our capital deployment strategy is to repurchase shares on a consistent basis at a level which barring new development should keep our Tier 1 leverage ratio from growing beyond current levels.\nWe continue to operate that guidance this quarter as we repurchased $350 million of common stock at an average share price of $166. We ended the quarter with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 13.1%. In fiscal 2025, we returned capital of over $1.5 billion through common dividends and share repurchases.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Butch Oorlog to review our financial results in detail. Butch?\n\nJonathan W. Oorlog\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Controller\n\nThank you, Paul. I'll begin on Slide 6. The firm reported net revenues of $3.7 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter. Net income available to common shareholders was $603 million with earnings per diluted share of $2.95. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders equaled $635 million, resulting in adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.11 and our adjusted pretax margin was 20.7%. We generated annualized return on common equity of 19.6% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 23.9%. Solid results for the quarter, particularly given our conservative capital base.\nTurning to Slide 7. Private Client Group generated pretax income of $416 million on record quarterly net revenues of $2.66 billion. Results were driven by higher PCG assets under administration compared to the previous year, the result of market appreciation, retention and the consistent addition of net new assets.\nPretax income declined year-over-year, primarily due to interest rate reductions totaling 125 basis points since September of 2024.\nOur Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $513 million and a pretax income of $90 million. Net revenues grew 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher debt underwriting, strong growth in affordable housing investments business revenues as well as solid improvements in both equity and fixed income brokerage revenues.\nSequential results grew a robust 35% largely due to higher M&A revenues, underwriting and affordable housing investments revenues. The Asset Management segment generated record pretax income of $132 million on net revenues of $314 million.\nResults were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation over the 12-month period and strong net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts. We had strong net inflows of approximately $3.6 billion or 7.3% annualized growth rate into managed programs on our platform.\nThe Asset Management segment generated record revenues and pretax income in the fiscal year. The Bank segment generated net revenues of $459 million and pretax income of $133 million. On a sequential basis, the bank segment net interest income was up slightly, primarily driven by continued loan growth. The September 2025 rate cut had minimal effect on our fourth quarter.\nTurning to consolidated revenues on Slide 8. Fourth quarter net revenues grew 8% over the year ago period and 10% sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees of $1.88 billion grew 13% over the prior year and 8% over the preceding quarter. Record PCG fee-based assets equaled $1.01 trillion at quarter end, up 15% year-over-year and 7% over the preceding quarter.\nAs we look ahead, we expect fiscal first quarter 2026 asset management and related administrative fees to be higher by approximately 6.5% over the fourth quarter level, driven by higher PCG assets and fee-based accounts at quarter end.\nBrokerage revenues of $616 million grew 8% year-over-year, mainly due to higher PCG revenues. Investment Banking revenues of $316 million were nearly flat with the year ago quarter and increased 49% sequentially. The sequential increase was driven by significant increases in M&A and advisory revenues, along with robust results in debt underwriting, which were in part from large private placement transactions where frequency and magnitude are unpredictable as well as an increase in public finance activity in the quarter.\nAffordable housing investment results reported in other revenues, grew $25 million sequentially in what is typically a seasonally strong fiscal fourth quarter, but also reflected a 19% increase in fiscal year revenues, demonstrating continued growth of the business.\nMoving to Slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at $56.4 billion, up 2% over the preceding quarter and representing 3.7% of domestic PCG client assets. Balances increased $2.2 billion or 4% in the month of September, growing nicely after fee billings had resulted in anticipated decreases earlier in the quarter.\nBased on October activity to date, domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances have declined as anticipated, given October's record quarterly fee billings of approximately $1.8 billion.\nTurning to Slide 10. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $653 million, down slightly from the prior quarter. Net interest margin in the bank segment decreased 3 basis points to 2.71% for the quarter.\nThe average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks decreased 5 basis points to 2.91% in part due to the impact of the September Fed interest rate cut. Based on current interest rates, including the full quarter impact of the September rate cut, in quarter end balances net of the $1.8 billion fiscal first quarter fee billings, we would expect the aggregate of NII and RJBDP third-party fees in the first quarter to be approximately flat with the fourth quarter level. This is largely the result of the positive impact of a higher interest earning asset balance as of the September starting point offsetting the full quarter impact of the September Fed rate action.\nKeep in mind, there are many variables which could influence actual results, including any interest rate actions during the upcoming quarter and factors affecting our balance sheet, including changes in our loan and deposit balances.\nTurning to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. Compensation expense was $2.39 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 64.2%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the adjusted compensation ratio was 64.0%, better than the 65% target level we shared at our Investor Day.\nIn fiscal year 2025, adjusted compensation expense included the amortization of transition assistance provided to recruited advisers and other retention awards to existing advisers in the aggregate amount of $355 million, representing an increase of approximately 11% compared to fiscal 2024.\nNon-compensation expenses of $602 million increased 11% over the year ago quarter. A large portion of these costs support firm-wide growth initiatives, such as adviser recruiting, professional fees associated with investment banking activity and higher investment sub-advisory fee expense.\nFor the fiscal year, consistent with our prior guidance, we achieved full year non-compensation expenses of approximately $2.1 billion, excluding the bank loan provision for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items and non-GAAP adjustments presented in our non-GAAP financial measures.\nA strong result, given our continued investments in technology, as well as the higher growth-related costs we incurred. We remain committed to investing to support growth across the business while maintaining discipline over controllable expenses.\nOn Slide 12, we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment. We grew loans during the quarter by 3%, primarily in support of our clients with this loan growth continuing to be led by our securities-based loans, which grew 22% and residential mortgage loans, which grew 9% over the year. These 2 loan categories represent nearly 60% of our total loan book, reflecting 38% and 20% of the total.\nThe credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment were 1.28% at quarter end and nonperforming assets remained low at 29 basis points of bank segment assets. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 88 basis points. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was 1.88%. We believe the total allowance represents an appropriate reserve but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may affect our loan portfolios.\nSlide 13 represents the pretax margin trends for the past 5 quarters, highlighting the stability and strength of our diversified businesses and consistently achieving strong margins. During the fiscal fourth quarter, the adjusted pretax margin reached 20.7%. For the full fiscal year, we attained an adjusted pretax margin of 20%, successfully meeting our target margin objective.\nOn Slide 14, at quarter end, our total assets were $88.2 billion, a 4% sequential increase, resulting primarily from loan growth and higher corporate cash balances.\nWe continue to have strong levels of liquidity and capital. During the quarter, to take advantage of a favorable market environment, reflecting very tight credit spreads and attractive benchmark yields, the firm issued $1.5 billion of senior notes with the mix of 10-year and 30-year maturities as well as amending and extending the maturity of the revolving credit facility. These actions resulted in additional liquidity on hand for deployment in our growth and to meet client needs as well as providing additional capacity in our committed borrowing facility should the need arise over the next 5 years.\nRJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $3.7 billion, $2.5 billion over our target level of $1.2 billion, an increase over the prior quarter level, resulting from the proceeds of the senior notes offering.\nOur capital levels provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic in our pursuit of strategic acquisitions and to invest in organic growth. With a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 13.1% and a total capital ratio of 24.1%, we remain well above regulatory requirements with approximately $2.6 billion of excess capital capacity to deploy before reaching our targeted Tier 1 capital ratio of 10%.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.4%, reflecting the favorable impact of nontaxable corporate-owned life insurance gains and the favorable resolution of certain historical tax matters in the quarter. Looking ahead, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal 2026 to be approximately 24% to 25%.\nSlide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. Through the combination of common dividends paid and share repurchases, we returned over $450 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter and more than $1.5 billion over the fiscal year. Additionally, and other debt capital actions, in August, we utilized nearly $100 million of liquidity to redeem our outstanding subordinated notes. We maintain our long-term commitment to operating our businesses at capital levels consistent with established targets.\nI'll now turn the call back to Paul for some final remarks.\n\nPaul Marone Shoukry\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nThank you. As we enter fiscal 2026, we are more confident about our competitive positioning and path forward than we have ever been. While in some ways, there's more competition in our space, we are confident that our long-standing approach is becoming increasingly differentiated and unique.\nWe are focused on the long term in providing a stable platform for our advisers, bankers and associates, where so many of our competitors are increasingly looking for an exit in 3 to 5 years or even less.\nWe attract and retain financial advisers with our unique culture, leading service and robust platform, whereas many of our competitors compete with the largest check.\nWe value independence to foster an environment where our advisers can provide objective advice to their clients, whereas many of our competitors change their comp plans every year to cross-sell more bank products.\nWe are focused on sustainable growth and quality over quantity, whereas many of our competitors are focused on growth at all costs. We strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with strong levels of capital liquidity, whereas many of our competitors have significantly higher levels of leverage.\nAs I said at the beginning of the call, this is way more than just numbers to us. We deeply value the personal relationships that we are so blessed to create in our business. We are confident our tried and tested approach will continue to endure in both good times and more challenging times and help us deliver on our vision of being the absolute best firm for financial professionals and their clients.\nSo I want to end this call by thanking our advisers, bankers and associates for the great service and advice they provide to their clients and delivering on our firm's mission to help clients achieve their financial objectives.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line with questions?"

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. I'm Kristi Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us.\nWith me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Paul Shoukry; and Chief Financial Officer, Butch Oorlog. The presentation being reviewed today is available on Raymond James' Investor Relations website. Following the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions.\nCalling your attention to Slide 2. Please note that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, industry or market conditions, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions and our level of success in integrating acquired businesses; anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments, and general economic conditions.\nIn addition, words such as believes, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, projects, forecasts and future or conditional verbs such as may, will, could, should and would as well as any other statements that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Forms 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our website.\nNow I'm happy to turn the call over to CEO, Paul Shoukry. Paul?\n\nPaul Marone Shoukry\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nThank you, Kristie. Good evening. Thank you for joining us. We are holding this call from the firm's Annual Summer Development Conference in Orlando, Florida, where financial advisers in our employee channel, along with their families, come for education, networking and activities, one of the great tradition of Raymond James and unique to our culture.\nI really enjoy being able to spend time and hear directly from such dedicated professionals. Our results this quarter marked the firm's 150th consecutive quarter of profitability. Since our inception, the firm has endured thriving in good times but also persevering through challenges, including recessions, financial crisis and events such as the pandemic and other global threats. This long-term record of resilient profitability reflects the strength of our diverse and complementary businesses and our ongoing commitment to always putting clients first.\nAs current market and macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, we continue to adhere to strategies that have supported consistent success over the past 150 quarters, guided by our vision to be the absolute best firm for financial professionals and their clients. I'm also excited to share that Raymond James has topped the J.D. Power rankings in its annual U.S. Investor Satisfaction Study as the #1 wealth management firm for advised investor satisfaction.\nThe firm also ranked as the most trusted and highest in the Study's individual metrics on people and products and services as well as strong rankings in the J.D. Power Financial Advisor satisfaction rankings in each of the employee and independent adviser surveys. This recognition is purely a reflection of all advisers, branch staff and corporate associates do every day to serve clients so well.\nSo thank you. These are well deserved owners. Turning to our financial results for the quarter. The firm's values-based client-focused approach continues to generate steady performance. Quarterly net revenues of $3.4 billion grew 5% over the prior year quarter. Pretax income of $563 million declined 13% compared to the year ago quarter. Results this quarter included a $58 million reserve increase associated with the settlement of a legal matter related to bond underwriting for specific issuer sold to institutional investors between 2013 to 2015.\nAlthough the firm maintains and has strong defenses and denied any liability, given the complexity of the case and the unpredictability of litigation outcomes, we determined to resolve the long-running dispute without admission of wrongdoing. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2025, we generated record net revenues of $10.3 billion and record pretax income of $1.98 billion, up 10% and 5% over the first 9 months of fiscal 2024. These solid results were attributable to our diverse and complementary businesses anchored by the Private Client Group and augmented with the capital markets asset management and bank segments.\nAcross our businesses, we have achieved consistent success retaining and recruiting financial professionals who provide high-quality advice to their clients. In the Private Client Group, we ended the quarter with a record $1.57 trillion of client assets under administration, representing year-over-year growth of 11%. Over the past 12 months, we recruited into our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with $336 million of [ tailing trail ] production and $52 billion of client assets at their previous firms.\nIncluding assets recruited into our RIA and Custody Services division, we recruited total client assets over the past 12 months of over $60 billion across all of our platforms. Quarterly domestic net new assets equaled $11.7 billion, representing a 3.4% annualized growth rate. We saw net new assets improved throughout the quarter, with June activity producing annualized growth in the high single-digit level. Based on our robust recruiting pipeline and strong level of commitments, we are even more optimistic about our momentum and growth over the coming quarters.\nOur best of both world's value proposition where we offer a unique combination of an adviser and client-focused culture, coupled with leading technology and solutions continues to resonate with advisers across all of our affiliation options. Additionally, our strong balance sheet and commitment to independence is increasingly becoming a differentiator as well. To continue retaining and attracting the best advisers, we are continuing to make investments in our platforms and offerings.\nFor example, in the private wealth space, we remain focused on providing education, training, accreditation and enhanced capabilities and product solutions to allow advisers to meet the needs of their most sophisticated clients. About 370 advisers have completed or enrolled in our private wealth adviser program, which continues to attract strong interest from advisers due to its client benefits and contribution to business growth.\nWe also continue to invest in technology, including AI, to drive continued operational efficiencies and improve advisers' productive capacity. We are making investments to automate and streamline processes, which in turn frees up associates and advisers to do what they do best, which is to engage human-to-human and deepen relationships, add more value and importantly, have more capacity to grow their businesses by attracting new clients.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline is strong. And we are becoming more optimistic about macroeconomic conditions relative to the near term, although the environment remains uncertain. However, we are confident that we are well positioned with motivated buyers and sellers along with deep expertise across the industries we cover whenever the market does become more conducive. We remain committed to enhancing the platform by broadening and deepening its capabilities, whether through strategic hiring or acquisitions.\nIn the Asset Management segment, net inflows into managed fee-based programs in the Private Client Group were strong during the quarter, annualizing at nearly 5% and reflecting the complementary impact of our successful recruiting efforts. In the bank segment, loans ended the quarter at a record $49.8 billion, primarily reflecting strong growth in securities-based lending balances, yet another synergistic impact from our growing Private Client Group business as we are able to deploy our strong balance sheet in support of our clients.\nImportantly, the credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong. Turning to capital deployment. Our long-standing priorities have remained unchanged, and that starts with investing in growth. First, organically and complemented with strategic acquisitions. We continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria of being a strong cultural fit, a good strategic fit and valuations that would generate attractive returns for our shareholders.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $451 million of common stock at an average share price of $137. Year-to-date, we have returned capital of over $1 billion through common dividends and share repurchases. As previously discussed in recent quarters, the capital deployment plan is to repurchase shares on a consistent basis throughout the quarter, with total amounts expected to be similar to the fiscal third quarter. This approach is expected to maintain capital liquidity levels, which provide ample capacity to fund organic growth initiatives and execute future acquisitions.\nNow I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Butch Oorlog to review our financial results in detail. Butch?\n\nJonathan W. Oorlog\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Controller\n\nThank you, Paul. I'll begin on Slide 6. The firm reported net revenues of $3.4 billion for the fiscal third quarter. Net income available to common shareholders was $435 million with earnings per diluted share of $2.12. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders equaled $449 million resulting in adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.19, and our adjusted pretax margin was 17.1%. We generated annualized return on common equity of 14.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 17.2%.\nSolid results for the quarter, particularly given our conservative capital base. Turning to Slide 7. Private Client Group generated pretax income of $411 million on quarterly net revenues of $2.49 billion. Results were driven by higher PCG assets under administration compared to the previous year, the result of market appreciation and the consistent addition of net new assets.\nPretax income declined year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. Fiscal year-to-date, PCG generated record revenues. Our Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $381 million and a pretax loss of $54 million. Net revenues grew 15% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher investment banking, fixed income and equity brokerage revenues. However, sequential results declined 4%, largely due to lower M&A and fixed income brokerage revenues, which were partially offset by higher underwriting and affordable housing investments revenues.\nPretax income was negatively impacted by the $58 million legal reserve increase previously described. The Asset Management segment generated record pretax income of $125 million on net revenues of $291 million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation over the 12-month period and strong net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts.\nWe had strong net inflows of approximately $2.1 billion into managed programs on our platform. The Asset Management segment generated record revenues and pretax income fiscal year-to-date. The Bank segment generated net revenues of $458 million and pretax income of $123 million. On a sequential basis, Bank segment net interest income grew 5%, driven by continued loan growth and a 7 basis point expansion of net interest margin to 2.74%, resulting from a favorable shift in asset mix along with a higher portion of lower cost deposits.\nTurning to consolidated revenues on Slide 8. Third quarter net revenues grew 5% over the prior year and were flat sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees of $1.73 billion grew 8% over the prior year and were slightly higher than the preceding quarter. Record PCG fee-based assets equaled $944 billion at quarter end, up 15% year-over-year and 8% over the preceding quarter.\nAs we look ahead, we expect fourth quarter asset management and related administrative fees to be higher by approximately 9% over the third quarter, primarily due to higher PCG assets and fee-based accounts at quarter end and one more business day during the quarter. Brokerage revenues of $559 million grew 5% year-over-year due to higher revenues in Capital Markets and PCG.\nInvestment Banking revenues of $212 million increased 16% year-over-year and declined 2% sequentially. The sequential decline reflected lower M&A and advisory revenues, while underwriting and affordable housing investments results were higher in the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 9. Client domestic cash suite and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at $55.2 billion, down 4% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 3.8% of domestic PCG client assets. Program balances increased by nearly $1 billion in the month of June after seasonal declines for client tax payments and fee billings resulted in decreases early in the quarter.\nIn July, domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances have declined to date, in line with July's record quarterly fee billings of approximately $1.7 billion. Turning to Slide 10. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks increased 1% to $656 million as the decline in RJBDP third-party fees was more than offset by higher net interest income.\nNet interest margin in the bank segment grew 7 basis points to 2.74% for the quarter, the result of the factors I described earlier. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks decreased 4 basis points to 2.96% primarily due to deployment of incremental cash suite program balances from third-party banks on to the bank segment balance sheet.\nBased on current interest rates and quarter end balances, net of fourth quarter fee billings, we would expect the aggregate of NII in RJBDP third-party fees to decline approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, largely the result of the lower beginning of the quarter, sweep balances held by third-party banks. Keep in mind, there are many variables which will influence actual results, including any interest rate actions during the upcoming quarter and factors affecting our balance sheet, including changes in our loan and deposit balances.\nTurning to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 64.8%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the adjusted compensation ratio was 64.5%, better than our 65% target recently shared at our Investor Day, a good result, especially in a challenging capital markets environment.\nNoncompensation expenses of $633 million increased 20% sequentially. Adjusting for the previously mentioned legal matter reserve in the quarter, noncompensation expenses of $633 million increased 20% sequentially. Adjusting for the previously mentioned legal matter reserve in the quarter, noncompensation expenses were $575 million, up 9% sequentially. While the third quarter typically experiences higher seasonal costs related to conferences and events, a large portion of this quarterly increase also supports firm-wide growth initiatives, including adviser recruiting, professional fees associated with increased underwriting activity and higher investment sub-advisory fee expense.\nThrough the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we are on track with our guidance for full year noncompensation expenses of approximately $2.1 billion, excluding the bank loan provision for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items and non-GAAP adjustments presented in our non-GAAP financial measures.\nOn Slide 12, we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment. We grew loans during the quarter by 3%, primarily in support of our clients with this loan growth continuing to be led by a securities-based lending and residential mortgage loan growth. These 2 loan categories represent well over half of our total loan book, reflecting 36% and 20% of the total. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment were stable at 1.14% at quarter end, and nonperforming assets remained low at 34 basis points of bank segment assets.\nThe bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 93 basis points, consistent with the prior quarter level. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was 1.96%. We believe the total allowance represents an appropriate reserve but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may affect our loan portfolios.\nSlide 13 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters, which demonstrates the resilience of our diverse business mix and its ability to consistently deliver strong margins. Adjusting for the legal matter reserve impacting the quarter, as well as acquisition-related expenses, our pretax margin would be approximately 19%, slightly below our target of 20% adjusted pretax margin, largely due to the challenging capital markets environment.\nWe remain committed to investing to support growth across the business, while maintaining discipline over controllable expenses. On Slide 14, at quarter end, our total assets were $84.8 billion, a 2% sequential increase resulting primarily from loan growth. Liquidity and capital each remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at approximately $2.3 billion well above our $1.2 billion target with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 13.1% and a total capital ratio of 24.3%, we remain well above regulatory requirements. Our capital levels provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic in our pursuit of strategic acquisitions and to invest in organic growth. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, reflecting the favorable impact of nontaxable corporate-owned life insurance gains that arose during the quarter.\nFor the fiscal year 2025, we estimate our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 24%. Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. We returned over $550 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter and nearly $1.8 billion over the past 5 quarters through either common dividends paid or share repurchases. We remain committed over the long term to operate our businesses at capital levels in line with our stated targets. I'll now turn the call back to Paul for some final remarks.\n\nPaul Marone Shoukry\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nAs we enter the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the strong tailwinds arising from fee-based assets up 8%, net loans higher by 3% and strong pipelines for growth across our businesses. Our adviser recruiting pipeline is growing significantly across all of our affiliation options, a testament to our unique culture and robust platform that is resonating with advisers. .\nWe are laser focused on providing a seamless transition as advisers affiliate with our platform, while importantly, maintaining excellent service levels to existing advisers and their clients. While the investment banking environment is uncertain based on the current pipeline and activity levels, we believe the next 2 quarters should be better than the prior 2.\nLastly, we have plenty of capital to support organic growth and acquisitions as well as continued share repurchases at a level similar to this quarter. As illustrated by our recent J.D. Power #1 rankings, putting clients first has been the cornerstone of Raymond James' value since our inception and that commitment remains at the center of everything we do. This prestigious honor demonstrates the strength of our client-centric culture and our steadfast dedication to supporting advisers and empowering them with sophisticated resources support and technology.\nOur results reflect the many contributions of our associates and advisers and financial professionals across the firm. Thank you for contributing to 150 quarters of consecutive profitability by providing outstanding advice and service to your clients. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. I'm Kristina Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us.\nWith me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Paul Shire; and Chief Financial Officer, Rich Orla. The presentation being reviewed today is available on our Investor Relations website following the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions. Calling your attention to Slide 2. Please note that certain statements made during the call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning futures, strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, industry or market conditions, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions or our level of success in integrating acquired business anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments and general economic fission.\nIn addition, words such as believes, expects, [ insulated ], plans, estimates, projects, forecasts or future or additional verbs such as may, will, could, should and would as well as any other statements that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Please note that there could be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in these statements. We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our website.\nNow I'm happy to turn the call over to CEO, Paul Shoukry. Paul?\n\nPaul Marone Shoukry\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nThank you, Kristina. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. Last week, our global top financial adviser conference in Montreal. It was wonderful to spend time with our top advisers across our affiliation options from the U.S., Canada and the U.K. They are extremely pleased with James expressing a deep appreciation for our unique adviser and client-focused culture along with our robust platform. .\nJust to be prior, we hosted all of our investment banking managing directors in Tampa and they also conveyed enthusiasm for our unique combination of value and capabilities that enable them to best serve clients. Since the CEO succession announcement last year, I have been spending a large portion of my time traveling to meet with as many advisers, bankers, associates and clients as possible. I know I've shared this before, but what I continue to hear with passion from advisers, bankers and associates is the best professional decision that they ever made was joining Raymond James. And the biggest regret they have is they did enjoy several years earlier. That statement is really a testament to our special culture and all the fantastic associates who provide excellent service to each day. Every now and then, we get external validation of this.\nFor example, this quarter, our advisers earned the #1 ranking in the 2025 J.D. Power survey for advice, investor satisfaction and industry trust to all of our advisers and the associates who support those advisers congratulations, and thank you for earning this well-deserved recognition. My #1 goal as CEO will be to reinforce and strengthen our unique culture that was established by Bob and Tom James and fortified by Paul Reilly and I am so fortunate to have a top-notch leadership team will share the same commitment.\nOur values-based client-first approach has consistently led to some results and that was the case again in the fiscal second quarter. We generated quarterly net revenues of $3.4 billion and pretax income of $671 million, up 9% and 10% over the year ago quarter, respectively. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2025, we generated record net revenues of $6.9 billion and record pretax income of $1.4 billion, up 13% and 15% over the first half of fiscal 2024. We -- these solid results were attributable to our diverse and complementary businesses, anchored by the Private Client Group and augmented with the capital markets, asset management and bank segments. Across all of our businesses, we have achieved consistent success retaining and recruiting financial professionals who provide high-quality financial advice to their clients.\nIn the Private Client Group, we ended the quarter with $1.54 trillion of client assets under administration, representing year-over-year growth of 6%. Over the past 12 months, we recruited into our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $316 million of trailing 12-month production and $50 billion of client assets at their previous firms.\nIncluding assets recruited into our RIA and Customer Services division, we recruited total client assets over the past 12 months of nearly $59 billion across all of our platforms. Quarterly domestic net new assets equaled $8.8 billion representing a 2.6% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets. While NNA was lower this quarter, which was similar to what we experienced in the same quarter in fiscal 2024, we saw net new assets improved throughout the quarter and also had extremely strong months of new commits in March and April which should help our net new assets in the second half of the fiscal year. So we are very optimistic about our momentum and growing pipeline across all of our affiliation options.\nOur best of both world's value proposition where we offer a unique combination of an adviser and client-focused culture, coupled with leading technology and solutions continues to resonate with advisers across all of our affiliation options. In the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline is very strong but the timing of closings has been negatively impacted with market uncertainty and heightened volatility associated with tariff negotiations while investment banking closings are expected to remain challenged across the industry until we get more certainty, we are confident that we are well positioned with motivated buyers and sellers along with deep expertise across the industries we cover when the market becomes more conducive.\nIn the Asset Management segment, net inflows into managed fee-based programs in the Private Client Group were very strong during the quarter, annualizing at 8%. In the bank segment, loans ended the quarter had a record $48.3 billion. Primarily reflecting strong growth in securities-based lending balances. Most importantly, the credit quality of the loan portfolio remains solid. Turning to capital deployment. I want to reiterate that our long-standing priorities have remained unchanged, and that starts with investing in growth first organically and complemented with strategic acquisitions.\nOn last quarter's call, we explained that we are evaluating a few M&A opportunities. We also explained that those opportunities are often part of competitive processes and that we would not stretch on valuation, especially if we do not have conviction that we could generate strong risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders at those prices. At this point, we are no longer pursuing those unmermentioned opportunities. While we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria of being a strong cultural fit, a good strategic fit and at valuations that would generate attractive returns for our shareholders. Given our strong capital and liquidity positions in what we believe are attractive long-term returns from buying back our own stock at the current level, we have resumed share repurchases.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of common stock at an average share price of $146. Additionally, so far in April, we repurchased another $190 million of shares at an average price of $125 per share. Our current plan is to continue repurchasing shares on a more consistent basis, likely at an amount greater than the $250 million we repurchased in the fiscal second quarter. We believe this balanced and more consistent approach will still leave us with ample capital liquidity to support our strong organic growth initiatives as well as to continue pursuing attractive acquisitions.\nIn any way, the heightened market volatility and potential economic impacts associated with tariffs it created a highly uncertain market environment. A client sentiment on the markets and economy has declined significantly over the past quarter the silver lining is clients are still confident with their financial plans and satisfaction with their adviser 97% at Raymond James. These trends highlight the fact that clients really value having a financial adviser to help them navigate these uncertain times, a similar dynamic that we experienced during the COVID-pandemic.\nDuring these times, our vision will remain unchanged to be the absolute best firm for financial professionals and their clients. In addition to our unique culture and robust platform, our strong balance sheet becomes increasingly important to prospective advisers who are seeking strength and stability for their businesses and their clients during these periods of stress. As I explained earlier, our adviser recruiting pipelines are strong and building rapidly across our affiliation options. We are also making significant investments to further strengthen our capabilities.\nFor example, during the quarter, we established and filled a new role for the [indiscernible] our leadership team has conviction that AI will be a game changer for our industry. But we also know that it's still too early to know exactly how that will play out over the coming years. So we established this dedicated function to monitor developments and use cases for AI with the goal of deploying it to help our financial professionals serve their clients more effectively and efficiently. We already used AI in many areas, primarily in the back office. And just last week, we rolled out an in-house proprietary AI search tool, which has been very well received. As an industry, we are still in the early stages of utilizing the AI, but we are excited and well prepared to expand AI utilization for financial professionals and their clients in the future.\nDuring the quarter, we also announced a new leadership structure for our private capital business to help high net worth focus advisers better serve their clients with a wide variety of bespoke private investment alternatives. These are just a couple of examples of initiatives we are pursuing to continue investing in our platform for advisers and their clients. I look forward to our Analyst Investor Day in June, where we will discuss these initiatives and others in more detail. In summary, while there is significant macro uncertainty, our value strategy and approach will remain largely unchanged, and our strong balance sheet should position us relatively well in any market environment. Now I'll turn the call over to Butch Oorlog to review our financial results in more detail. Butch?\n\nJonathan W. Oorlog\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Controller\n\nThank you, Paul. Let me go on Slide 6. The firm reported net revenues of $3.4 billion for the fiscal second quarter, pretax income of $671 million, resulting in a pretax margin of 19.7%. The net income available to common shareholders was $493 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.36. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders equal $507 million, an adjusted pretax margin of 20.3% and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.42. We generated annualized return on common equity of 16.4%. And annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 19.7%. Strong results for the quarter, particularly given our conservative capital base. .\nTurning to Slide 7. Private Client Group generated pretax income of $431 million on quarterly net revenues of $2.49 billion. Results were driven by 6% higher PCG assets under administration compared to the previous year the result of market appreciation and the consistent addition of net new assets. Fiscal year-to-date, PCG generated record revenues and pretax income. Our Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $396 million and pretax income of $36 million. Net revenues grew 23% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenues.\nHowever, sequential results declined 18% largely due to the lower investment banking revenues. The Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $121 million on net revenues, $289 million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation over the 12-month period and strong net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts. Sequentially, although market values declined we had strong net inflows of approximately $3.7 billion into managed programs on our platform. The Asset Management segment generated record revenues and pretax income fiscal year-to-date. The bank segment generated net revenues of $434 million and pretax income of $117 million.\nOn a sequential bank segment net interest income grew 1%, driven by continued loan growth and a 7 basis point expansion of net interest margin to 2.67%, resulting from a favorable shift in asset mix along with a higher portion of lower cost deposits. Turning to consolidated revenues on Slide 8. Second quarter net revenues grew 9% over the prior year and declined 4% sequentially. The Asset Management related administrative fees of $1.73 million grew 14% over the prior year and decreased 1% compared to the preceding quarter. The sequential decline was primarily due to fewer billing days in the quarter.\nPCG fee-based assets equaled $873 billion at quarter end, up 9% year-over-year and slightly lower compared to the preceding quarter. As we look ahead, we expect third quarter asset management and related administrative fees, to be relatively flat with the second quarter. Although PCG assets and fee-based accounts are slightly lower sequentially at quarter end, the third quarter will benefit from 1 additional billing day in the quarter. [indiscernible] revenues of $580 million grew 10% year-over-year primarily due to higher fixed income brokerage revenues. Despite these strong results in our second quarter, the fixed income market at the start of the third quarter is challenging as market and interest rate uncertainty of a significant headwind for the business near term.\nOur revenues in this business could be unfavorably impacted while this uncertainty persist. Investment banking revenues of $216 million increased 21% year-over-year but declined 34% sequentially. The sequential decline reflected lower investment banking activity broadly. As you may remember, the prior quarter reflected near record M&A results. Moving to Slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at $51.8 billion, down 3% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 4.2% of domestic PCG client assets. Domestic cash suite and enhanced savings program balances have decreased so far this fiscal quarter, not surprising given the timing of tax payments with the current program balance aligning with April's quarterly fee billings of approximately $1.5 billion. Turning to Slide 10. Combined net interest income and RJ BDP fees from third-party banks was $651 million, a 3% sequential decline primarily the result of 2 fewer billing days in the quarter. Net interest margin in the bank segment grew 7 basis points to [ 2.6% ] for the quarter, the result of the factors I described earlier. The average yield on RJ BDP balances with our party banks decreased 12 basis points to 3%, primarily due to the full quarter impact of rate cuts that occurred late in the preceding. Based on current interest rates and quarter end balances net of third quarter fee billings, we would expect the aggregate of NII and RJBDP third-party fees to be relatively unchanged in the fiscal third quarter. As we expect the effect of slightly lower balances in the bank deposit program to be offset by 1 additional billing day. Keep in mind, there are many variables that will impact annual results, including any interest rate actions during the upcoming quarter and factors impacting our balance sheet, including changes in our loan and deposit balances.\nTurning to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 64.8%, and excluding acquisition-related compensation expense, the adjusted compensation ratio was 64.5%. Noncompensation expenses of $528 million increased 2% sequentially, mostly due to a relatively modest bank loan provision for credit losses compared to the prior quarter where the provision was near 0 and higher communications and information processing expenses. Through the first half of the fiscal year, we are on track for full year noncompensation expenses of approximately $2.1 billion, excluding the bank loan provision for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items and non-GAAP adjustments related presented in our non-GAAP financial measures.\nImportantly, we remain committed to investing to support growth across the business while maintaining discipline over controllable expenses. On Slide 12, a we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment. We grew loans during the quarter by 2%, primarily in support of our clients with this loan growth continuing to be led by our securities-based loans and, to a lesser extent, residential mortgage loans. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment decreased to 1.14% at quarter end and nonperforming assets remain low at 34 basis points of bank segment assets. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans for investment ended the quarter at 93 basis points down 2 basis points from the prior quarter. The allowance percentage has trended lower, largely due to the loan mix shift towards more securities-based loans and residential mortgages, which carry lower allowance levels. These 2 loan categories represent well over half of our total loan book, reflecting 36% and 20%, respectively.\nWith regard to the relatively smaller corporate loan book, the bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was 1.94%. We believe the total allowance represents an appropriate reserve, but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our loan portfolios including any potential impact of tariff negotiations on certain corporate borrowers and the effect of which will affect our third quarter provision.\nSlide 13 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters, demonstrating the resilience of our diverse business mix to consistently deliver strong margins. On Slide 14. At quarter end, total assets were $83.1 billion, a 1% sequential increase, resulting primarily from loan growth. Liquidity and capital each remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at approximately $2.5 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. With a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 13.3% and total capital ratio of 24.8%, we remain well above regulatory requirements. As Paul mentioned, our capital levels provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.2% and an increase over the preceding quarter has the benefit from the excess share-based compensation that vested in the preceding quarter did not recur this quarter.\nFor the fiscal year 2025 we estimate our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 25%. Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. As Paul mentioned, we've been actively repurchasing shares. Over the past 5 quarters, we have returned to shareholders over $1.5 billion through common dividends and share reuses and we have been actively repurchasing shares in April. We remain committed over the long term to operate our businesses at capital levels in line with our stated targets. With our strong capital levels, we are well positioned to continue investing in organic growth prudently pursue acquisitions that meet our criteria of being a good cultural and strategic and we are well positioned to meet the needs of our clients and advisers and uncertain and challenging market conditions. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. I'm Kristie Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us.\nWith me on the call today are Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Reilly; President, Paul Shoukry; and Chief Financial Officer, Butch Oorlog.\nThe presentation being reviewed today is available on Raymond James' Investor Relations website. Following the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions.\nCalling your attention to Slide 2. Please note that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, industry or market conditions, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions and our level of success in integrating acquired businesses; anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments and general economic conditions. In addition, words such as believes, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, projects, forecasts and the future or conditional verbs such as may, will, could, should and would as well as any other statements that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in these statements. We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 8-K, which are available on our website.\nNow I'm happy to turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristie. Good evening. Thank you for joining us today. As we begin my 61st and final earnings call as CEO, I want to take a moment to thank you all. These quarterly conversations have always been constructive, and the dialogue has helped inform our investors and shareholders, and I'm sure they have appreciated over the years. I'm excited for the future.\nI believe Paul Shoukry and his leadership team will deliver leading results when he takes over next month following our annual meeting. He, along with the leadership team, bring both deep experience and a commitment to our culture and how it translates to our performance. The board and I have great confidence in their collective abilities and believe the future is very bright.\nI'm not writing off to the sunset though. As Executive Chairman, I will be supporting Paul when he needs it just as Tom James supported me when he handed neither reigns 15 years ago. The continuity of experience and counsel are important components of any transition.\nWith that, let's get into the fiscal first quarter. We achieved strong results in the quarter. We generated record net revenues and the second highest net income showcasing the strength of our diverse and complementary businesses. We ended the period with quarter-end record levels of PCG assets and fee-based accounts and a very healthy pipeline. With ample capital and funding, we remain well positioned to continue to invest in our business, our people and technology to help drive growth across all our businesses.\nBeginning on Slide 4. The firm reported record net revenues of $3.54 billion for the first fiscal quarter with net income available to common shareholders amounting to $599 million slightly below the previous quarter's record, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $2.86. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders equaled $614 million or $2.93 per diluted share.\nWe generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of 20.4% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 24.6%. The a great result, particularly given our strong capital base.\nMoving to Slide 5. Total client assets under administration increased 14% year-over-year to $1.56 trillion. Sequentially, client assets were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates and by 1 large departure we previously discussed. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up to a quarter-end record of $877 billion and financial assets under management were nearly unchanged at $244 billion.\nOver time, net new assets is primarily driven by our ongoing efforts in retaining and recruiting high-quality financial advisers. Domestic net new assets during the quarter equaled $14 billion representing a 4% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.\nAs we described on our last earnings call, impacting this quarter's performance was the departure of primarily 1 large branch in our independent contractor division. The impact was approximately $5 billion of AUA. Adjusting for those assets, domestic net new asset growth in the quarter would have been approximately 5.4%, a strong result.\nOver the prior 12 months, we recruited financial advisers with approximately $318 million of trailing 12-month production and $51 billion of client assets at their previous firms to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels. Including assets recruited into our RIA and Custody Services division, which we refer to as RCS, we recruited total client assets over the past 12 months of nearly $61 billion across all of our platforms. RCS finished the quarter with $188 billion of client assets under administration, up 28% year-over-year.\nFollowing the strong recruitment results we achieved in fiscal 2024 and in particular, the fiscal fourth quarter, our recruiting momentum continues to be strong under Jodi Perry's leadership. Jodi previously ran our ICD division and took the role to lead our firm-wide PCG recruiting. We remain optimistic about both the near-term and long-term growth given the pipeline of high-quality advisers and large teams.\nOverall, we remain focused on serving advisers across our multiple affiliation options. Despite our record high adviser satisfaction score, I have watched Paul Shoukry continue to double down on our service capabilities during the transition period, believing we can continue to do more. Our robust technology capabilities and client first values continue to enable us to retain and attract high-quality advisers, making Raymond James a destination of choice for advisers.\nTotal Clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances at the end of the quarter were $59.7 billion reflecting a 3% increase over September 2024. Of note, sweep balances grew 5% in the quarter. Bank loans grew 3% over the preceding quarter to a record $47.2 billion, primarily due to higher securities-based loans, which grew 4% in the quarter, as well as continued residential mortgage growth.\nMoving to Slide 6. Private Client Group generated pretax income of $462 million on record quarterly net revenue of $2.55 billion. Results were bolstered by higher PCG assets under administration compared to the previous year due to a strong equity market and the addition of net new assets to the firm.\nOur Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $480 million and a pretax income of $74 million. Net revenues grew 42% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher M&A revenues. Results this quarter marked the second best for M&A revenues and the third best quarter for investment banking revenues.\nThe Asset Management segment generated record pretax income of $125 million on record net revenues of $294 million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation and net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts.\nThe Bank segment generated net revenues of $425 million and pretax income of $118 million. On a sequential basis, bank segment net interest income increased 1% and while net interest margin of 2.6% declined 2 basis points compared to the preceding quarter.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Butch Oorlog, to review the financial results in detail. Butch?\n\nJonathan W. Oorlog\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Controller\n\nThank you, Paul. Turning to Slide 8. Consolidated net revenues reached a record $3.54 billion in the first quarter, representing a 17% increase over the prior year and a 2% rise sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees grew to $1.74 billion, representing 24% growth over the prior year and 5% over the preceding quarter. PCG domestic fee-based assets grew to $877 billion, up 17% over the prior year and slightly above the preceding quarter. As we look ahead, given 2 fewer billing days, asset management and related administrative fees are expected to decrease by approximately 2% in our fiscal second quarter.\nBrokerage revenues of $559 million grew 7% year-over-year primarily due to higher brokerage revenues in PCG. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment Banking revenues of $325 million increased 80% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Following a strong result in the preceding quarter, First quarter results continued to benefit from very strong M&A revenues, which grew 92% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.\nOther revenues declined $21 million sequentially, primarily due to lower affordable housing investments business revenues, where we typically see a slowdown in the fiscal first quarter following its seasonal high in the preceding quarter.\nMoving to Slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at $59.7 billion, up 3% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 4.3% of domestic PCG client assets. So far in the fiscal second quarter, domestic cash sweep balances have decreased by approximately $1.8 billion primarily due to quarterly fee billings of nearly $1.6 billion.\nTurning to Slide 10. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $673 million, down 1% compared to the preceding quarter. The bank segment net interest margin was down 2 basis points to 2.6% for the quarter while the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks decreased 22 basis points to 3.12%, and primarily due to the 225 basis point Fed rate cuts that occurred during the quarter as well as the 50 basis point rate cut that occurred late in the preceding quarter.\nBased on current rates and quarter end balances net of second quarter fee billings, we would expect the aggregate of NII and RJBDP third-party fees to be down 2% to 3% in the fiscal second quarter, in large part driven by 2 fewer billing days. Keep in mind, there are many variables that will impact actual results including any rate actions during the upcoming quarter and factors impacting our balance sheet, including loan and deposit balances.\nTurning to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. Compensation expense was $2.27 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 64.2%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the adjusted compensation ratio was 64%. As a reminder, the impact of salary increases arising from our annual cycle and effective on January 1, along with the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year, will each be reflected in our fiscal second quarter compensation expense.\nNon-compensation expenses of $516 million decreased 5% sequentially, largely due to a lower bank loan provision for credit losses and a decrease in professional fees. For the fiscal year, we expect non-compensation expenses excluding the bank loan loss provision for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items and non-GAAP adjustments presented in our non-GAAP financial measures to be approximately $2.1 billion, representing about 10% growth over the same adjusted non-compensation figure for the prior year.\nImportantly, we will continue to invest to support growth across the business while maintaining discipline over controllable expenses. As such, the majority of this projected increase reflects our continued investment in leading technology supporting our financial advisers as well as our expectations for overall growth in the business which drives, for example, higher sub-advisory fees, FDIC insurance premiums and recruiting costs.\nSlide 12 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. This quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 21.2% and adjusted pretax margin of 21.7%, achieving our target of 20% plus margin.\nOn Slide 13, at quarter end, our total assets were $82.3 billion, a 1% sequential decline. Liquidity and capital each remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.3 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. With a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 13% and total capital ratio of 25%, we remain well capitalized. Our capital levels provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.9%, reflecting a tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation that vested during the period. For fiscal 2025, we still estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25%.\nSlide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In December, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common shares 11% to $0.50 per share and authorized common stock repurchases of up to $1.5 billion, replacing the previous authorization.\nDuring the quarter, the firm repurchased 310,000 shares of common stock for $50 million at an average price of $161 per share. As of January 24, a approximately $1.45 billion remained under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization.\nGoing forward, we expect to continue to offset share-based compensation dilution and we'll be opportunistic with incremental share repurchases. Given our present capital and liquidity levels, we remain committed to maintain capital levels in line with our stated targets.\nLastly, on Slide 15, we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains solid. Nonperforming assets remained low at 26 basis points of bank segment assets and criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.26%.\nThe bank allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 95 basis points, down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The allowance percentage has trended lower, largely due to a loan mix shift toward more securities-based loans and residential mortgages, which carry lower allowance levels. and now account for 36% and 20%, respectively, of the total bank loan portfolio balances.\nThe bank loan balance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 1.93%, down 6 basis points from the preceding quarter. We believe our allowance represents an appropriate reserve, but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our loan portfolios.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Marone Shoukry\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nThank you, Butch. We are pleased with our strong results this quarter. And while the first calendar quarter, always has some seasonal headwinds with the reset of payroll taxes and fewer billable days, I am optimistic about fiscal 2025 and beyond.\nIn the Private Client Group, next quarter's results will be negatively impacted by 2 fewer billable days, which we expect to result in an approximate 2% decline in asset management and related fees. But adviser recruiting activity remains solid, and we're encouraged by the number of large team joining us and it's still in the pipeline.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, we are pleased to see a continuation of improved results this quarter as the market environment became more constructive for investment banking results and particularly for M&A, which had its second best quarter in our history. Our results in capital markets over the past 2 quarters reinforce our patient long-term approach and strategic investments we have made over the past several years, even during a challenging market backdrop.\nThe near record levels in M&A and investment banking this quarter were outstanding, and we remain optimistic for the rest of the fiscal year, given our healthy pipeline, along with a more conducive market environment and our well-positioned platform and capabilities.\nIn the fixed income business, the market is still challenging, but we've begun to see some improvement in the depository sector of our business. With the outlook for short-term rates moderating and the yield curve steepening, depository clients are starting to be more engaged in managing their securities portfolio.\nIn the Asset Management segment, we are confident that strong growth of assets and fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management to help drive further growth over time.\nIn the Bank segment, we have seen securities-based loan demand continue to increase as clients get more comfortable with the current level of rates, further supported by the Fed's recent rate cuts. With ample client cash balances and capital, we are well positioned to lend across the Loan segment as activity increases within our disciplined risk guidelines.\nAnd speaking of our strong capital position, we are well positioned to continue investing in organic growth and will be front footed in pursuing acquisitions that meet our criteria of being a good cultural fit and strategic fit. And while we decelerated the pace of share buybacks this particular quarter, our commitment to repurchase shares remains unchanged if we cannot deploy capital in those aforementioned growth initiatives.\nMeanwhile, the Board did increase our dividend by 11% to $0.50 per share per quarter and authorized common stock repurchases of up to $1.5 billion.\nOver the past 9 months, I have been spending much of my time traveling across the country meeting with our financial advisers, investment bankers, associates and clients. I could not be more energized and excited about our future. We have really great people who focus every day on helping their clients achieve their financial objectives.\nIn our best of both world's value proposition continues to be more and more differentiated across all of our businesses. We are unique in having the scope and breadth of products and capabilities to serve complex needs of clients, combined with our strong culture that is anchored on putting people first. This makes us a preferred destination for both current and prospective advisers, bankers and associates, which we believe will drive industry-leading growth over the long term.\nThe most powerful thing I hear consistently from financial advisers and associates is the best decision they ever made in their career was affiliating with Raymond James. And the biggest regret they have is they did not do it a few years earlier. That is really a testament to our unique values and all the great work our associates do each and every day to help financial professionals serve their clients. For that, on behalf of our entire leadership team, I want to thank our advisers and associates for making Raymond James such a special place.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions?"

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. I'm Kristie Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThe presentation being reviewed today is available on Raymond James' Investor Relations website. Following the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions.\nCalling your attention to Slide 2. Please note that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives; business prospects; financial results; industry or market conditions; anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions and our level of success in integrating acquired businesses; anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments; and general economic conditions.\nIn addition, words such as believes, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, projects, forecasts and future or conditional verbs such as may, will, could, should and would as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Please note that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in these statements.\nWe urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our website. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristie, and good evening. Thank you for joining us today. Last week, Paul and I attended our Summer Development Conference for our employee advisers. It's exciting to spend time with so many advisers who embody our client-first culture. We hear firsthand what makes Raymond James a great place for advisers who value the breadth of our technology and product platform so they can effectively serve their clients and importantly, a firm that provides advisers the tools they need to grow their businesses. Paul and I appreciate the passion and dedication of the thousands of advisers who continue to serve their clients day in and day out.\nTurning to our quarterly results. We once again delivered strong results in the quarter. Our diverse and complementary business combined to generate record results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. We continue to invest in our businesses, our people and our technology to help drive growth across all of our businesses.\nBeginning on Slide 4, the firm reported record fiscal third quarter net revenues of $3.23 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher asset management and related administrative fees. Quarterly net income available to common shareholders was $491 million or $2.31 per diluted share. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $508 million or $2.39 per diluted share.\nWe generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of 17.8% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 21.9%. A great result, particularly given our strong capital base. During the quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $243 million, bringing our fiscal year-to-date total to 5.1 million shares for $600 million.\nMoving to Slide 5. Client assets grew to record levels during this quarter, driven by rising equity markets and solid adviser retention and recruiting and PCG. Total client assets under administration increased 2% sequentially to $1.48 trillion. Private client assets and fee-based accounts grew to $821 billion and financial assets under management to $229 billion. Domestic net new assets during the quarter were $16.5 billion, representing a 5.2% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.\nOur robust technology capabilities, client-first values and long-established multiaffiliation options continue to retain and attract high-quality advisers to the platform. This quarter, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $92 million of trailing month production and $13.4 billion of client assets at their previous firms. Including RCS, we recruited client assets of $14.9 billion, making this our best quarter since 2021 in terms of recruited assets.\nFiscal year-to-date, trailing 12-month production of recruited advisers is up 33% and related client assets are up 52% over the prior 9-month period. These results do not include our RIA & Custody Services business, RCS, which also continues to have recruiting success and finished the quarter with $167 billion of client assets under administration.\nWe continue to experience growth in RCS from external joins as well as from internal transfers. This quarter, we reported record financial advisers of 8,782 and that does not include internal transfers to RCS of nearly 50 advisers, primarily all from one firm. While transfers to RCS lower the firm's adviser count, the client assets typically remain with the firm.\nLooking at fiscal year-to-date results, domestic net new assets were $47.7 billion, representing a 5.8% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic Private Client Group assets. a strong result compared to peer group. Total clients' domestic suite and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $56.4 billion, down 3% from March of 2024. We are pleased to see cash balances remain relatively flat in the quarter following fee billings paid in April.\nBank loans grew 2% over the preceding quarter to a record $45.1 billion, primarily due to higher securities based loans as demand for C&I loans remains muted. Moving on to Slide 6. Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $2.42 billion and pretax income of $441 million. Year-over-year results were bolstered by higher PCG assets under administration due to strong equity markets and net new assets brought into the firm.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $330 million and a pretax loss of $14 million. Net revenues grew 20% compared to a year ago quarter, primarily due to higher debt and equity underwriting revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 3%, primarily driven by the higher affordable housing investment revenues. Pretax loss in Capital Markets segment of $14 million reflects weak M&A results and the impact of amortization of deferred compensation granted in preceding quarters, which totaled approximately $20 million this quarter.\nWhile the timing of closings remain difficult to predict, we are still optimistic about our healthy pipeline and new business activity and M&A. We continue to expect investment banking revenues to improve along with industry-wide gradual recovery. The Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $112 million on record net revenues of $265 million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation and net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts.\nThe Bank segment generated net revenues of $418 million and pretax income of $115 million. The Bank segment net interest margin of 2.64%, declined just 2 basis points compared to the preceding quarter. Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7. We generated record net revenues of $9.36 billion and record net income available to common shareholders of $1.46 billion, up 9% and 12%, respectively, over the previous record set in the prior year.\nAdditionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 18.2% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.5% for the 9-month period. On Slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Asset Management segment for the first 9 months of the year primarily reflects the strong organic growth in PCG along with robust equity markets. And now I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry for his remarks. Paul?\n\nPaul Marone Shoukry\n\nPresident & CFO\n\nThank you, Paul. First, I just want to echo Paul's comments earlier on how great it was to attend our Summer Development Conference last week as well as our Elevate Conference earlier in the quarter and visiting several branches over the past few months. We truly have a fantastic group of financial advisers and associates who put their clients first each and every day.\nNow turning on to Slide 10. Consolidated net revenues were a record $3.23 billion in the third quarter, up 11% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees grew to $1.61 billion, representing 17% growth over the prior year and 6% over the preceding quarter. This quarter, PCG domestic fee-based assets increased 3%, which will be a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nBrokerage revenues of $532 million, grew 15% year-over-year, mostly due to higher brokerage revenues in PCG. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment Banking revenues of $183 million, increased 21% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Compared to the prior year quarter, third quarter results benefited primarily from stronger debt and equity underwriting revenues. However, M&A and advisory revenues remain subdued.\nMoving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $56.4 billion, down 3% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 4.3% of domestic PCG client assets. So far in the fiscal fourth quarter, domestic cash sweep balances have declined about $1.25 billion as cash inflows have partially offset quarterly fee billings of approximately $1.5 billion.\nTurning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $672 million, down 2% from the preceding quarter. The Bank segment net interest margin was relatively flat at 2.64% for the quarter, while the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks decreased 18 basis points to 3.41%. The decline in third-party yield was primarily due to a mix shift towards higher-yielding sweep offerings.\nBased on spot rates at the end of the third quarter and current balances, we would expect NII and RJBDP third-party fees to be flat or perhaps down nominally in the fiscal fourth quarter. But of course, we are always monitoring the competitive environment, which has been notably dynamic in the space over the past few weeks. This guidance does not factor any incremental changes we may make to sweep rates based on these competitive dynamics or other factors.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Compensation expense was $2.09 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 64.7%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the adjusted compensation ratio was 64.4%. Noncompensation expenses of $494 million, increased 6% sequentially, largely due to a favorable legal and regulatory net reserve release of $32 million in the preceding quarter that did not recur in the current quarter.\nGenerally, noncompensation expenses grew this quarter as expected to support growth across the businesses. For the fiscal year, we still expect noncompensation expenses, excluding provisions for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items or non-GAAP adjustments to be around $1.9 billion, consistent with our previous guidance.\nSlide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. This quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 20% and adjusted pretax margin of 20.7%, a strong result, especially given the challenging market conditions impacting capital markets. These results are in line with the targets provided at our recent Analyst and Investor Day meeting in May.\nOn Slide 15, at quarter end, our total assets were $80.6 billion, a 1% sequential decrease as loan growth was offset by declines in cash balances and the continued runoff of the securities portfolio in the Bank segment. Liquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. With Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.7% and total capital ratio of 23.6%, we remain well capitalized. Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the quarter, the firm repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $243 million at an average price of $122 per share. As of July 19, 2024, approximately $945 million remained under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization. Going forward, we expect to continue to offset share-based compensation dilution and to be opportunistic with incremental repurchases. Given our present capital and liquidity levels, we currently expect to increase the pace of buyback activity as we are committed to maintaining capital levels in line with our stated targets.\nLastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.15%, down from 1.21% in the preceding quarter. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1%. The allowance percentage has trended lower, largely due to a loan mix shift towards more securities-based loans and residential mortgages, which account for 34% and 20% of the total loan portfolio, respectively.\nThe bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 2% at the quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our loan portfolios. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. I am pleased with our strong results this quarter. And looking forward, we are well positioned with record levels of assets in bank loan starting off the fiscal fourth quarter. And while there is still economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses. In the Private Client Group, next quarter's results will be positively impacted by the 3% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts.\nOur adviser recruiting activity remains robust, and I am encouraged by a record number of large teams in the pipeline. We are focused on being a destination of choice for current and prospective advisers, which we believe over the long term should continue to drive industry-leading growth. In the Capital Markets segment, we continue to have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels, but our expectations are for a gradual recovery and are heavily influenced by market conditions, and we expect activity to pick up over the next few quarters.\nAnd in the fixed income business, although we've seen some improvement in depository, results are still lagging historical levels. Depository clients continue to experience flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on the brokerage activity. We hope once rate and cash balances begin to stabilize and grow, we will start to see an improvement.\nOverall, despite some near-term headwinds, we believe the investments we've made in the capital markets business have us well positioned for growth once the market and the rate environment become conducive. In Asset Management segment, we remain confident that strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.\nIn addition, we expect Raymond James investment management to help drive further growth over time. In the Bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diverse funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities-based loan payoffs decelerate and demand for these loans increase as clients get more comfortable at the current level of rates. Corporate growth has been muted as market activity remains low. However, with ample client cash balances and capital, we are well positioned to lend once activity increases within our conservative risk parameters.\nIn addition to driving organic growth across our businesses, we also remain focused on corporate development efforts. While we prefer to deploy capital through M&A, we plan to increase the pace of buybacks as we continue to look for opportunities that may meet our disciplined M&A parameters. I expect to have several questions related to the industry news regarding cash sweep changes that occurred over the past few weeks. We have been monitoring these emerging developments closely like you have and frankly, probably have some of the same questions. We are prepared to attempt to answer any questions you may have.\nIn closing, we are well positioned entering the fourth quarter with strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses and solid capital and liquidity base to invest in future growth. I want to thank our advisers and all of our associates for their continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients. Thanks for all you do. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions?"

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. I'm Kristie Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us.\nWith me on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, President and Chief Financial Officer. The presentation being reviewed today is available on Raymond James' Investor Relations website. Following the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions.\nCalling your attention to Slide 2. Please note, certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements include but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, industry or market conditions, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions and our level of success integrating acquired businesses, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments, and general economic conditions.\nIn addition, words such as believes, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, projects, forecasts and future or conditional verbs such as may, will, could, should and would as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in these statements.

Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristie. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Once again, we delivered strong results in the quarter. Highlighting our diversified platform, we generated record results for the fiscal second quarter and the first 6 months of the fiscal year. We continue to invest in our business, our people and technology to help drive growth across all our businesses.\nBefore discussing quarterly results, I want to highlight an important announcement made last month. Following a multiyear succession planning process, the Board of Directors appointed Paul Shoukry, our CFO, as President of Raymond James. And following a transition period, Paul is expected to become the firm's CEO sometime during the fiscal year 2025, becoming only the fourth Chief Executive in the company's 60-plus-year history.\nPaul has been an exceptional leader and a major contributor to Raymond James' steady growth and financial stability. I am confident he will continue to guide the firm with the same conservative long-term approach and laser focus on our advisers and client-first culture that has helped shape our success over the many years.\nIn addition, we're proud to announce that other key leadership appointments to take effect October 1, 2024. Private Client Group President, Scott Curtis, will become COO of Raymond James Financial, moving into the role following the retirement of Jeff Dowdle at the end of the fiscal year; Tash Elwyn, current Raymond James & Associates CEO will become President of PCG; and Global Equities and Investment Banking President, Jim Bunn, will become President of the Capital Markets segment.\nThese expanded roles are a direct reflection of the significant leadership and contributions that Scott, Tash and Jim have made over the years. I am confident, along with Paul, they will continue delivering on our mission to help clients achieve their financial objectives.\nNow to review the second quarter results, starting on Slide 5. The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $3.12 billion, an increase of 9% over the preceding year quarter, primarily due to higher asset-based revenues. Quarterly net income available to common shareholders was $474 million or $2.22 per diluted share. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $494 million or $2.31 per diluted share.\nThe quarter included the favorable impact of a legal and regulatory net reserve release of $32 million, predominantly driven by a reduction in the reserve related to the FCC off-platform communications matter.\nWe generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of 17.5% and annualized adjusted returns on tangible common equity of 21.8%, a great result, particularly given our strong capital base.\nMoving on to Slide 5. Client assets grew to record levels during the quarter, driven by rising equity markets and solid adviser retention and recruiting in the Private Client Group. Total client assets under administration increased 6% sequentially to $1.45 trillion. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts grew to $799 billion and financial assets under management reached $227 billion. Domestic net new assets were $9.6 billion, representing a 3.2% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic Private Client Group assets.\nThis quarter does reflect some seasonality typical in the first calendar quarter. And as we've seen before, net new assets can be volatile quarter-to-quarter as we onboard newly-recruited advisers and have advisers retire or leave the platform from time to time.\nWith our robust technology capabilities, client-first values and long-time multiple affiliated options, PCG continues to attract high-quality advisers to the platform.\nFor example, during the quarter, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $80 million of trailing 12-month production and $12.8 billion of client assets at their previous firm. Fiscal year-to-date, trailing 12-month production of recruited advisers is up 45% and related assets up 77% over the prior 6-month period.\nThere is a lag between recruiting results and net new assets as it takes some time for clients to transition to the Raymond James platform, but we are encouraged by the recruiting success so far this fiscal year. And these results do not include our RIA and custody services business which also continues to have recruiting success and finished the quarter with $161 billion of client assets under administration.\nLooking to our fiscal year-to-date results, domestic net new assets were $31.2 billion, representing a 5.7% annualized growth rate on the beginning of period domestic PCG assets, a strong result compared to our peers.\nTotal clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $58.2 billion, up slightly over December 2023.\nBank loans were essentially flat from the preceding quarter at $44.1 billion as loan demand remains relatively muted given higher rates.\nMoving on to Slide 6. Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $2.34 billion and pretax income of $444 million. Year-over-year results were driven by higher asset management fees, reflecting the nearly 20% growth of assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the current quarter, compared with the same prior year period.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $321 million and a pretax loss of $17 million. Net revenues grew 6% compared to a year ago quarter primarily due to higher M&A and debt underwriting revenues. Sequentially, revenues [indiscernible] due to lower fixed income brokerage revenues and M&A and advisory revenues, partially offset by higher debt underwriting revenues.\nThe pretax loss in Capital Markets of $17 million reflects the impact of amortization of deferred compensation granted in proceeding periods which totaled $20 million this quarter.\nWhile the timing of closings remains difficult to predict, we are encouraged by the healthy pipelines and new business activity and M&A. We continue to expect investment banking revenues to improve along with the industry-wide gradual recovery.\nThe Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $100 million on record net revenues of $252 million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter due to market appreciation and net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts.\nThe Bank segment generated net revenues of $424 million and pretax income of $75 million. Bank segment net interest margin of 2.66% declined 8 basis points compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to the higher cost mix of deposits as the Enhanced Savings Program balances replaced a portion of the lower-cost RJBDP cash suite balances.\nLooking to the fiscal year-end date results on Slide 7. We generated record net revenues of $6.13 billion, and record net income available to common shareholders of $971 million, up 8% and 4%, respectively, over the prior year's record. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 18.3% and an annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.8% for the 6-month period.\nOn Slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Asset Management segment for the first half of the year primarily reflects the strong organic growth in PCG with robust equity markets.\nAnd now I'll turn over to Paul Shoukry, our CFO; and soon to be CEO for the second quarter results. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Starting on Slide 10. Consolidated net revenues were $3.12 billion in the second quarter, up 9% over the prior year and up 3% sequentially.\nAsset management and related administrative fees grew to $1.52 billion, representing 16% growth over the prior year and 8% over the preceding quarter.\nThis quarter, PCG fee-based assets increased 7%, which will be a strong tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal third quarter.\nBrokerage revenues of $528 million grew 6% year-over-year, mostly due to higher brokerage revenues in PCG which were partially offset by lower fixed income brokerage revenues as depository clients continue to experience flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities.\nRemember, in our Fixed Income business, we do not have the same exposure to the higher volatility, currency and credit products that have benefited many of the larger players in our industry during the quarter. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly.\nInvestment Banking revenues of $179 million increased 16% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Compared to the prior year quarter, second quarter results benefited from stronger debt underwriting revenues in both fixed income and public finance as well as improvement in M&A and advisory revenues which continued to be subdued.\nMoving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $58.2 billion, up slightly over the preceding quarter and representing 4.6% of domestic PCG client assets. Sweep balances were essentially flat and ESP balances increased 3% sequentially, both outperforming our expectations on the last call.\nSince the beginning of this quarter, domestic cash sweep balances have declined about $1.7 billion mostly due to quarterly fee billings, along with income tax payments.\nTurning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $689 million, down 1% from the preceding quarter, largely reflecting one fewer billable day. Again, this result outperformed our guidance on last quarter's call, given the more stable client cash balances.\nGoing forward, net interest income and RJBDP third-party fees will largely be dependent on the level of short-term interest rates, the stability of client cash balances and the trajectory of loan growth which has been subdued in this rate environment. Fortunately, we are well positioned for the eventual recovery in loan growth with ample capital and funding flexibility.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Compensation expense was $2.04 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 65.5%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the adjusted compensation ratio was 65.2%.\nAs is typical in the first calendar quarter, compensation expenses were impacted by annual salary increases and the reset of payroll taxes. All in, an adjusted compensation ratio close to 65% is in line with our current target and is a satisfactory result given the challenging environment for the Capital Markets segment.\nNon-compensation expenses of $466 million increased 1% sequentially, largely due to higher communications and information processing expenses and a higher bank loan loss provision, which were partially offset by a favorable legal and regulatory net reserve release of $32 million in the quarter, which Paul mentioned earlier.\nFor the fiscal year, we still expect non-compensation expenses, excluding provision for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items or non-GAAP adjustments to be around $1.9 billion. This implies incremental non-compensation growth throughout the year as we continue to invest in growth and ensure high service levels for advisers and their clients throughout our businesses.\nKeep in mind, many of our non-compensation expenses, such as investment sub-advisory fees, represent healthy growth that follows the corresponding revenue growth.\nSlide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. This quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 19.5% and adjusted pretax margin of 20.4%, a strong result, especially given the challenging market conditions impacting capital markets.\nAs a reminder, our current targets provided at our Analyst and Investor Day last May, are for pretax margin of 20% plus and a compensation ratio of less than 65%. We still think these targets are appropriate, and we will provide an update as needed at our upcoming Analyst Investor Day scheduled for May 23.\nOn Slide 15, at quarter end, total balance sheet assets were $81.2 billion, a 1% sequential increase.\nLiquidity and capital remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. And we remain well capitalized with Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.3% and a total capital ratio of 23.3%.\nOur capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%, reflecting the favorable impact of nontaxable corporate-owned life insurance gains in the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe 24% is an appropriate estimate for the effective tax rate.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the quarter, the firm repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $207 million at an average price of $122 per share. Including $43 million of shares repurchased in April, we completed the expected $250 million of these share repurchases since January 1 and fulfilled the repurchase commitment associated with the dilution from the TriState Capital acquisition.\nAs of April 19, 2024, approximately $1.14 billion remained under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization. Going forward, we expect to continue to offset share-based compensation dilution and to be opportunistic with incremental repurchases.\nWe are committed to maintaining capital levels in line with our stated targets, and we'll discuss more on our overall capital management strategy at our upcoming Analyst Investor Day.\nLastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.21%, up from 1.06% from the preceding quarter.\nThe bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.06%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of the corporate loans held for investment was 2.05% at quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our loan portfolios.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Paul I just want to say that I am absolutely honored to be named President [Audio Gap]\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\n[Audio Gap] pipeline and good engagement levels, but our expectations for a gradual recovery are heavily influenced by market conditions. And we could expect activity to pick up over the next 6 to 9 months.\nAnd in the Fixed Income business, the overall dynamic of the past year remain unchanged. Depository clients are experiencing flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. We hope that once rate and cash balances stabilize, we will start to see an improvement.\nOverall, despite some of the near-term challenges, we believe the investments we've made in the Capital Markets business have positioned us well for growth once the market rate environment becomes conducive.\nIn the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third quarter, up 5% over the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues. We remain confident that strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James investment management to help drive further growth over time.\nIn the Bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diverse funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities-based loan payoffs decelerate, and we expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates.\nWith little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been muted. However, with ample client cash balances and capital, we are well positioned to lend once activity increases [ and ] our conservative risk guidelines.\nIn addition to driving organic growth across our businesses, we also remain focused on the corporate development efforts for opportunities that may meet our disciplined M&A parameters.\nIn closing, we are well positioned entering the fiscal third quarter with a strong competitive positioning in all of our business and solid capital and liquidity base to invest in future growth.\nAs always, I want to thank our advisers who drive this business and associates for their continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients. Thank you for all you do.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. I'm Kristi Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us today. With me on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, Chief Financial Officer. The presentation being reviewed today is available on Raymond James' Investor Relations website. In the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions.

We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and the Form 8-K, which are available on our website. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristi. Good evening. Thank you for joining us today. Who would have thought, given all the uncertainty over the past year, we would have ended the last fiscal year with record results and generated record earnings per share and record client assets this quarter. This is a testament to our focus on executing on our strategic priorities, which are rooted in our adviser and [indiscernible] focused cultures. These priorities have remained consistent over many years. They are to drive organic growth throughout our businesses, invest in technology and service capabilities and to maintain focus on strategic M&A and effective integrations. Through our relentless focus on these priorities, we have maintained long-term success across changing market environments. Now to review the first quarter results, starting on Slide 4. The firm reported quarterly net revenues of $3.01 billion, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher asset-based revenues. Quarterly net income available to common shareholders was $497 million or a record $2.32 per diluted share. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $514 million or $2.40 per diluted share, both records.\nWe generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of 19.1% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 23.8%, a great result, particularly given our strong capital base. Moving to Slide 5. Client assets grew to record levels this quarter, driven by strong adviser retention and recruiting results, along with the strong market. Total client assets under administration increased 9% sequentially to $1.37 trillion Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts grew to $747 billion and financial assets under management reached $215 billion. PCG continues to generate strong organic growth evidenced this quarter with domestic net new assets of $21.6 billion, representing a 7.8% annualized growth rate on beginning-of-period domestic PCG assets. Advisers are attracted to our robust technology capabilities and client-first values, and through our long-established multiple affiliation options, they can find the right fit for their business.\nDuring the quarter, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels. financial advisers with approximately $60 million of trailing 12 production and $13 billion of client assets at their previous firms. These results do not include our RIA and custody services, businesses, which also continued to have recruiting success and finished the quarter with $147 billion of assets. Despite strong recruiting activity, the financial adviser count was sequentially flat, mostly due to an elevated number of retirements, which are seasonally higher in the first quarter but where the firm typically retains the vast majority of assets through previously established succession plans. In addition, advisers moving to our RIA channel are excluded from the adviser count since they no longer carry a FINRA license with us. We announced that the President of our PCG independent contractor division, Jodi Perry, transition to a newly created role of National Head of Advisor Recruiting. Jodi has generated outstanding results in every role she has held in her nearly 30-year career with Raymond James, and I am confident she will continue to strengthen this key growth engine for the firm. This key leadership appointment continues to highlight the importance and focus on adviser recruiting.\nWith this transition, we are excited about Shannon Reed becoming the PCG Independent Contractor division President and joining the firm's executive committee. Shannon's most recently served as Senior Vice President of our Northeast division. She has background and has been a stellar leader in an important market. Total clients' domestic suite and enhanced program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion, up 3% over September 2023. Balances were boosted by growth in both the enhanced savings program as well as the client sweep balances. Bank loans increased 1% from the preceding quarter to a record $44.2 billion although loan demand remains relatively muted given higher rates. Moving to Slide 6. Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $2.23 billion and pretax income of $439 million. Year-over-year, results were driven by higher asset management fees, reflecting 18% growth of assets in fee-based accounts. The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $338 million and a pretax income of $3 million. Investment Banking revenues grew 15% compared to a year ago quarter due to higher M&A and underwriting revenues. Sequentially, robust fixed income brokerage revenue growth largely offset weaker M&A and affordable housing investment results.\nWhile fixed income results were stronger during the quarter, investment banking activity industry-wide appear to be on a gradual recovery. The uncertain market environment, along with the impact of the amortization of share-based compensation granted in the preceding periods, has strained the near-term profitability of segment results. We remain focused on managing controllable expenses. The Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $93 million on net revenues of $235 million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter, due to market appreciation and added inflows into PCG fee-based accounts. The bank segment generated net revenues of $441 million and pretax income of $92 million. Bank segment net interest margin of 2.74% declined 13 basis points compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to a higher cost mix of deposits as enhanced savings program balances that replaced a portion of lower RJBDP cash suite balances. Now I'll turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of the first quarter results. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Starting on Slide 8. Consolidated net revenues were $3.01 billion in the first quarter, up 8% over the prior year and down 1% sequentially compared to the record set in the preceding quarter. Asset Management and related administrative fees grew 13% over the prior year and declined 3% compared to the preceding quarter. The sequential decline was largely the result of lower fee-based assets at the beginning of the quarter compared to the beginning of the preceding quarter. This quarter, fee-based assets increased 9%, which will be a strong tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal second quarter. Brokerage revenues of $522 million grew 8% year-over-year mostly due to higher transactional activity in PCG. Sequentially, brokerage revenues increased 9%, the result of higher institutional fixed income brokerage revenues as client activity increased and the trading environment was more favorable. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment Banking revenues of $181 million increased 28% year-over-year. Sequentially, the 10% decline was driven predominantly by lower M&A revenues.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that the environment for M&A is improving, and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new business activity. However, there remains a lot of uncertainty, and we are hopeful a gradual recovery will lead to better results over the next 6 to 9 months. Other revenues of $38 million were down 30% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to lower affordable housing investment revenues compared to the seasonally high fiscal fourth quarter. Moving to Slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced saving program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion, up 3% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 4.8% of domestic PCG client assets. Advisers continue to serve their clients effectively, leveraging our competitive cash offerings. Many clients have now taken advantage of the attractive enhanced saving program and other high-yielding products. Thus, the pace of flows into this program has decelerated as we expected, growing approximately $900 million or 7% this quarter. A large portion of the total cash coming into ESP has been new cash brought into the firm by advisers, highlighting the attractiveness of this product and Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability.\nWhile we are encouraged by the modest sequential growth of client cash balances during the quarter, which was helped by seasonal tailwinds in the fourth calendar quarter we continue to expect some further yield-seeking activity by clients. Through Monday of this week, sweep and ESP balances are down approximately $1.5 billion for the month of January, primarily due to quarterly fee billings of $1.35 billion. RJBDP sweep balances with third-party banks were $17.8 billion at quarter end up 12% from September 2023. The strong growth of enhanced savings program balances at Raymond James Bank has allowed for more balances to be deployed off balance sheet with third-party banks. While this dynamic has negatively impacted the bank segment's NIM because of the lower-cost sweep balances being swept off balance sheet, it ultimately provides clients when an attractive deposit solution while also optimizing the firm's funding flexibility by providing a large funding cushion for when attractive growth opportunities emerge. Looking forward, we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth.\nTurning to Slide 10. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $698 million, down 2% from the preceding quarter due to lower firm-wide net interest income resulting from NIM compression, but outperforming our expectations on the last earnings call as client cash balance were more stable than we expected at that time. The bank segment's net interest margin decreased 13 basis points sequentially to 2.74% for the quarter. and the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 6 basis points to 3.66%. While there are many variables that will impact actual results, absent any changes to short-term interest rates, we currently expect combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to be about 5% lower in the fiscal second quarter compared to the fiscal first quarter just based on spot balances after the fee billings this quarter and our expectation of some continued client cash sorting activity. Hopefully, we can outperform this expectation again this quarter, but we believe it's prudent to err on the side of conservatism, given the continued uncertainty around client cash balance trends. We remain focused on preserving flexibility in growing net interest income and RJBDP fees over the long term, which we believe we are well positioned to do.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. Compensation expense was $1.92 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 63.8%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the adjusted compensation ratio was 63.4%. Looking ahead, the impact of salary increases effective on January 1 and the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year will be reflected in the fiscal second quarter. Non-compensation expenses of $462 million decreased 20% sequentially, largely due to elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters in the preceding quarter. Whereas this quarter was a relatively quiet quarter for legal and regulatory reserves. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter declined to $12 million. I'll discuss more related to the credit quality in the bank segment shortly. We remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. For the fiscal year, we expect non-compensation expenses, excluding provision for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items or non-GAAP adjustments to be around $1.9 billion. This implies incremental non-compensation growth throughout the year as we continue to invest in growth and ensure high service levels for advisers and their clients throughout our businesses.\nAnd remember, many of the non-compensation expenses, such as investment sub-advisory fees, represent healthy growth that follows the corresponding revenue growth. Slide 12 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. This quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 20.9% and an adjusted pretax margin of 21.7%, a strong result given the industry-wide challenges impacting capital markets. As a reminder, our current targets provided at our Analyst and Investor Day last May, are for a pretax margin of 20-plus percent and a compensation ratio of less than 65%. We still think these targets are appropriate, and we will provide an update as needed at the next Analyst and Investor Day scheduled for May 22. On Slide 13, at quarter end, total balance sheet assets were $80.1 billion, a 2% sequential increase. Liquidity and capital remained very strong. RGF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. And we remain well capitalized with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.1% and a total capital ratio of 23%.\nOur capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%, reflecting a tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation that vested during the period. Going forward, we still believe that 24% to 25% is an appropriate estimate to use in your models. Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the quarter, the firm repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $150 million at an average price of $107 per share. As of January 24, 2024, a approximately $1.39 billion remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization. Our current plan, which is subject to change, is to repurchase at least $200 million of shares in the fiscal second quarter to complete the remaining repurchases associated with the dilution from the TriState Capital acquisition. Following the second quarter, we expect to continue to offset share-based compensation dilution and to be opportunistic with incremental repurchases.\nLastly, on Slide 15, we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.09%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.08%. The bank loan loss allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 2.06% at quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our corporate loan portfolio, including the commercial real estate portfolio. Within the CRE portfolio, we have prudently limited the exposure to office loans, which represent just 3% of the bank segment's total loans. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. As I said at the start of the call, I am pleased with our results for the first fiscal quarter, generating record earnings per share and ending the quarter with record client assets. And while there is still economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength and are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses. In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be positively impacted by the 9% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts. Near term, we expect some headwinds to the interest-sensitive earnings at both PCG and the bank segment, given ongoing cash sorting activity in uncertain rate environment. However, we are already seeing some of the higher-yield competitor rates coming in. Despite this, I believe our effort and focus on being a destination of choice for our current and prospective advisers will continue to drive industry-leading growth. Our adviser recruiting activity remains robust, including a record number of large teams in the pipeline.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, we continue to have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels. But our expectations for a gradual recovery are heavily influenced by market conditions, and we would expect activity to likely pick up over the next 6 to 9 months. And the fixed income business we saw improvements in this quarter with higher activity, but the dynamics of the past year persists. Depository clients are experiencing flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. We hope that once rates and cash balances stabilize, we will start to see an improvement. Despite some of the near-term challenges, we believe capital markets business is well positioned for growth once the market and rate environment become conducive. In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal second quarter, up 9% over the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues. We remain confident that strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.\nIn addition, we expect Raymond James investment management to help drive further growth over time. In the bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen security-based loans payoffs decelerate and are starting to experience growth. We expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates. With little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been muted. However, spreads have improved and with ample client cash balances and capital, we are well positioned to lend once activity increases in our conservative risk parameters. In addition to our focus on organic growth across our businesses, we have also ramped up corporate development efforts.\nIn closing, we are well positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses and solid capital and liquidity base to invest in future growth. As always, I would be remiss if I did not thank our advisers and associates for their continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients. Thank you for all you do. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions?"

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedules accompanying our presentation and press release. Now I'll turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood evening, and thank you for joining us today. I've spent a lot of time in these last few weeks in front of our advisers. First, traveling with our top-producing independent advisers on a great trip. Great to see the success in their business and the positive nature of how they feel about the firm.\nAnd then attending our RCS conference, our RIA division and clearing firm. Again, that division is over 10% of our Private Client Group assets now, and it's great to see the growth and the enthusiasm there also.\nNow turning to our results. Despite the challenging environment, which included a regional banking crisis, heightened volatility and rapidly rising interest rates, we generated record net revenues and earnings for the last fiscal year. That's our third consecutive year of record results in very different market environments was achieved by staying true to our core.\nWe put clients first, we act with integrity, we value independence and think long term. These core values are more than words on a page, they are lived day in and day out by our advisers and associates. This dedication and focus provides stability during tough economic times and what makes me confident about our continued success in the future.\nReviewing fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4. The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $3.05 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $432 million or $2.02 per diluted share.\nExcluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $457 million or $2.13 per diluted share. The increase in asset management revenues and interest-related revenues drove significant revenue growth over the prior year with net revenues increasing 8%.\nQuarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters, including an incremental $55 million provision related to the previously disclosed SEC industry sweep on off-platform communications. This provision resulted in an impact during the quarter of $0.26 per diluted share.\nWe generated strong returns for the fiscal fourth quarter with an annualized return on common equity of 17.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.2%. A great result, particularly given our strong capital base.\nMoving on to Slide 5, the year-over-year client asset growth was strong driven by organic growth in all of our affiliation options, along with market appreciation. We ended the quarter with a total client assets under administration of $1.26 trillion, PCG based assets and fee-based accounts of $683 billion and financial assets under management of $196 billion.\nWith our continuing focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisers, PCG consistently generates strong organic growth, which was evident again this year, with domestic net new assets of $14.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, representing a 5% annualized growth rate on beginning of the period, domestic PCG assets.\nFor the fiscal year, domestic net new assets of $73 billion reflected a 7.7% annual growth rate, which is a leading result in the industry. During the fiscal year, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $250 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $38 billion of client assets to their previous firms. These results do not include our RIA and custody services business, RCS, which had another strong year in recruited results.\nMore importantly, we continue to maintain a very low regrettable attrition levels of financial advisers at about 1%. These factors contribute to our annual NNA growth of 7.7%.\nTotal clients' domestic suite and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at $56 billion, down 3% compared to June of 2023. The enhanced savings program with its competitive rate and robust FDIC insurance coverage continued to attract significant cash this quarter, partially offsetting a decline in client suite balances largely due to quarterly fee billings and cash sorting activity. Total bank loans increased 1% from the preceding quarter to $44 billion reflecting muted loan demand to our target markets, giving rising rates and the macroeconomic uncertainty.\nMoving on to Slide 6, Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $2.27 billion and pretax income of $477 million. Year-over-year, results were lifted by strong asset-based revenues and the benefit of higher interest rates and interest-related revenues and fees.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $341 million and a pretax loss of $7 million. Revenue declined 15% compared to the prior year quarter mostly driven by lower fixed income brokerage and investment banking revenues. However, we were pleased to see a sequential improvement in M&A and advisory revenues this quarter.\nAdditionally, our public finance business had improved results with debt underwriting [ grow 32% ] sequentially. The extremely challenging market environment, particularly for investment banking, has strained the near-term profitability of segment results. And as we explained previously, the segment results are negatively impacted by amortization of share-based compensation from prior years as well as growth investments. We remain focused on managing controllable expenses as near-term revenues are depressed.\nThe Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $100 million on net revenues of $236 million. The increases in net revenues and pretax income over the preceding quarter were largely the result of higher assets in PCG fee-based accounts at the beginning of a quarterly billing period and strong net flows in Raymond James Investment Management which generated $920 million of net inflows during the fiscal fourth quarter and $2.2 billion of net inflows in the fiscal year. The bank segment generated net revenues of $451 million and pretax income of $78 million.\nFourth quarter NIM for the bank segment of 2.87% and declined 4 basis points compared to a year ago quarter and 39 basis points compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to a higher cost mix of deposits. We continue to add diverse higher-cost funding sources with our enhanced savings program and consequentially shifted more of a lower-cost suite funding to third-party banks. In a few minutes, Paul Shoukry will discuss this further.\nWhile this negatively impacted the bank segment NIM, there is an offset in higher RJBDP third-party bank fees, so still a net positive for the firm overall while also providing advisers an attractive depositive alternative to offer their clients.\nLooking at fiscal 2023 results on Slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $11.6 billion and record net income available to common shareholders of $1.7 billion, up 6% and 15%, respectively, over the prior year's records. Additionally, we generated strong returns on common equity of 17.7% and adjusted returns on tangible common equity of 22.5% for the fiscal year.\nOn Slide 8, the strength of the PCG and bank segments for the fiscal year primarily reflects the benefit of strong organic growth in the Private Client Group, the successful integration of TriState Capital and the benefit from higher short-term interest rates. When compared to the record activity levels in the year ago period, weaker capital markets results reflect the challenging environment for investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenues despite incremental revenues from the SumRidge acquisition, which we completed in June of of 2022.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Starting on Slide 10, consolidated net revenues were a record $3.05 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% over the prior year and 5% sequentially. The Asset management and related administrative fees grew 12% compared to the prior year quarter and 5% sequentially due to the higher assets and fee-based accounts at the end of the preceding quarter. This quarter, fee-based assets declined 2%, which will be a headwind for our asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal first quarter of 2024.\nBrokerage revenues of $480 million were flat year-over-year and increased 4% sequentially. Year-over-year, the lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment were offset by higher brokerage revenues in PCG. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly.\nInvestment Banking revenues of $202 million declined 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, the 34% increase was driven predominantly by higher M&A and advisory revenues as well as a solid quarter for public finance. We are cautiously optimistic that the environment for M&A is improving, and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new business activity.\nHowever, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timing of deals launching and closing given the heightened market volatility and geopolitical concerns. So while we may not see a significant improvement in the next fiscal quarter, we are hoping for better results over the next 6 to 12 months.\nOther revenues of $54 million were down 33% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower revenues from affordable housing investments. The pipeline for that business remains strong, but several closings slipped to fiscal 2024 due to higher interest rates.\nMoving to Slide 11, Clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced saving program balances ended the quarter at $56.4 billion, down 3% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 5.1% of domestic PCG client assets. Advisers continue to serve their clients effectively, leveraging our competitive cash offerings.\nThe enhanced savings program grew approximately $2.4 billion in deposits this quarter. A large portion of the total cash coming into ESP has been new cash brought to the firm by advisers, highlighting the attractiveness of this product and Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability.\nAs many eligible clients have now taken advantage of this product, the pace of flows into the enhanced savings program has understandably decelerated. Through Monday of this week, sweep and ESP balances are down approximately $620 million for the month of October, as growth in ESP balances was more than offset by the quarterly fee billings, as expected. We continue to believe we are closer to the end of the cash sorting dynamic than we are to the beginning. However, until rates stabilize, we would not be surprised to see further yield-seeking behavior by clients.\nSweep balances with third-party banks were $15.9 billion at the quarter end, giving us a large funding cushion when attractive growth opportunities surface. The strong growth of enhanced savings program balances at Raymond James Bank has allowed for more balances to be deployed off balance sheet.\nWhile this dynamic has negatively impacted the bank segment's NIM because of the geography of the lower-cost suite balances being swept off balance sheet, it ultimately provides clients with an attractive deposit solution while also optimizing the firm's funding flexibility. Looking forward, we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth.\nTurning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $711 million. Nearly flat from the immediately preceding quarter as a sequential decrease in firm-wide net interest income was offset by higher RJBDP fees from third-party banks.\nIf you recall, on our last earnings call, we anticipated a 5% sequential decline in these interest-related revenues. So we are pleased with the better-than-expected results which was partly a function of higher-than-anticipated yields on RJBDP third-party balances.\nThe bank segment's net interest margin decreased 39 basis points sequentially to 2.87% for the quarter. While the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 23 basis points to 3.6%.\nWhile there are many variables that will impact actual results, Absent any changes to short-term interest rates, we currently expect combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to be around 5% lower in the fiscal first quarter as compared to the fiscal fourth quarter and that's just based on spot balances after the fee billings this quarter.\nAs experienced over the past 2 quarters, this guidance may prove to once again be conservative if cash sweep balances stabilize around current levels and/or if the bank assets grow more than anticipated during the rest of the quarter. But as we have always said, instead of concentrating on maximizing NIM over the near term, we are more focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income and RJBDP fees over the long term, which we believe we are still well positioned to do.\nAs many of you may recall, our expectation has always been that the industry would overearn on interest income early on in a rising rate environment and then experienced some normalization of interest earnings as clients redeploy their cash to higher-yielding alternatives.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Compensation expense was $1.89 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 62%. The adjusted compensation ratio was 61.4% during the quarter, which we are very pleased with, especially given the challenging environment for capital markets.\nNon-compensation expenses of $576 million increased 1% sequentially. As Paul Reilly mentioned earlier, the fiscal fourth quarter included the incremental provision related to the previously disclosed SEC industry sweep on off-platform communications of $55 million, resulting in an impact during the quarter of $0.26 per diluted share. Combined with the provision in the fiscal third quarter, we are confident that we are now fully reserved for this matter.\nThe bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of $36 million increased $2 million over the prior year quarter and decreased $18 million compared to the preceding quarter. I'll discuss more related to the credit quality in the bank segment shortly.\nIn summary, while there has been some noise with elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters this year, adjusted non-compensation expenses, excluding loan loss provision and those legal and regulatory provisions came in very close to our annual expectation of $1.7 billion, reinforcing that we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth in ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.\nSlide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. In the current quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 19.2% and adjusted pretax margin of 20.3%, a strong result given the industry-wide challenges impacting capital markets in the aforementioned legal and regulatory provisions.\nOn Slide 15, at quarter end, total assets were $78.4 billion, a 1% sequential increase. Liquidity and capital remain very strong. RJF Corporate cash at the [ parent ] ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target.\nThe Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.9% and total capital ratio of 22.8% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized. The 11.9% Tier 1 leverage ratio reflects nearly $1.5 billion of excess capital above our conservative 10% target which would still be 2x more than the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized.\nOur capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth. We also have significant sources of contingent funding. We have a $750 million revolving credit facility and nearly $9.5 billion of FHLB capacity in the bank segment.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the fiscal year, the firm repurchased 8.35 million shares of common stock for $788 million, an average price of $94 per share. As of October 25, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization.\nWhile we didn't complete any repurchases in the fourth quarter due to self-imposed restrictions, just to be prudent, given our knowledge of the aforementioned SEC platform matter, we remain committed to our planned repurchases to offset dilution from the TriState Capital acquisition and the share-based compensation as we previously discussed.\nLastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.17%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.07%.\nThe bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of total corporate loans held for investment was 2.03% at quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints, higher interest rates and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio. Given industry-wide challenges, we continue to closely monitor the commercial real estate portfolio and more specifically, the office portfolio. We have prudently limited the exposure to office loans which represents just 3% of the bank's segment's total loans.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. As I said from the start of the call, I am pleased with our results for the fiscal 2023 and our ability to generate record earnings even in challenging market conditions. The record results this fiscal year once again highlight the strength of our diverse and complementary businesses. And while there is still near-term economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength and are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses.\nIn the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the 2% sequential decline in assets in fee-based accounts. Near term, we expect some headwinds to interest-sensitive earnings at both PCG and the bank segment given ongoing cash sorting activity.\nHowever, I am optimistic we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology and product solutions. Our adviser recruiting activity has picked up significantly over the last 2 months with record numbers of large teams in the pipeline.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, as we saw this quarter, there are some signs of improvement in investment banking, and we continue to have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels. But while there's still reason for optimism, we expect the pace and timing of transactions to be heavily influenced by market conditions and would expect activity to likely pick up over the next 6 to 12 months.\nAnd in the fixed income space, the dynamics of last year persist. Depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. We hope once rates and cash balances stabilize, we can start to see an improvement. So while there are some near-term challenges, we believe the capital markets business is well positioned for growth given the investments we've made over the past 5 years, which have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share.\nIn the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal quarter down 2% compared to the preceding quarter, which should create a headwind to revenue. We remain confident that strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James investment management to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution, operational and marketing synergies.\nIn the bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities-based loan payoffs decelerate and are starting to experience growth. We expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates.\nWith little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been tepid. However, spreads have improved and with ample cash sitting on third-party banks and lots of capital we are well positioned to lend once activity increases.\nIn closing, entering fiscal 2024, we believe our strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses, along with our ample capital and liquidity has us well positioned to drive future growth. I want to thank our advisers and associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day, especially in uncertain times when clients need trusted advice the most. Thank you for all you do.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you open the line for questions?"

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. Now I will turn it over to Kristie Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial.\n\nKristina Waugh\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. With us on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, Chief Financial Officer. The presentation being reviewed today is available on Raymond James' Investor Relations website. Following the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions.\nCalling your attention to Slide 2. Please note, certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedules accompanying our press release and presentation. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood evening. Thank you for joining us today. Since our last earnings call, we hosted our 2 major adviser conferences for both the independent and employee affiliation channels and also had our Chairman's Council Recognition Trip for our top employee advisers. I'm so proud of our advisers unwavering dedication to serving their clients and helping them to navigate these volatile and uncertain times.\nOur advisers have also expressed their appreciation of our commitment to managing the firm for the long term and always striving to be a source of strength and stability for them and their clients. It's these shared values that have resulted in our success through multiple cycles since our founding and what makes me confident about our continued success in the future.\nNow turning to our results. Despite the challenging environment and elevated market volatility since the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, we generated record net revenues and earnings for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Reviewing third quarter results, starting on Slide 4. The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.9 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $369 million or $1.71 per diluted share.\nExcluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $399 million or $1.85 per diluted share. The increase in interest-related revenues driven by higher short-term interest rates drove significant earnings growth over the prior year.\nNet revenues increased 7%, and net income available to common shareholders grew 23%. Quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million and bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million, which was predominantly driven by significantly weakened macroeconomic assumptions for the Moody's CRE price index utilized in our CECL models.\nNotwithstanding these items, we had a solid quarter in a tough market environment. We generated strong returns with annualized returns on common equity of 14.9% and annualized adjusted returns on tangible common equity of 19.7%. We believe this is a leading result, especially considering our strong capital base.\nMoving to Slide 5. The strength of our PCG business really shine driving record assets this quarter. We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.28 trillion, record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $697 billion and financial assets under management of $201 billion.\nWith our continued focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisers, PCG consistently generates strong organic growth, which was evident again this quarter, with domestic net new assets of $14.4 billion, representing a 5.4% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.\nHowever, I'll note net new assets in our adviser count were negatively impacted by an independent contractor relationship whose affiliation with the firm ended in the fiscal third quarter. This was a planned in mutual separation, and more than 60% of the assets and advisers stayed with Raymond James. The impact of the portion that moved off the platform this quarter was $4.6 billion in assets and 60 financial advisers through our net new asset metric would have been even stronger after adjusting for this separation, which we do not believe will negatively impact our profitability.\nDuring the prior 12 months, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $282 million of trailing 12-month production and nearly $38 billion of client assets at their previous firms. Total clients' domestic sweep suite and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion, up 11% from March of 2023.\nThe enhanced savings program with its competitive rate and robust FDIC insurance continue to attract significant cash this quarter, offsetting a decline in client sweep balances, largely due to quarterly fee billings and tax payments in April. Total bank loans decreased 1% from the preceding quarter to $43 billion, primarily reflecting a modest decline in corporate loans as new origination demand continues to be tepid in the market.\nMoving to Slide 6. Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $2.18 billion and pretax income of $411 million. Year-over-year asset-based revenues declined due to market decline. However, PCG results were lifted by the benefit of higher interest rates and interest-related revenues and fees.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $276 million and a pretax loss of $34 million. Revenues declined 28% compared to the prior year quarter, mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues. The extremely challenging market environment, particularly for investment banking, has strained the near-term profitability of the segment's results.\nAs we explained at Analyst and Investor Day, the segment's results are negatively impacted by amortization of share-based compensation for prior years as well as growth investments. However, we are focused on managing controllable expenses as near-term revenues are depressed. The Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $89 million on net revenues of $226 million. The increase in net revenues and pretax income over the preceding quarter were largely the result of higher assets and fee-based accounts.\nThe Bank segment generated net revenues of $514 million and pretax income of $66 million. Third quarter NIM for the Bank segment of 3.26%, rose 85 basis points over the year ago quarter, but as expected, decreased 37 basis points from the preceding quarter, primarily due to higher funding costs. We continue to add diverse higher-cost funding sources and shifted more of the lower-cost sweep funding to third-party banks.\nWhile this negatively impacted the Bank segment's NIM, Paul Shoukry will walk us through how this benefits both clients and the firm overall. Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7. We generated record net revenues of $8.6 billion and record net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion, up 5% and 22%, respectively, over the prior year's records.\nWe aren't seeing many other firms in our industry generate record so far this year. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.7% for the 9-month period. On Slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Bank segments for the first 9 months of the year primarily reflects the benefit of strong organic growth in the Private Client Group, the successful integration of TriState Capital and higher interest-related revenues.\nWhen compared to the record activity levels in the year ago period, weaker capital markets results reflect the challenging environment for investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenue, despite incremental revenues from the SumRidge acquisition. And now I'll turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Starting on Slide 10. Consolidated net revenues were a record $2.91 billion in the third quarter, up 7% over the prior year and 1% sequentially. Being able to generate record quarterly revenues during a period when capital market revenues were so challenged across the industry reinforces the value of having diverse and complementary businesses anchored by the Private Client Group business, which reached record client assets this quarter.\nAsset Management and related administrative fees declined 4% compared to the prior year quarter and increased 5% sequentially, due to the higher assets and fee-based accounts at the end of the preceding quarter, along with 1 additional billable day in the fiscal third quarter.\nThis quarter, fee-based assets grew 5% to a new record, providing a tailwind for Asset Management and related administrative fees in the fiscal fourth quarter. Brokerage revenues of $461 million, declined 10% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. This year-over-year decline was largely due to lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment as well as lower asset-based trail revenues in PCG.\nI'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment Banking revenues of $151 million, declined 32% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. As experience across the industry, both underwriting and M&A revenues continue to be challenged this quarter. We are optimistic that the environment is improving, and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new business activity.\nHowever, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timing of deals launching and closing given the heightened market volatility. So while we may not see significant improvement in the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect better results over the next 6 to 12 months.\nMoving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Saving Program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion, up 11% over the preceding quarter and representing 5.2% of domestic PCG client assets. Advisers continue to serve their clients effectively, leveraging our competitive cash offerings. The Enhanced Savings Program attracted approximately $8.5 billion in new deposits this quarter. A large portion of the total cash coming in to ESP has been new cash brought to the firm by advisers, highlighting the attractiveness of this product and Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability.\nThe Enhanced Savings Program balances exceeded $11.9 billion this week, continuing to grow modestly and partially offsetting the decline in sweep balances, largely due to the approximately $1.3 billion of quarterly fee billings in July. As I said on last quarter's call, it feels like we are closer to the end of the cash sorting dynamic than we are to the beginning. And we have certainly seen a deceleration of the activity over the past several months.\nHowever, we are not ready to declare the end of that dynamic. We will need more time with stable balances and interest rates. This quarter's sweep balances with third-party banks increased $7.5 billion to $16.9 billion, giving us a large funding cushion when attractive growth opportunities surface. These third-party balances grew faster than we expected last quarter as a strong growth of Enhanced Saving Program balances at Raymond James Bank allowed for more balances to be deployed off balance sheet.\nWhile this dynamic has negatively impacted the Bank segment's NIM because of the geography of the lower-cost sweet balances being swept off balance sheet, it ultimately provides clients with an attractive deposit solution while also optimizing the firm's funding flexibility. Looking forward, we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth.\nTurning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $708 million, up 91% over the prior year quarter and down 3% compared to the preceding quarter. The sequential decrease in firm-wide net interest income was partially offset by higher RJBDP fees from third-party banks.\nIf you recall, on our last earnings call, we anticipated a 10% decline in these interest-related revenues. So we are pleased with the better-than-expected decline of just 3%, which was partly a function of higher-than-anticipated growth of Enhanced Saving Program balances.\nThe Bank segment's net interest margin decreased 37 basis points sequentially to 3.26% for the quarter, and the average yield of RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 12 basis points to 3.37%. While there are many variables that will impact the actual results, we currently expect combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to be around 5% lower in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the fiscal third quarter as we expect some further contraction of the Bank segment net interest income to be partially offset by an increase in RJBDP fees from third-party banks.\nAs we have always said, instead of concentrating on maximizing NIM over the near term, we are more focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income and RJBDP fees over the long term, which we believe we are well positioned to do. Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Compensation expense was $1.85 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 63.7%. The adjusted compensation ratio was 62.7% during the quarter, which we are very pleased with, especially given the challenging environment for capital markets.\nNon-compensation expenses of $570 million, increased 15% sequentially. As Paul mentioned earlier, the quarter included elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million and a bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million. The $65 million of provisions for legal and regulatory matters was made up of several items that all hit this quarter. Some of those items were closed out and publicly disclosed and some of the other items are still in process, and we, therefore, will not be able to provide much more detail on those in this call.\nAdditionally, this quarter included seasonally higher conference and event-related expenses. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of $54 million, increased $26 million over the preceding quarter, largely reflecting weaker assumptions for commercial real estate valuations in the Moody's CRE price index and in particular, the office price index, which resulted in higher allowances.\nI'll discuss more related to the credit quality in the Bank segment shortly. In summary, while there has been some noise with elevated legal and regulatory matters over the past 2 quarters, none of the other noncompensation expenses are coming in too much differently than we expected when we last provided guidance for the fiscal year.\nBut as you all know, legal and regulatory expenses and provisions for loan losses using the CECL methodology are inherently difficult to predict. Importantly, we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth in ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.\nSlide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. In the current quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 16.7% and an adjusted pretax margin of 18.1%, a strong result given the industry-wide challenges impacting capital markets and the aforementioned provisions.\nOn Slide 15, at quarter end, total assets were $78 billion, a 2% sequential decrease, largely reflecting lower client cash balances in CIP during the quarter. Liquidity and capital remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target.\nThe Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.4% and total capital ratio of 22% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized. The 11.4% Tier 1 leverage ratio reflects over $1 billion of excess capital, above our conservative 10% target, which would still be 2x the regulatory requirement to be well capitalized.\nOur capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth. We also have significant sources of contingent funding. We have a $750 million revolving credit facility, which was recently renewed and upsized in April, and nearly $10 billion of FHLB capacity in the Bank segment.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the fiscal third quarter, the firm repurchased 3.31 million shares of common stock for $300 million at an average price of nearly $91 per share. As of July 26, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization. And we currently intend on continuing our planned repurchases as we have discussed previously.\nLastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter to just 0.94%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just 1.04%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 1.9% at the quarter end.\nWe believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints, higher interest rates and the potential recession on the corporate loan portfolio. As we have done from time to time when we believe there's an attractive risk reward, during the quarter, we proactively sold approximately $450 million of corporate loans at an average price of around 98% of par value.\nThere continues to be a lot of attention in the commercial real estate across the industry, given the challenges with property values and interest rates. So let me briefly cover our portfolio. Across the Bank segment, we have CRE and REIT loans of approximately $8.8 billion, which represents 20% of total loans. Our office portfolio is $1.4 billion, only representing approximately 3% of the Bank segment's total loans.\nOverall, we have deliberately limited the exposure to office real estate, and we underwrote office loans with what we believe were conservative criteria, but we will continue to monitor each loan closely, given the industry-wide challenges. Now I will turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. As I said at the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023 and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a challenging environment. And while there is still a near-term economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength and are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses.\nIn the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the 5% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts. And I'm optimistic over the long term, we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology and product solutions.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, there are some signs of improvement in investment banking, and we continue to have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels. But while there is reason for optimism, we expect the pace and timing of transactions to be heavily influenced by market conditions and would more likely pick up over the next 6 to 12 months.\nIn the fixed income space, depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. We hope that once rates and cash balances stabilize, we could start to see an improvement. So while there are some near-term challenges over the long term, we believe the Capital Markets business is well positioned for growth given the investments we've made over the last 5 years and have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share.\nWe will continue to prudently manage expenses in these businesses as near-term revenues continue to come under pressure. Obviously, we'll have to take more significant action if the industry headwinds proved to be more long term.\nIn the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal fourth quarter up 3% compared to the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive throughout the quarter. We remain confident that strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.\nIn addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution and operational and marketing synergies. In the Bank segment, our focus over the next several months will continue to be fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand.\nWe have seen securities-based loan payoffs decelerate and expect demand for those loans to essentially recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates. With little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been tepid. However, we believe the yield environment has improved with ample cash sitting with third-party banks and lots of capital, we are well positioned to lend once activity picks up.\nIn closing, we have strong prospects for future growth given our strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses and our ample capital and liquidity. I want to take this time to thank our advisers and associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day, especially in these uncertain times when clients need trusted advice the most.\nThank you all for what you do. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. Now we'll turn it over to Kristie Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial.\n\nKristina Waugh\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. With us on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, Chief Financial Officer. The presentation being reviewed today is available on Raymond James' Investor Relations website. Following the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions.\nCalling your attention to Slide 2. Please note certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions and our level of success integrating acquired businesses, divestitures, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments or economic conditions.\nIn addition, words such as may, will, could, anticipates, expects, believes or continue or negative of such terms as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Please note that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in these statements. We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring today's call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedules accompanying our press release and presentation. Now I'll turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Reilly\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. Paul and I are joining you from Orlando, Florida. We have over 4,000 people attending our independent advisers conference. It's great to see such an upbeat mood and people really having a good time getting back together as well as all the other educational sessions we have here. Since our founding over 60 years ago, Raymond James has maintained an unwavering commitment to placing clients first through conservative decision-making that keeps us well positioned over the long term. While remaining focused on the long term has not always been easy or fully appreciated in good times, it has served us very well over time. And it's in times such as these when even the financial system itself is challenged that our philosophy not only carries us through but enables us to thrive.\nJust a few examples of our differentiated positioning that we have benefited recently from includes Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 11.5%, over 2x the regulatory requirement to be well capitalized. 88% of our bank deposits are FDIC insured, including nearly 95% of Raymond James Bank amongst the highest in the entire industry, and A-level rating with all 3 credit agencies, which Fitch reaffirmed in March at the height of the turmoil.\nA few weeks later, we were able to renew and upsize our 5-year committed revolver with enhanced terms, thanks to the fantastic relationship we have with all of our bank partners. Further, we were able to buy back 350 million of shares at what we believe were attractive prices. And we still have $1.1 billion of capacity remaining under our Board authorization. In times like these, we are reminded of the importance of keeping a long-term client-focused approach and our stakeholders benefit and appreciate the firm's dedication to placing them first.\nNow turning to our results. Despite the challenging market and the high market volatility during the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we generated record net revenues and record earnings. Reviewing second quarter results, starting on Slide 4. The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.9 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $425 million or $1.93 per diluted share. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $446 million or $2.03 per diluted share.\nThe increase in interest-related revenues driven by short-term interest rates drove significant earnings growth over the prior year. Net revenue increased 7% and net income available to common shareholders grew 32%. And despite the challenging market conditions and our robust capital position, we generated strong returns with annualized return on common equity of 70.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.3%.\nMoving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of $1.2 trillion, PCG assets in fee-based accounts of $666 billion and financial assets under management of $194 billion. With our continued focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisers, PCG consistently generates strong organic growth, which is evident again this quarter with domestic net new assets of $21.5 billion, representing an 8.4% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.\nDuring the prior 12 months, we recruited, through our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $275 million of trailing 12 production and nearly $38 billion of client assets at their previous firm. Total clients' domestic sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $52.2 billion, down 14% from December of 2022. The sequential decline reflects the expected cash sorting activity, which was partially offset by the launch of our Enhanced Savings Program. We are pleased with the early success of our Enhanced Savings Program. This product offered to PCG clients, the Raymond James Bank is a fantastic option for clients seeking competitive rates while maintaining a high level of FDIC insurance. We believe this product is really unique in the industry and certainly appealing in the current environment. As of this week, Enhanced Savings Program balances have surpassed $4.5 billion.\nTotal bank loans decreased to 1% from the preceding quarter to $44 billion, primarily reflecting a modest decline in securities-based loans due to higher interest rate environment. We will touch on this more later on the call, but we plan to remain very prudent with growing our corporate loans over the next several months given volatile market conditions.\nMoving to Slide 6. Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenue of $2.14 billion and pretax income of $441 million. Year-over-year, asset-based revenues declined due to market declines. However, PCG's results were lifted by the benefit of higher interest rates and interest-related revenues and fees. As Paul Shoukry will explain in more detail, this quarter was negatively impacted by some seasonal expenses as well as elevated legal costs. The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $302 million and a pretax loss of $34 million. Revenues declined 27% compared to the prior year quarter mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues. The extremely challenging market environment, particularly for investment banking, has strained the near-term profitability of the segment. However, we are focused on managing controllable expenses as near-term revenues are depressed.\nThe Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $82 million on net revenues of $216 million. The year-over-year decreases in net revenue and pretax income were largely attributable to lower assets and fee-based accounts as net inflows into fee-based accounts and the Private Client Group were offset by market declines.\nSolid net inflows for Raymond James Investment Management helped boost financial assets under management, which should provide a tailwind in the fiscal third quarter. The bank segment generated record net revenues of $540 million and pretax income of $91 million. Revenue growth was largely due to the continued expansion of the bank's net interest margin to 3.63% for the quarter, up 162 basis points over the year ago quarter and 27 basis points from the preceding quarter. The NIM expansion reflected the flexible and floating nature of our balance sheet. Although as Paul Shoukry will explain, we do expect some headwinds to NIM, which reached very high levels across the industry over the past couple of months.\nLooking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7. We generated record net revenues of $5.66 billion and record net income available to common shareholders of $932 million, up 4% and 21%, respectively, over the prior year's record. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 19.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 24.2% for the 6-month period.\nOn Slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Bank segment for the first half of the year primarily reflects the strong organic growth in PCG and the benefit of higher interest-related revenues, whereas the weaker Capital Markets results reflected the challenging environment for investment banking and brokerage revenues, especially when compared to the record activity levels in the year ago period.\nAnd now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of the second quarter financials. Paul?\n\nPaul Shoukry\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Treasurer & Head of Investor Relations, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Starting on Slide 10. Consolidated net revenues were a record $2.87 billion in the second quarter, up 7% over the prior year and 3% sequentially. Being able to generate record quarterly revenues during a period when Capital Market revenues were so challenged across the industry reinforces the value of having diversified and complementary businesses. Asset management and related administrative fees declined 11% compared to the prior year quarter and increased 5% sequentially due to the higher assets and fee-based accounts at the end of the preceding quarter, partially offset by fewer billable days in the fiscal second quarter. This quarter, fee-based assets grew 5%, providing a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal third quarter.\nBrokerage revenues of $496 million declined 12% year-over-year and grew 2% sequentially. This year-over-year decline was largely due to lower asset-based trail revenues in PCG as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment.\nI'll discuss account service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment banking revenues of $154 million declined 34% year-over-year and grew 9% sequentially. As experienced across the industry, M&A revenues were particularly challenged this quarter, declining 37% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Despite a healthy banking pipeline and solid new business activity, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timings of deals launching and closing, given the heightened market volatility. It remains too difficult to say when conditions will become conducive to increase investment banking revenues.\nMoving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $52.2 billion, down 14% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 4.9% of domestic PCG client assets. The Enhanced Savings Program added approximately $2.7 billion in new deposits in March as the offering was only open to net new balances until April. And a good portion of these new balances were derived from brand-new clients to the firm following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, highlighting the attractiveness of this product and Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability.\nAs Paul said, the Enhanced Savings Program balances exceeded $4.5 billion this week, continuing to grow nicely and partially offsetting the anticipated decline in sweep balances, largely due to quarterly fee billings in April. So while it's difficult to parse through the disclosures to make sure we're comparing apples to apples, of the handful of peers who have reported thus far, we estimate year-over-year cash sweep declines for those peers were approximately 35% to 45%. This compares to a 35% year-over-year decline in our domestic sweep balances through March. So this dynamic of declining sweep balances has really been experienced at roughly the same order of magnitude for most of the firms in our industry. And as most of you know, we have been expecting, communicating and preparing for the sorting activity for quite some time.\nLooking forward, we expect additional cash sorting activity, although we believe we are much closer to the end of that dynamic than we are to the beginning if rates settle out near current levels, and the average sweep balance per account over the approximately 3.4 million accounts domestically is now less than $15,000. We hope to continue to offset any further cash sorting activities through our diversified funding sources, including the Enhanced Savings Program, TriState deposit franchise and other initiatives. And when the sorting dynamic does stabilize, we would then expect to grow sweep balances given our strong organic growth in PCG.\nMeanwhile, to be prudent, we would strive to maintain a strong funding cushion of domestic cash swept to third-party banks, not too much lower than where it ended the March quarter. We would also plan to keep elevated cash balances in the Bank segment, which grew from $1.8 billion in December to $5 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. While these actions don't optimize net interest margin over the short term, we believe they give us the most flexibility over the long term.\nTurning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party bank was $731 million, up 226% over the prior year quarter and 1% over the preceding quarter as a sequential decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks was more than offset by higher firm-wide net interest income. The Bank segment's net interest margin increased 27 basis points sequentially to 3.63% for the quarter, and the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 53 basis points to 3.25%. Our long-standing approach of maintaining a high concentration of floating rate assets not only helped drive more immediate upside to higher short-term interest rates but also preserve a relatively flexible balance sheet compared to the banks that had much higher concentration of duration risk.\nLooking forward, we expect combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to decline sequentially in fiscal third quarter due to a decrease in third-party RJBDP fees given the lower average balances with third-party banks. We would also expect the bank segments NIM to contract from the second quarter given the higher level of cash balances we plan to maintain during this volatile period as well as the impact from higher cost diversified funding sources. But as we have always said, instead of focusing on maximizing NIM, we are focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income over the long term, which we still believe we are well positioned to do after the cash sorting dynamic is behind us. But near term, we expect headwinds for the net interest income and RJBDP fees for the reasons I just explained.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Compensation expense was $1.8 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 63.3%. The adjusted compensation ratio was 62.8% during the quarter. The compensation ratio continues to benefit from higher net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks. The sequential increase in compensation reflects higher revenues as well as the impact of salary increases effective on January 1, along with the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year. We are very pleased to generate a 62.8% adjusted compensation ratio given these factors and the extremely challenging market environment for Capital Markets.\nNon-compensation expenses of $496 million increased 25% sequentially. Adjusting for acquisition-related non-compensation expenses and the favorable settlement received in the fiscal first quarter, which are all included in our non-GAAP earning adjustments, non-compensation expenses grew 16% during the quarter. This increase was largely driven by higher legal and regulatory costs including an unfavorable arbitration award totaling $20 million, along with higher communication and information processing expenses, which reflect continued technology investments and the seasonal impact of year-end mailing. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of $28 million largely reflects the charge-off of a C&I loan has been challenged for several quarters as well as higher allowances in the CRE portfolio. I'll discuss more related to the credit quality of the Bank segment shortly.\nIn summary, we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. While there has been some noise with elevated legal and regulatory expenses this quarter and there are always some seasonal expenses that hit in the first calendar quarter of the year, none of the non-compensation expenses are coming in too much differently than we expected when we last provided guidance for the fiscal year. But legal and regulatory expenses are inherently difficult to predict.\nSlide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. In the current quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 19.4% and adjusted pretax margin of 20.4%, the strong result given the industry-wide challenges impacting capital markets.\nOn Slide 15. At quarter end, total assets were $79 billion, a 3% sequential increase largely reflecting the $3.2 billion increase of cash balances in the Bank segment during the quarter. Liquidity and capital remains very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.5% and total capital ratio of 21.4% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized. The 11.5% Tier 1 leverage ratio reflects over $1 billion of excess capital above our conservative 10% target, which would still be 2x the regulatory requirement to be well capitalized. Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.\nWe were pleased to have our A- credit rating reaffirmed by Fitch in mid-March. In the announcement, Fitch cited the firm's strong capital cushion, significant deposit funding and access to unsecured debt markets, among other drivers as the reason for the rating. Also in April, we renewed our revolving credit facility and expanded it from $500 million to $750 million. A strong balance sheet and long-standing relationships with our banking partners enabled us to upsize the 5-year committed corporate revolver with enhanced terms to further strengthen our contingent liquidity sources. The ability to execute this facility in a challenging market environment is a testament to our long-term conservative approach. I know many of our bankers are listening on this call, so I'd like to thank all of you for your continued support and partnership.\nWe also have other significant sources of contingent funding. For example, just to be proactive, given the market uncertainty in March, we increased our FHLB borrowings in the bank segment by only $500 million from December 31 to March 31. And given our strong cash position, we've already paid $200 million of that down in April. That leaves us more than $9 billion of FHLB capacity in the Bank segment.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the fiscal second quarter, the firm repurchased 3.75 million shares of common stock for $350 million at an average price of $93 per share. As of April 26, approximately $1.1 billion remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization. And we currently intend on continuing our planned repurchases as we discussed previously, particularly as this market volatility has provided attractive opportunities for us, and we don't plan on using as much capital to support balance sheet growth over the next 3 to 6 months.\nLastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for the Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality loan portfolio remains healthy. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just 0.92%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 0.94%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 1.67% at quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints, higher interest rates and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio.\nI know there's been a lot of attention on commercial real estate across the industry, given the challenges with property value and interest rates. So let me briefly cover our portfolio. Across the Bank segment, we have CRE and REIT loans approximately $8.8 billion, which represents 20% of our total loans. Our office portfolio is only 17% of these real estate loans. So our office portfolio only represents approximately 3.5% of the Bank segment's total loans. Based on the underwriting and origination along with the most recent appraisals, the average loan-to-value of this office portfolio is somewhere around 60%, which is probably a little bit higher now, given pressure on valuations in the industry, but still providing us a lot of cushion on this portfolio on average. Overall, we have deliberately limited the exposure to office real estate, and we underwrote office loans with what we believe are conservative criteria, but we continue to monitor each loan closely given the industry-wide challenges.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Reilly\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. And as I said at the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results for the first 6 months of fiscal 2023 and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a very volatile market. And while there is still a lot of near-term economic uncertainty, we are in a position of strength, and I believe we are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses.\nIn the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the 5% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts. However, we do expect to have some headwinds from lower RJBDP fees from third-party banks, given lower average balances. Focusing more on the long term, I'm optimistic we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and our leading technology and product solutions.\nFor example, in our current adviser recruiting pipeline, we have several commitments from teams with $5 million to $20 million of annual production. In the Capital Markets segment, while M&A pipelines remain healthy and engagement levels are good, the pace and timing of launching and closing transactions will be challenged until market conditions stabilize. And in the fixed income space, the depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity.\nHowever, SumRidge enhances our position as this business typically benefits from elevated rate volatility and has produced excellent results since joining us. While we expect continued industry-wide challenges over the next couple of quarters, over the long term, we are well positioned across the capital markets business for growth given the investments we made over the past 5 years, which have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share.\nWe will continue to prudently manage expenses in these businesses as the near-term revenues continue to come under pressure. Obviously, we will take more significant actions if the industry headwinds prove to be more long term. In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third quarter, up 5% compared to the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive throughout the fiscal third quarter.\nWe remain confident that strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management, which generated solid net inflows this quarter to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution, operational and marketing synergies. In the Bank segment, our focus over the next several months will continue to be fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding source.\nWhile we'll continue to support our PCG clients when their demand for loans eventually recover, we will be very prudent in growing corporate loans given market uncertainty. We believe there will be more attractive opportunities in the future as spreads widen to reflect the higher cost of funding and our higher premium required for credit risk across the entire banking industry.\nAnd just as we did during uncertain market environments in the past, we have been and will continue to be opportunistic in selling certain loans to further derisk the corporate portfolio, especially when we believe the secondary market prices do not fully reflect the downside risk. So overall, our approach to the Bank segment over the next 3 to 6 months is to build as much dry powder as possible for what we believe will be a more attractive and opportunistic environment for loan growth in fiscal 2024.\nIn closing, we believe we are well positioned with strong prospects for future growth and ample cash and liquidity. Uncertain times like these are when clients need trusted advice the most. And I want to thank our advisers and their associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day. The strength and stability of our firm is a direct reflection of your commitment. So thank you all for all you do.\nAnd with that, operator, that concludes my remarks, and we'll open up the line for questions."

We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. With us on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, Chief Financial Officer. The presentation being reviewed today is available on Raymond James' Investor Relations website. Following the prepared remarks, the operator will open the line for questions.\nCalling your attention to Slide 2. Please note certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions and our level of success in integrating acquired businesses, divestitures, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments or general economic conditions. In addition, words such as may, will, could, anticipates, expects, believes or continue or a negative of such terms or other comparable terminology as well as any other statements that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nPlease note that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring today's call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedules accompanying our press release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Although there is a lot of disappointment for us in the Bucks' playoff game and even more disappointment for me is Paul Shoukry's Bulldogs won the National Championship, Raymond James came through again with another good, solid performance.\nDuring a volatile and challenging market environment, we generated strong quarterly results, including record net income available to common shareholders of $507 million, annualized return on common equity of 21.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 26.1%. Once again, these results highlight the value of having diverse and complementary businesses.\nRecord Private Client Group results driven by robust organic growth, along with strong expansion of net interest margins in the Bank segment and yields on the RJBDP balances at third-party banks in the PCG segment, offset market-driven declines experienced through the Capital Markets businesses.\nAs demonstrated this quarter, with the sharp increase in net interest income and RJBDP fees, we have been and remain well positioned for continued rise in short-term interest rates with diverse and ample funding sources, a high concentration of floating rate assets and strong balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios.\nTurning now to the results starting on Slide 4. In the first fiscal quarter, the firm reported net revenues of $2.79 billion, record pretax income of $652 million and record net income available to common shareholders of $507 million or $2.30 per diluted share. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions and the favorable impact of a $32 million insurance settlement received during the quarter, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $505 million or $2.29 per diluted share.\nQuarterly net revenues were flat compared to the prior year quarter and down 2% compared to the preceding quarter largely driven by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates on net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, offset by the market-driven declines in investment banking revenues and asset management and related administrative fees. Record quarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 14% over the prior year's fiscal first quarter largely due to higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we generated very strong returns, with annualized return on common equity of 21.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 26.1%. Impressive results, especially given the challenging market conditions and our strong capital position.\nMoving on to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of $1.17 trillion, PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $633 billion and financial assets under management of $186 billion. With our unwavering focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisers, PCG consistently generates strong organic growth. We ended the quarter with nearly 8,700 financial advisers and generated domestic net new assets of $23 billion in the quarter, representing a 9.8% annualized growth rate on beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.\nNet new assets were strong this quarter and also helped by the seasonally high interest and dividends received in December. Over the trailing 12-month period, we generated net new asset growth of 7.3% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. During the same 12-month period, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisers with nearly $300 million of trailing 12-month production and approximately $40 billion of client assets at their previous firms.\nTotal clients' domestic cash sweep balances declined 10% to $60 billion, representing 5.9% of domestic PCG assets under administration. The domestic suite balances represent our lowest cost deposits as we have yet to utilize enhanced yield savings accounts to attract cash deposits. Total bank loans grew 2% sequentially to a record $44 billion, reflecting growth at both Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank.\nMoving to Slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $2.06 billion and pretax income of $434 million. Asset-based revenues declined. However, the segment's results were lifted by the benefit from higher short-term interest rates, including increased yields on RJBDP fees from third-party banks and the Bank segment.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $295 million and a pretax loss of $16 million. Capital Markets revenues declined 52% compared to the record-setting results in the prior year and quarter, mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues largely due to the volatile and uncertain markets.\nThe Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $80 million on net revenues of $207 million. The decreases in net revenue and pretax income were largely attributable to lower financial assets under management as the net inflows to fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group were offset by a year-over-year fixed income and equity markets decline.\nThe Bank segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $508 million and pretax income of $136 million. Net revenue growth was primarily due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the bank's net interest margin to 3.36% for the quarter, up 144 basis points over a year ago quarter and 45 basis points from the preceding quarter, reflecting the flexible and floating rate nature of our balance sheet.\nAnd now for a more detailed review of our financial first quarter results, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul.\nStarting with consolidated revenues on Slide 8. Quarterly net revenues of $2.79 billion were flat year-over-year and declined 2% sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees declined 10% compared to the prior year quarter and 4% compared to the preceding quarter, in line with the guidance we provided on last quarter's call based on lower fee-based assets at the end of the preceding quarter due to the equity market declines.\nThis quarter, fee-based assets grew 8%. This growth should provide a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees, which we expect to increase 5% to 6% in the fiscal second quarter, reflecting 2 fewer billable days.\nBrokerage revenues of $484 million declined 13% compared to the prior year's fiscal first quarter and grew 1% over the preceding quarter. The year-over-year decline was largely due to lower fixed income and equity brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment as well as lower asset-based trail revenues in PCG. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly.\nIn a much more difficult market environment than we anticipated on last quarter's call, investment banking revenues of $141 million declined 67% compared to the record set in the prior year quarter and 35% compared to the preceding quarter. Despite a healthy pipeline and good engagement levels, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timing of deal closings given the heightened market volatility. At this point, it is too difficult to say when conditions will become conducive to increased creativity.\nOther revenues of $44 million declined 45% sequentially primarily due to lower revenues in the affordable housing investments business, which was seasonally high in the preceding quarter. Looking forward, this business continues to have a strong pipeline.\nMoving to Slide 9. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $60.4 billion, down 10% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 5.9% of domestic PCG client assets. The sweep balance declines were experienced in the Client Interest Program at the broker-dealer as well as with third-party banks. As of last Friday, these balances have declined to just under $57 billion, reflecting the quarterly fee payments of approximately $1.1 billion paid in January as well as additional cash sorting activity during the month.\nThe Raymond James Bank Deposit Sweep Program (sic) [Raymond James Bank Deposit Program] continues to be a relatively low-cost source of funding, and TriState Capital Bank adds an independent deposit franchise, providing a more diversified funding base. And as we have seen deposits declined significantly across the entire financial system, we realize even greater value in having multiple funding sources. To that end, we are also in the process of launching an enhanced yield savings program for our Private Client Group clients.\nTurning to Slide 10. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $723 million, up 253% over the prior year's fiscal first quarter and 19% over the preceding quarter. This strong growth reflects the immediate impact from higher short-term rates given the limited duration and high concentration of floating rate assets on our balance sheet. Our long-standing approach has been to maintain a high concentration of floating rate assets, which is proving to be a significant tailwind in this rising rate environment.\nThe bank's net interest margin shown on the bottom portion of the slide increased 45 basis points sequentially to 3.36% for the quarter. And the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 87 basis points to 2.72%. Both the NIM and the average yield on RJBDP balances increased more than we expected on last quarter's call as a deposit beta on the last rate increase was closer to 15%.\nThe spot NIM for the Bank segment is currently close to 3.5%, and the spot yield on RJBDP balances is approximately 3.2%. So we currently expect continued near-term tailwinds for net interest income and related fees despite the ongoing cash sorting activity. The anticipated rate increases should also help. But remember, there are 2 fewer days in the second fiscal quarter.\nWhile we still have sweep balances with third-party banks that could be redeployed to the Bank segment, longer term, if rates stabilize at these levels, we expect the bank's NIM will be impacted by the mix of deposits, anticipating a larger portion of higher cost deposits being utilized to fund the future balance sheet growth.\nWhile we are pleased to see the significant NIM expansion, as we have said in the past, we have always prioritized net interest income over net interest margin. And our goal is to continue growing net interest income as we deliberately grow the balance sheet over time.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. Beginning with our largest expense, compensation. The total compensation ratio for the quarter was 62.3%, nearly flat from the preceding quarter. The adjusted compensation ratio was 61.7% during the quarter. Despite lower Capital Markets revenues, the compensation ratio largely reflects the significant benefit from higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks.\nAs a reminder, the impact of salary increases effective on January 1 and the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year will be reflected in the fiscal second quarter. Noncompensation expenses of $398 million decreased 13% sequentially. Adjusting for acquisition-related noncompensation expenses of $11 million and the favorable impact received of $32 million, both included in our non-GAAP earnings adjustments, noncompensation expenses were $419 million during the quarter.\nThe bank loan provision for credit losses of $14 million in the quarter primarily reflects changes to macroeconomic assumptions used in the CECL models as well as modest loan growth. I'm proud of our continued disciplined management of expenses exhibited again this quarter where we remain focused on investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.\nGiven the benefits from higher short-term interest rates, we expect to maintain our compensation ratio well below 66% as it has been around 62% over the past 2 quarters, even with much lower revenues in the Capital Markets segment this quarter. Noncompensation expenses, excluding provision for credit losses and the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments, are still expected to be around $1.7 billion for the fiscal year.\nSlide 12 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. In the fiscal first quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 23.4%, a very strong result, highlighting the benefit of our diversified business model, the upside we preserve, the higher short-term interest rates and our consistent focus on being disciplined on expenses.\nSimilar to my comments on the compensation ratio, given the interest rate tailwinds, we currently believe we are well positioned to continue delivering pretax margins above the previously disclosed 19% to 20% target. However, given the cash sorting dynamics as well as interest rate and market uncertainty, we believe it is premature to formally update our targets in this volatile environment.\nOn Slide 13, at quarter end, total assets were $77 billion, a 5% sequential decrease, primarily reflecting the decline in Client Interest Program cash balances. The reduction of balance sheet assets helped increase the Tier 1 leverage ratio during the quarter.\nLiquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. The Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.3%, the total capital ratio of 21.5% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized. Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9%, reflecting a tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation that vested during the period. Going forward, we still believe 24% to 25% is an appropriate estimate to use in your models.\nSlide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In December, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common shares 24% to $0.42 per share and authorized share repurchases of up to $1.5 billion, replacing the previous authorization of $1 billion. During the fiscal first quarter, the firm repurchased 1.29 million shares of common stock for $138 million at an average price of $106 per share. As of January 25, 2023, $1.4 billion remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization.\nSince the closing of the TriState acquisition, on June 1 through January 25, we have repurchased approximately 3 million common shares for $300 million or approximately $100 per share under the Board authorization. We remain committed to offset the share issuance associated with the acquisition of TriState as well as share-based compensation dilution and still expect to achieve our objective of repurchasing $1 billion of shares in fiscal 2023. But of course, we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we plan for these repurchases over the coming quarters.\nLastly, on Slide 15, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains healthy. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.01%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 0.92%, down from 1.18% at December 2021, nearly flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline in the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment reflects the higher proportion of securities-based loans largely due to the acquisition of TriState Capital Bank. Securities-based loans, which account for approximately 34% of our bank loan portfolio, are generally collateralized by marketable securities and typically do not require an allowance for credit losses.\nThe bank allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 1.64% at quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul.\nAs I said in the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a very volatile market. And while there are many uncertainties, we believe we're well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses.\nIn the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the expected 5% to 6% sequential increase in asset management and related administrative fees. Additionally, the segment will continue to benefit from higher short-term interest rates, as described by Paul.\nFocusing more on the long term, I am optimistic we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values in leading technology and production solutions.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, while M&A pipelines remain healthy, the pace and timing of closings will be heavily influenced by market conditions. And in the fixed income space, depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity.\nHowever, SumRidge, with its rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace, enhances our position as this business typically benefits from elevated rate volatility. Over the long term, we are well positioned across Capital Markets for growth given the investments we have made over the past 5 years, which have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share.\nIn the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal second quarter up 7% compared to the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive. We remain confident that the strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.\nIn addition, we expect Raymond James investment management, which generated modest net inflows this quarter, to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution, operational and marketing synergies. And the Bank segment is well positioned for rising short-term interest rates and has ample capital to grow the balance sheet prudently. However, in an increasing rate environment, loan growth will face headwinds until rates stabilize and borrowers adjust to a new normal in the cost of borrowings.\nAdditionally, as cash sorting has continued in the sweep program, we expect to increase the focus on funding the growth of the bank's balance sheet with higher costs, diversified sources over the long term. Currently, we have sweep balances at third-party banks that could be redeployed to the Bank segment. However, the past has also taught us that cash sweep balances can decrease or increase rapidly depending on market conditions. Importantly, the credit quality of the Bank segment's loan portfolio remains strong, and we are closely watching economic conditions related to the lending portfolio.\nIn just a short period since the closing of the acquisition of TriState Capital, I am very pleased with their performance. Staying true to TriState's independent operating model, including remaining a separately chartered bank with its own client relationships. This model, coupled with our strong capital, should foster its ongoing growth.\nIt's no accident that our businesses are positioned well for future growth. It is a result of our steady focus on making decisions for the long term, especially in volatile and uncertain market conditions. We are well positioned for the continued rise in short-term interest rates with diverse funding sources, solid loan growth, high concentration of floating rate assets and ample balance sheet flexibility given the solid capital ratios, which are all well in excess of regulatory requirements.\nFinally, in these uncertain times is when clients need trusted advice the most. And I want to thank our advisers and associates for their unwavering dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day. Our strong results are a direct reflection of your contributions. So thank you very much to all of you.\nWith that, operator, will you please open it up for questions?"

Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before I discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings, I want to start by acknowledging the heartbreaking devastation our friends and neighbors as well as over 200 associates on Florida Central Gulf Coast experienced a month ago from Hurricane Ian. While it has been difficult to bear witness to their pain and loss, I also have been humbled by the resilience of our associates, advisers and the community there. Fortunately, our Raymond James family impacted by the storm is safe.\nJust as notable, I can't adequately express my gratitude for our Tampa Bay Area associates who, despite facing an uncertain path from a Category 4 hurricane, worked diligently from remote locations to continue delivering our service-first promise.\nAdditionally, our associates at our corporate locations in Memphis and Southfield and Denver rose to the occasion covering for their coworkers and pitching in where they could and working weekends to catch up.\nFor those without power or other hardships, the home office was open to provide a comfortable and clean place to go. When the home office reopened, the camaraderie was obvious and uplifting. We provided emotional and mental health resources to associates, delivered a $500 relief check to all associates in impacted counties and provided additional time off to help them manage their personal situations. Associates collected 2 semi-trucks of supplies, which were sent to our Fort Myers branch system to be distributed by advisers and associates in their areas. We've heard several heartwarming stories from recipients in these essential supplies, which in itself shows how the collective efforts and generosity truly made a difference for those who needed it most.\nThe firm also responded by raising more than $1 million from corporate, executive leadership and associate donations to assist the recovery and support of those in need through the Red Cross and our friends of Raymond James Charity, who directly help associates with needed emergency funds for repairs and recovery.\nIf I sound surprised, I'm not. The preparation, perseverance and response to the storm reflected the long history of Raymond James service culture, and I'm especially proud to represent our team today.\nNow moving to our results. I'm very pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given the challenging market conditions. Despite the significant decline in equity markets during the year, we still generated record net revenues and record pretax income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Throughout the fiscal year, we remained focused on the long term and continue to invest in our businesses, our people and our technology to help drive growth across our businesses.\nIn the Private Client Group, strong retention and recruiting of financial advisers contributed to industry-leading growth with domestic net new assets of 9% over the fiscal year. Furthermore, the Charles Stanley acquisition completed earlier in the year significantly expanded our presence in the U.K. which is a very attractive market for wealth management.\nIn Capital Markets, annual investment banking results were very strong, only 3% lower than the record results achieved in fiscal 2021. Record M&A revenues helped offset the very challenging underwriting environment. We continue to see strong pipelines for M&A as the expertise we've added both organically and through niche acquisitions has been performing extremely well.\nWe completed the acquisition of SumRidge Partners on July 1, which has enhanced our fixed income platform with technology-driven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive experience dealing with corporates. This business thrives on rate volatility, so SumRidge generated really fantastic results since we closed on the acquisition of July. However, after a record year last year, our legacy fixed income operations serving depositories has been challenged as the Fed intensifies its monetary tightening initiatives.\nIn the Bank segment, loans grew 73% year-over-year and 3% during the quarter, reflecting attractive growth across nearly all loan categories. The acquisition of TriState Capital Bank this year added a best-in-class third-party securities-based lending capability while also diversifying our funding sources. It is in uncertain conditions such as these that reminds us the importance of focusing on and making decisions for the long term.\nAs evidenced this quarter, with a sharp increase in net interest income in RJBDP fees, we are well positioned for the continued rise in short-term interest rates with diverse and ample funding sources, strong loan growth, high concentration of floating rate assets and ample balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios which are well in excess of regulatory requirements.\nWhile some of these attributes may be underappreciated in certain marketed cycles, the value of our long-term approach has really resonated in more volatile and an uncertain market environment we've experienced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.83 billion, record pretax income of $616 million and net income available to common shareholders of $437 million or earnings per diluted share of $1.98. Net income was negatively impacted by the elevated tax rates this quarter due primarily to nondeductible losses on corporate-owned life insurance that we utilize to fund nonqualified benefit plans.\nExcluding $30 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $459 million or $2.08 per diluted share. Year-over-year and sequential revenue growth was driven primarily by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates on both RJBDP fees, from third-party banks, and net interest income, which more than offset the declines in asset management and related administrative fees, and total brokerage revenue, largely due to the decline in equity markets.\nQuarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 2% compared to the prior year's fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the aforementioned revenue growth, which was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses and higher tax rate. Sequentially, quarterly net income grew 46%, driven primarily by the benefit from higher short-term interest rates to the net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, along with lower bank loan provision for credit losses as the prior quarter included the $26 million initial provision for credit losses on loans arising from the acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings.\nAnnualized return on common equity for the quarter was 18.7% and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 24.1%, an impressive result, especially given the challenging market environment and our strong capital position.\nMoving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of $1.09 trillion, PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $586 billion and financial assets under management of $174 billion. Equity market declines in the quarter, including a 5% sequential decline in the S&P 500 Index negatively impacted client asset levels.\nWe ended the quarter with 8,681 financial advisers in PCG, a net increase of 199 over the prior year period and 65 over the preceding quarter. And remember, the year-over-year increase, the adviser count was impacted by transition of advisers to our RIA & Custody Service division, where we typically retain the assets, but we don't include the adviser in our accounts.\nIn the fiscal year, we had 222 financial advisers move to RCS, 166 of which came from 1 firm. Adjusting for these transfers, the numbers of financial advisers increased 421 year-over-year, a really strong result. Our focus on supporting advisers and their clients, especially during uncertain and volatile markets led us to strong results in terms of adviser retention as well as our recruiting of experienced advisers to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options.\nOver the trailing 12-month period ending September 30, 2022, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisers with nearly $320 million of trailing 12 production and approximately $43 billion of client assets at their previous firms.\nAnd highlighting our industry-leading growth, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $95 billion over the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 representing 9% of domestic client assets at the beginning of the period. Fourth quarter domestic PCG net new assets growth was 8.3% annualized.\nTotal client domestic cash sweep balances declined 12% to $67.1 billion or 7% of domestic PCG assets under administration. Paul Shoukry will discuss this more later, but I'd like to highlight that these are lower cost deposits as we have not yet utilized high-yield savings accounts to preserve balances.\nTotal bank loans grew 3% sequentially to a record $43.2 billion, reflecting attractive broad-based growth at both Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank.\nMoving to Slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $1.99 billion and pretax income of $371 million. While asset-based revenues declined, the segment's results were lifted by the benefit from both higher short-term interest rates.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $399 million and pretax income of $66 million. Capital Market revenues declined 28% compared to the prior year period, mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues and fixed income brokerage revenues, largely due to the volatile and uncertain markets.\nThe Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $216 million and pretax income of $83 million. The declines in revenues and pretax income were largely attributable to lower financial assets under management as net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group were offset by fixed income and equity market declines.\nThe Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank generated quarterly net revenue of $428 million, which is a record result and pretax income of $123 million.\nNet revenue growth was mainly due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the Bank's net interest margin to 2.91% for the quarter, up 50 basis points from the preceding quarter, once again, reflecting the flexibility and floating rate nature of our balance sheet. This quarter also included a full quarter of TriState Capital results, which have continued to be solid.\nLooking at the full year fiscal 2022 results on Slide 7. We generated record net revenues of $11 billion and record pretax income of $2 billion, both up 13% over fiscal '21. Record earnings per diluted share of $6.98 increased 5% compared to fiscal 2021. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 17% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 21.1%.\nMoving to the fiscal year segment results on Slide 8. Private Client Group, Asset Management and Bank segments generated record net revenues and the Private Client Group produced record pretax income during the fiscal year, again, reinforcing the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.\nAnd now for more detailed review of the fiscal fourth quarter results, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 10. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.83 billion grew 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Asset management fees declined 6% compared to the prior year's fiscal fourth quarter and 10% compared to the preceding quarter, in line with the guidance we provided on last quarter's call based on fee-based assets.\nEquity markets declined further during the quarter, resulting in a 3% sequential decline in Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts. This decline will create a headwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal first quarter, which I expect to be down close to 4% sequentially in the fiscal first quarter of 2023.\nBrokerage revenues of $481 million declined 11% compared to the prior year's fiscal fourth quarter and 6% compared to the preceding quarter as lower activity and asset-based trail revenues in PCG as well as decreased fixed income brokerage revenues more than offset the addition of SumRidge, which generated strong revenues in the quarter.\nAs Paul touched on, we expect this to be a tough environment for our legacy fixed income business as depository clients have quickly transitioned from having excess deposits to investment securities to experiencing deposit runoff as a result of the Fed's actions. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly.\nInvestment banking revenues of $217 million declined 3% compared to the preceding quarter, a solid result given the challenging and uncertain market environment. And while our pipelines are strong, there remains a lot of uncertainty given the heightened market volatility that could impact investment banking revenues positively or negatively in the coming quarters. Therefore, our best guess right now is that we could achieve a similar level of average quarterly investment banking revenues in fiscal 2023 that we experienced over the last 2 quarters.\nObviously, a lot of variables can and probably will impact that estimate, but that would result in a 20% decline in investment banking revenues in fiscal 2023. That would still represent a much higher level of investment banking revenues than we generated prior to the pandemic as we have made significant investments to the platform over the past few years, which has significantly increased our productive capacity and market share.\nOther revenues of $80 million grew 167% sequentially, primarily due to higher affordable housing investment business revenues, which achieved record results in fiscal 2022.\nMoving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $67.1 billion, down 12% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 7% of domestic PCG client assets. As of this week, these balances have declined to just under $64 billion, reflecting the quarterly fee payments, which were paid in October as well as additional cash sorting activity during the month.\nWhen comparing trends across the industry, it is important to note that these cash sweep balances do not include high-yield saving balances nor do we have a money market sweeps option. So it is sometimes difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons across the industry. Most of the decline in our sweep balances were experienced in the client interest program at the broker-dealer which was really the last-in, first-out destination of the excess deposits over the past couple of years.\nAs we have been explaining for at least a year now, we anticipated a significant decline in these cash balances as the Fed started increasing short-term interest rates. So we kept the CIP balances invested in deposit accounts and short-term treasuries.\nThe Raymond James Bank Deposit Suite Program continues to be a relatively low cost source of stable funding. And now with the addition of TriState Capital Bank's independent deposit franchise, we have a more diversified funding base. And while this additional funding source may not have seemed as valuable several months ago, I think everyone now appreciates just how precious deposits are and the importance of having multiple funding sources.\nTurning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $606 million, up 206% over the prior year's fiscal fourth quarter and 64% from the preceding quarter. This strong growth reflects the immediate impact from higher short-term rates given the limited duration and high concentration of floating rate assets on our balance sheet. While it can sometimes seem appropriate to take more duration and bet on rates, our long-standing approach to maintain a high concentration of floating rate assets is proving to be a significant tailwind in this rising rate environment.\nYou can see on the bottom portion of the slide, the Bank segment's net interest margin increases substantial 50 basis points sequentially to 2.91% for the quarter, and that's on top of the 40 basis point sequential increase in NIM in the preceding quarter. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased nearly 100 basis points to 1.85%. Both the NIM and average yield from third-party banks are expected to increase further with the anticipated rate increases.\nFor the fiscal first quarter, factoring in an expected 75 basis point rate increase in November and some assumptions around deposit beta and other variables, we would expect the average yield on RJBDP from third-party banks for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 to be somewhere around 2.5% and the Bank segment's NIM to average around 3.15%. But these projections will, obviously, be impacted by the actual deposit beta we experienced.\nAs we have done this cycle, we will continue to put clients first and focus on staying on the more generous end of the spectrum for our clients. So far, the cumulative deposit beta since the Fed started increasing rates in March has been around 25%, with the most recent increase in September having a deposit beta of about 35%, less than the 50% we expected, but still much more generous to clients than the vast majority of our competitors.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Beginning with our largest expense, compensation. The total compensation ratio for the quarter was 62.1%, which decreased from 67.5% in the preceding quarter. The adjusted compensation ratio was 61.5% during the quarter. The sequential decline in the compensation ratio largely reflects a significant benefit from higher net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks.\nNon-compensation expenses of $456 million, which includes $13 million of acquisition-related expenses included in our non-GAAP earnings adjustments, decreased 3% sequentially. This quarter reflected a full quarter of expenses from both TriState Capital and SumRidge Partners, which sequentially added just over $25 million of incremental non-compensation expenses, excluding the bank loan loss provision for credit losses. The bank loan loss provision for credit losses decreased to $34 million, primarily due to the $26 million initial provision associated with the TriState Capital acquisition in the fiscal third quarter.\nThis quarter's bank loan provision primarily reflects sequential loan growth along with a weaker macroeconomic outlook used in the CECL models. So as you can see, we remain focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and non-compensation related expenses while still investing heavily in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.\nSlide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 21.8% and an adjusted pretax margin of 22.8%, really excellent results. And just to get ahead of it, I know many of you will ask me, if we will update our 19% to 20% pretax margin target that we laid out at our Analyst and Investor Day in May since we exceeded it this quarter. While that is certainly a reasonable ask. Given the market uncertainty and ongoing cash sorting dynamic, we think it's appropriate to wait at least a few more months to update all of our targets.\nBut with that being said, I think our solid results this quarter highlight the benefit of our diversified business model, the upside we preserve to higher short-term interest rates and our consistent focus on being disciplined on expenses.\nOn Slide 15, at quarter-end, total assets were $81 billion, a 6% sequential decrease primarily reflecting the decline and the client interest program cash balances I mentioned earlier. Liquidity and capital remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.9 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target.\nThe Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.3% and total capital ratio of 20.5% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized. The spot Tier 1 leverage ratio at the end of the quarter is actually closer to 10.5%. So our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 28.7%, up from 27.5% in the preceding quarter, primarily due to nondeductible losses on the corporate-owned life insurance portfolio. Going forward, we still believe around 24% to 25% is an appropriate estimate to use in your models, but in rapidly declining equity markets, the effective tax rate increases as we experienced this quarter and last quarter and vice versa when equity markets increase.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. Since the closing of the TriState acquisition on June 1 through October 26, we have repurchased approximately [2.1] million common shares for $200 million or approximately $96 per share under our Board authorization. As of October 26, 2022, approximately $800 million remained available under the Board-approved share repurchase authorization, which we typically revisit annually in the upcoming Board meeting.\nWe remain committed to offset the share issuance associated with the acquisition of TriState as well as share-based compensation dilution. Therefore, we expect to repurchase on average, $250 million per quarter in fiscal 2023 or $1 billion total for the fiscal year. Of course, we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and other capital and cash needs as we plan for these repurchases over the coming quarters, but I do want to emphasize this $1 billion objective for fiscal 2023.\nLastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which now includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just 1.14%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 0.91%, down from 1.27% at September 2021 and nearly flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline in the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment largely reflects the higher proportion of security-based loans boosted by the acquisition of TriState Capital Bank.\nSecurities-based loans, which account for approximately 35% of net loans are generally collateralized by marketable securities and therefore, typically do not require an allowance for credit losses. If you look at the bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans held for investment as a percentage of the total corporate loans, it was 1.73% at quarter end. Compared to most other banks, we believe this represents a healthy reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. As I stated at the start of our call, I am pleased with our results. And while there are many uncertainties, I believe we're well positioned to drive growth across all of our businesses. In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected 4% sequential decline of asset management fees and related administrative fees that Paul described earlier. Focusing more on the long term, I'm optimistic we'll continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology and production solutions.\nAdditionally, this segment will also continue to benefit from higher short-term interest rates, although we expect cash sorting will continue as the Fed increases short-term interest rates.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, the M&A pipeline remains strong, but the pace and timing of closings will be heavily influenced by market conditions. Over the long term, I am confident we are well positioned for growth given the significant investments we've made over the past 5 years. In the fixed income space, the favorable environment we've experienced over the past couple of years has shifted. Depository clients once flush with cash and facing limited opportunity for loan growth are now experiencing declines in deposits and have less cash available for investing in securities. This dynamic will lead to a challenging environment in fiscal 2023.\nWhile this headwind exists, we expect SumRidge Partners to enhance our current position in the rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace. And SumRidge typically benefits from elevated rate volatility.\nIn the Asset Management segment, the financial assets under management are starting the fiscal year lower due to the decline in equity in fixed income markets. However, we are confident that strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.\nIn addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management, formerly Carillon Tower Associates, to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution, operational and marketing synergies.\nThe Bank segment is well positioned for rising short-term interest rates, and we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet prudently. We will continue to operate TriState Capital Bank as a separately chartered bank and respect its relationships with its clients, which, coupled with our strong capital and funding, should foster its ongoing growth. Most importantly, the credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains strong.\nAs always, I want to thank all of our advisers and associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day. Just as you've observed over the past 2 years, which have been filled with tremendous uncertainty and challenges, we will stay rooted in our commitment to take care of advisers and clients, making decisions for the long term and maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. We believe with this approach, we should be able to continue delivering strong results through different market environments and drive results for our associates, advisers and shareholders, just as we have for the past 60 years.\nWith that, operator, will you please open the line for questions?"

Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. I know with our recent acquisitions, the numbers are a little more complicated, but I am pleased with our results for the fiscal third quarter and the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Despite challenging market conditions, we have continued to invest in our business, our people and technology to help drive growth across all of our businesses.\nIn the Private Client Group, excellent retention and recruiting of financial advisers contributed to industry-leading growth with domestic net new assets of 9.4% over the trailing 12-month period.\nIn the Capital Markets business, while Investment Banking revenues were negatively impacted by continued market volatility during the quarter, we continue to see strong pipelines as the expert we have added both organically and through niche acquisitions has performed very well. In Fixed Income, we completed the acquisition of SumRidge Partners just after the on July 1, which will enhance our platform with technology-driven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive experience in deal and corporates.\nIn June, we completed the acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings including TriState Capital Bank and Chartwell Investment Partners, adding $11.8 billion of loans and $9.4 billion in financial assets under management. In addition to TriState's contribution to our loan portfolio, Raymond James Bank grew loans at an impressive 8% during the quarter, reflecting attractive growth across almost all loan categories.\nSo as we always do in any market cycle, we continue to invest for the long term, always putting the client first. And while the decrease in fee-based assets from the equity market declines during the quarter will negatively impact asset management and related administrative fees in the fourth quarter, we are well positioned for increases in short-term rates given our attractive growth of earning assets, the majority which flowed with the short end of the curve. Furthermore, we have maintained a flexible balance sheet with solid capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements.\nTurning to results on Slide 4. I fully appreciate there were a lot of moving parts this quarter, which Paul Shoukry will explain in more detail. In the fiscal third quarter, the firm reported net revenues of $2.72 billion, and net income available to common shareholders of $299 million, or earnings per diluted share of $1.38. Year-over-year and sequential revenue growth reflects primarily the benefit of higher short-term interest rates on both RJBDP fees from third-party banks and net interest income, which more than offset the declines in total revenues and investment banking revenues resulting from the challenging market environment.\nThe decline in net income available to common shareholders was primarily attributable to increased business development expenses and a higher bank loan provision for credit losses during the current quarter, which reflects the strong growth at Raymond James Bank, a weaker macroeconomic outlook and the $26 million initial provision for the credit losses on loans acquired from TriState Capital Bank, as Paul will discuss in more detail. Excluding $65 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted income available to common shareholders was $348 million or $1.61 per diluted share. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 13.3%, and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 18.1%, an impressive result, especially given the challenging market environment. and our strong capital position.\nMoving to Slide 5. Sharp equity market declines in the quarter, including a 16% sequential decline in the S&P 500 Index negatively impacted client asset levels. We ended the quarter with a total client assets under administration of $1.13 trillion and PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $607 billion. Financial assets under management of $182 billion, which includes Chartwell Investment Partners decreased 6% sequentially as the decline in equity markets more than offset net inflows in the acquired assets during the quarter.\nWe ended the quarter with 8,616 financial advisers, a net increase of 203 over the prior year period and a decrease of 114 compared to the preceding quarter. Results this quarter reflect the transfer of 188 advisers, primarily from 1 firm to our RIA & Custody Services division for RCS during the quarter. While transfers to RCS impact the adviser count, the client assets typically remain custody at the firm. Excluding these transfers, the number of financial advisers increased 74 from the preceding quarter, reflecting our continued low [agreeable attrition] and strong recruiting.\nOur focus on supporting advisers and their clients especially during volatile markets has led to strong results in terms of adviser retention as well as our recruiting of experienced advisers to the Raymond James platforms through our multiple affiliation options. Over the trailing 12-month period ending June 30, 2022, we recruited to our domestic independent contract and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $300 million of trailing 12 production and approximately $47 billion of client assets at their previous firms.\nAnd highlighting our industry-leading growth, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $98 billion over the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2022, representing 9.4% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. Third quarter domestic PCG net new asset growth was 5.4% annualized, a strong result given the impact of client tax payments in the quarter.\nBank loan growth continues to be strong. Raymond James Bank generated impressive loan growth of 26% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to a record $30.1 billion. Additionally, TriState Capital Bank brought over $11.8 billion of loans this quarter which represents a record for them as they have continued to generate very attractive loan growth across their portfolios.\nMoving on to segment results on Slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $1.96 billion and pretax income of $251 million. While asset-based revenues declined, the segment results were lifted by the benefit from higher short-term interest rates.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $383 million and pretax income of $61 million. Capital Markets revenues declined 14% over the prior year period and 7% sequentially, mostly driven by lower fixed income brokerage revenues and equity underwriting revenues due to the volatile and uncertain markets.\nThe Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $228 million and pretax income of $93 million. The sequential decline in revenues and pretax income in the Asset Management segment were primarily attributable to the negative impact on financial assets under management from the decline in equity markets.\nThe Bank segment, which now includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $276 million, which is a record result and pretax income of $74 million. Remember, we closed on TriState Capital on June 1. So this quarter only reflects 1 month of their results.\nNet revenue growth was mainly due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the bank's net interest margin to 2.41% for the quarter, up 40 basis points from the preceding quarter. Despite revenue growth, the bank's segment's pretax income declined primarily due to the aforementioned higher bank loan loss provisions in the quarter.\nLooking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $8.17 billion during the first 9 months of fiscal 2022, up 16% over the same period a year ago. Record earnings per diluted share of $4.99 increased 8% compared to the first 9 months of fiscal 2021. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 16.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 20.1% for the 9-month period.\nMoving to the fiscal year-to-date segment results on Slide 8. All for operating segments generated record net revenues and the Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments generated record pretax income during the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Again, reinforcing the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.\nAnd now for a more detailed view of the third quarter and year-to-date results, I will turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 10. Quarterly net revenues of $2.72 billion grew 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Asset Management fees grew 13% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and declined 3% compared to the preceding quarter, in line with the guidance we provided on last quarter's call.\nAs a result of the steep declines in the equity markets during the quarter, Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts ended the fiscal third quarter down 11% compared to March 2022, creating a significant headwind for Asset Management revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nBrokerage revenues of $513 million declined 7% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 9% compared to the preceding quarter. The decline in brokerage revenues was largely due to lower asset-based trail revenues in the Private Client Group as well as decreased brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment.\nI know some other financial services firms posted year-over-year increases in institutional fixed income brokerage revenues. But remember, we intentionally do not have a meaningful presence in the much more volatile interest rate commodities and currency trading businesses, which benefited many of those larger firms this quarter. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly.\nInvestment Banking revenues of $223 million declined 5% compared to the preceding quarter. While our pipelines are strong, there's a lot of uncertainty given the heightened market volatility. Given the market environment, we are really pleased with the Investment Banking results this quarter, and our best guess right now is that we could achieve a similar result in the fiscal fourth quarter if the markets remain relatively resilient over the next couple of months.\nMoving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $75.8 billion, down 1% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 7.8% of domestic PCG client assets. As of this week, these balances have declined to approximately $73 billion reflecting the quarterly fee payments, which were paid in July and comprised of roughly half the decline this month as well as some continued cash sorting activity during the month.\nTurning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $370 million of an astounding 102% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 65% from the preceding quarter. This revenue growth is largely a result of higher loan balances in the Bank segment as well as higher short-term interest rates which really reinforces our long-standing approach of taking limited duration risk with a high concentration of floating rate assets.\nYou can see on the bottom left portion of the slide, the Bank segment's net interest margin increased a substantial 40 basis points sequentially to 2.41% for the quarter.\nThe average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased to 88 basis points in the quarter. Both the NIM and the average yield from third-party banks are expected to increase further from the recent and anticipated rate increases.\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, factoring in the rate increase this week and some assumptions around deposit beta and other variables we would expect the average yield on RJBDP from third-party banks for the fiscal fourth quarter to average around 1.7%. As for the Bank segments NIM, we expect it to average around 2.7% for the fiscal fourth quarter, which would reflect around 2 months of this week's interest rate increase and a full quarter of TriState Capital's contribution. But these projections will obviously be impacted by the actual deposit beta we experienced.\nWe will continue to put clients first and focus on staying on the more generous end of the spectrum for our clients. So far, our cumulative deposit beta since the Fed start increasing rates in March has been around 20%, but that has accelerated with each subsequent increase to about 30% with the June increase. We would expect the deposit beta to continue increasing with each incremental rate increase.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Let me point out a significant change we made this quarter to our presentation of expenses. Namely, we eliminated the acquisition-related expense line item and now are including all the expenses in their respective line items. At the same time, we are now capturing more acquisition-related expenses in our non-GAAP adjustments including items such as amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets, acquisition-related retention and a bank loan provision item I will discuss in more detail shortly.\nFor example, this quarter, $65 million of expenses related to acquisitions are included in the non-GAAP adjustments. As detailed on the reconciliation table on Slide 21, which provides the amount of associated expense per line item as well as a 5-quarter history. We hope these refinements, which I know have been very common across many of our peers are responsive to many of your requests and help you gain a better understanding of our operating results. And as always, we will emphasize our GAAP results alongside any adjusted results we disclose.\nSo turning to our largest expense, compensation. The total compensation ratio for the quarter was 67.5%, which decreased from 69.3% in the preceding quarter. We also introduced an adjusted total compensation ratio this quarter, which adjusts for acquisition-related retention and compensation as outlined on Slide 23.\nThe adjusted compensation ratio was 66.8% during the quarter. The sequential decline in the compensation ratio largely reflects the benefit from higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks. Non-compensation expenses of $469 million, which includes $47 million of acquisition-related expenses included in our non-GAAP earnings adjustments, increased 21% sequentially.\nBusiness development expenses increased to $58 million, reflecting the adviser recognition events and conferences as well as increased pent-up travel during the quarter.\nTo put this in perspective, prior to COVID, the fiscal third quarter was typically the high watermark for this line item. And in the fiscal third quarter of both 2018 and 2019, this line item totaled $57 million. And since then, our business and revenues have grown substantially, including through several acquisitions. The bank loan provision for credit losses increased considerably to $56 million. A big portion of this increase was a $26 million initial provision associated with TriState Capital acquisition where purchase accounting requires us to establish an initial allowance for loan losses associated with the acquired loans as the pre-closing allowance does not transfer over.\nTo help you with comparability to prior periods, we did adjust for this portion of the bank loan provision in our non-GAAP results. The remaining portion of the bank loan provision during the quarter, around $30 million, was primarily associated with the 8% sequential loan growth at Raymond James Bank and a weaker macroeconomic outlook. Other expenses increased to $85 million for the quarter. The majority of the sequential increase was attributable to increased expenses associated with acquisitions during the quarter, which are included in the non-GAAP adjustments.\nSo I know there's been a lot of noise over the past couple of quarters with the Charles Stanley and TriState Capital acquisitions, but the main takeaway on expenses is we remain focused on the disciplined manage of all compensation and non-compensation-related expenses while still investing heavily in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.\nSlide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. In the fiscal third quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 15.3% and an adjusted pretax margin of 17.7%. While the market environment has certainly become more challenging since our Analyst and Investor Day in May, we still believe the 19% to 20% pretax margin target we laid out is appropriate given the significant benefits of higher short-term interest rates, assuming the market stays relatively resilient at current level.\nOn Slide 15, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $86.1 billion, an 18% sequential increase, reflecting the addition of TriState Capital as well as solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank.\nLiquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2 billion, well above the $1.2 billion target. The Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.8% and the total capital ratio of 21.4% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth. Also, I would note that the Tier 1 leverage ratio includes just 1 month of TriState Capital assets and doesn't yet reflect the assets from SumRidge, which closed on July 1. So the spot Tier 1 leverage ratio following the SumRidge acquisition is below 10%, still well above the 5% regulatory requirement.\nAnd as I said on the last quarter's call, we don't view the client cash we are accommodating on the balance sheet at the broker-dealer and the client interest program which ended the quarter at $13.7 billion, the same as our other balance sheet assets. So we still have ample balance sheet flexibility after adjusting for those excess cash balances on the balance sheet.\nI am very pleased with the progress we have made deploying capital over the past 2 years since we first disclosed our capital targets. Really reinforcing our priority to utilize capital to invest in long-term growth across all of our businesses and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 27.5%, up from 25.4% in the preceding quarter, primarily due to higher nondeductible losses on the corporate-owned life insurance portfolio.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. Following the closing of the TriState acquisition on June 1, we began repurchasing common shares under our Board authorization. We repurchased approximately 1.14 million common shares for $100 million or approximately $88 per share. As of July 27, 2022, approximately $900 million remained available under the Board approved share repurchase authorization.\nAs we explained on prior calls and at Analyst Investor Day in May, our current plan is to offset the share issuance associated with the acquisition of TriState over the next few quarters. And I believe our action in June demonstrates this commitment, but we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we evaluate further repurchases over the coming quarters.\nLastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment. And remember, these metrics reflect our newly formed bank segments, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong and most trends continue to improve. Criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.63% down from 4.07% at June 2021 and 2.63% at March 2022.\nSo now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. As I said at the start of our call, I'm pleased with our results. And while there are many uncertainties, I believe we are well positioned to drive growth across all of our businesses.\nIn the Private Client Group next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected 11% sequential decline of Asset Management and related administrative fees that Paul described earlier. However, focusing more long term, our recruiting pipelines remain strong, and combined with solid retention, I'm optimistic we will continue to deliver industry-leading growth as advisers are6 attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology platform. The segment will also continue to benefit from higher short-term interest rates.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, the M&A pipeline remains robust, but the pace and timing of closings will heavily be influenced on market conditions. Over the long term, I am confident we are well positioned for growth as the significant investments we made over the past 5 years strengthened our platform and increased our team and productive capacity.\nIn the Fixed Income space, we expect SumRidge Partners to enhance our current position in the rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace.\nAnd Asset Management segment, while financial assets under management are starting the fiscal fourth quarter lower due to equity markets, we are confident the strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.\nIn addition, we expect Carillon Tower Advisers with its new addition of Chartwell Investment Partners to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution and operational and marketing synergies.\nAnd the Bank segment is well positioned for rising short-term interest rates as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet prudently. And most importantly, the credit quality of the Bank's segment's loan portfolio remains strong.\nAs always, I want to thank our advisers and all of our for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day.\nWith that, operator, I'm going to open it up for questions. Thank you."

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's Investor Relations website. Now I will turn it over to Kristie Waugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial.

Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to begin on Slide 4. I am very pleased with our results for the fiscal second quarter and the first half of the fiscal year, especially given the challenging market conditions. We continue to invest in growth across all of our businesses. In the private client group, excellent retention and recruiting of financial advisers contributed to best-in-class growth with domestic net new assets of 11% over the 12-month period. Furthermore, the Charles Stanley acquisition, which closed during the quarter, significantly expanded our presence in the U.K., which is a very attractive market for wealth management.\nIn the Capital Markets business, while Investment Banking revenues were negatively impacted by the heightened market volatility during the quarter, we continue to see strong pipelines. As the expertise we have both added organically and through niche acquisitions has been performing extremely well. In the Fixed Income business, we announced the pending acquisition of SumRidge Partners during the quarter, which will enhance our platform with technology-driven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive experience in dealing with corporates. Raymond James Bank grew loans an impressive 7% during the quarter, reflecting attractive growth across all of the loan categories.\nThe TriState Capital acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of our fiscal third quarter, will add a best-in-class third-party securities-based lending capability, while also diversifying our funding sources. They will also bring a diversified asset manager in Chartwell, which will be a great addition to our multi-boutique model in asset management. So as we always do in any market cycle, we continue to invest for the long term, always putting clients first. It's in uncertain market conditions such as these that remind us the importance of focusing on and make decisions for the long term.\nWhile our strategy may not always be popular over short-term periods, today, I believe we are well positioned for the expected increases in short-term rates with record clients' domestic cash suite balances, strong loan growth at Raymond James Bank, high concentration of floating assets and an ample balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios, which are all well in excess of regulatory requirements.\nTurning to results. In the fiscal second quarter, the firm reported net revenues of $2.67 billion and net income of $323 million or earnings per diluted share of $1.52.\nDespite higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting the strong year-over-year growth in PCG assets and fee-based accounts, diluted EPS declined 10% compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to bank loan loss provisions for credit losses during the current quarter to support the strong loan growth compared to a benefit in the prior year quarter. This quarter also had a higher effective tax rate, which Paul Shoukry will explain later on the call. Excluding $11 million of acquisition-related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $331 million or earnings per diluted share of $1.55.\nAnnualized return on equity for the quarter was 15%, and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 17.2%, an impressive result, especially in this very low rate environment and given our strong capital position.\nMoving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with total assets under administration of $1.26 trillion and record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $678 billion. These figures include the assets from the acquisition of Charles Stanley, which was completed on January 21. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, total client assets under administration declined 2.8% and compared to the immediately preceding quarter.\nFinancial assets under management of $194 billion decreased 5% sequentially as net inflows were more than offset by declines in equity markets during the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record 8,730 financial advisers, a net increase of 403 over the prior year period and 266 over the preceding quarter, which includes the 200 Charles Stanley financial advisers. Our focus on supporting advisers and their clients has led us to strong results in terms of adviser retention as well as recruiting experienced advisers to the Raymond James platform throughout our multiple affiliation options.\nOver the trailing 12-month period ending March 31, 2022, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $340 million of trailing 12 production and approximately $53 billion of client assets at their previous firms.\nAnd highlighting our industry-leading growth, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of approximately $106 billion over the 4 quarters ending March 31, 2022, representing approximately 11% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. Second quarter domestic PCG net new asset growth was nearly 9% annualized. Client domestic cash sweep balances grew 4% sequentially to a record $76.5 billion. Raymond James Bank continued to generate impressive loan growth, up 22% year-over-year and 7% during the quarter to a record $27.9 billion.\nThis growth was driven by securities-based loans and residential mortgages, largely to PCG clients as well as strong corporate loan growth.\nNow moving on to the results on Slide 6. The Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $1.92 billion and pretax income of $213 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 17% and pretax income grew 11%, primarily driven by higher assets and fee-based accounts. The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $413 million and pretax income of $87 million. Capital Markets revenues declined 5% over the prior year period primarily driven by lower fixed income brokerage revenue and equity underwriting revenues.\nSequentially, quarterly net revenues decreased 33% driven by lower investment banking revenues, primarily due to the impact of increased geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. As I referenced earlier in March, we announced the acquisition of SumRridge Partners, a technology-driven fixed income market maker, specializing in investment grade and high-yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds and institutional preferred securities. This acquisition is further evidence of our continued commitment to providing cutting-edge technology to advisers, clients and stakeholders.\nWe currently anticipate the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approval. The Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $234 million and pretax income of $103 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 12% and pretax income grew 18% over the fiscal second quarter of 2021, primarily as a result of higher assets under management. Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $197 million and pretax income of $83 million. Net revenue growth was primarily due to higher asset balances as the bank generated attractive growth in its loan portfolio, along with net interest margin expansion.\nDespite revenue growth, pretax income declined 25% compared to a year ago quarter, caused by the bank's loan loss provision for credit losses in the current quarter, reflecting strong loan growth compared to the bank's loan benefit for credit losses in comparative periods.\nLooking to the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $5.45 billion during the first 6 months of fiscal 2022, up 19% over the same period a year ago. Record earnings per diluted share of $3.61 increased 14% compared to the first 6 months of fiscal 2021.\nAdditionally, we generated strong annualized return on equity of 18.1% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 20.6% for the 6-month period.\nMoving to the fiscal year-to-date segment results on Slide 8. The Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments all generated record net revenues and record pretax income during the first 6 months of the fiscal year, again, reinforcing the value of our diverse and complementary businesses. Now for a detailed review of our second quarter financial results. I will turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul. Starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 10. Quarterly net revenues of $2.67 billion grew 13% year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially. Record Asset Management fees grew 25% over the prior year's fiscal second quarter and 6% over the preceding quarter. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts ended the quarter relatively unchanged compared to December 2021. However, adjusting for the acquired assets of Charles Stanley, PCG assets and fee-based accounts declined approximately 3%, creating a headwind for Asset Management revenues in the fiscal third quarter.\nSo I would expect somewhere around a 3% sequential decline in this line item in the upcoming fiscal third quarter. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Skipping ahead to Investment Banking revenues. As Paul described, this line item declined significantly compared to the preceding quarter. But at $235 million, it was still a very strong quarter compared to our results prior to fiscal 2021. Given the heightened market volatility, we would not be surprised to match this quarter's results for the next 2 quarters, which will result in the investment banking revenues ending fiscal 2022, close to the record set in fiscal 2021.\nWhile our pipelines are strong, there's a lot of uncertainty over the next 2 quarters that could impact Investment Banking revenues positively or negatively for the rest of the fiscal year. Other revenues of $27 million were down 47% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to lower revenues from affordable housing investments previously known as Tax Credit Funds. The pipeline for the business is very strong, but the timing of closings is more uncertain given the rapid cost increases impacting affordable housing developers.\nMoving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $76.5 billion, up $3 billion or 4% over the preceding quarter and representing 7% of domestic PCG client assets. Notably, $17 billion or 22% of total cash suite balances are held in the Client Interest Program, the vast majority of which are invested in very short-term treasuries and could be redeployed to generate much higher yields over time, either at our own bank or with third-party banks as interest rates increase and demand for cash balances recover.\nTurning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks was $224 million, up a robust 9% from the preceding quarter. This growth is largely a result of strong asset growth in a higher net interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which increased 9 basis points to 2.01% for the quarter. The increase of the bank's NIM during the quarter was attributable to a higher-yielding asset mix given the strong loan growth as the March interest rate increase really won't start benefiting the bank's NIM until the fiscal third quarter.\nFor example, following the March rate increase, the bank's current spot NIM is around 2.15%. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased to 32 basis points in the quarter, and the spot rate is just over 50 basis points, reflecting the March rate increase. Both the NIM and the average yield from third-party banks are expected to increase further with additional rate increases as less than 25% of the firm's interest-earning assets have fixed rates, and those assets have an average effective duration of less than 4 years.\nIn all of the deposit sweep relationships with third-party banks are floating rate contracts. So we should have significant upside from rising short-term interest rates. To that point, let me walk through how we are positioned to rising short-term interest rates. Based on current clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which decreased by over $2 billion to $74 billion thus far in April, largely due to the quarterly fee billings and income tax payments, using static balances and an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates, which includes the 25 basis point rate increase in March, we would expect incremental pretax income of nearly $600 million per year, with approximately 65% of that reflected as net interest income and 35% reflected as account and service fees.\nThis estimate assumes a blended deposit beta of around 15% for the first 100 basis point increase, commensurate with what we experienced in the less rate cycle. Importantly, this analysis does not incorporate the TriState Capital acquisition, which should provide incremental upside to higher short-term interest rates as the vast majority of their $13 billion of balance sheet assets are also floating rate assets as they have always shared a similar approach to limiting duration risk.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Starting with our largest expense compensation, the compensation ratio for the quarter was 69.3%, which increased from 67.7% in the preceding quarter, but remain below the year ago period compensation ratio of 69.5% and below our 70% target in a low interest rate environment. The sequential increase was mainly the result of lower capital markets revenues, which led to the revenue mix shift towards higher compensable revenues in the PCG segment as adviser payouts particularly to independent advisers who cover their own overhead expenses, are typically higher than the associated compensation of our other businesses.\nOn a sequential basis, the compensation ratio was also impacted by the reset of payroll taxes that occurs in the first calendar quarter of each year as well as annual salary increases and continued hiring to support our growth. Non-compensation expenses of $388 million increased 14% sequentially, predominantly driven by the bank loan provision for credit losses compared to a loan loss release in the preceding quarter as well as higher communication and information processing expenses.\nExcluding the bank loan provision and acquisition-related expenses, which creates some noise in the comparison, non-compensation expenses of $356 million grew 3% over the preceding quarter. Also keep in mind, expenses included just over 2 months of results for Charles Stanley, which closed on January 21. So overall, we have remained focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and noncompensation-related expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients.\nSlide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. In the fiscal second quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 16.2% and an adjusted pretax margin of 16.6%, in line with our 16% target in this low interest rate environment. Based on the expectation for the additional increases in short-term interest rates, we will revisit our pretax margin and compensation ratio targets at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Day scheduled for May 25. Hopefully, by then, we will have more clarity on other important variables such as the outlook for Investment Banking revenues, the level of business development expenses as conferences and travel continue to ramp up and the impact of recently closed and pending acquisitions.\nOn Slide 15, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $73.1 billion a 7% sequential increase, reflecting the addition of approximately $3 billion in assets, mostly segregated client cash balances from Charles Stanley as well as solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank. Liquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, increasing 59% during the quarter, primarily due to significant special dividends from our well-capitalized subsidiaries during the quarter. The total capital ratio of 25% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.1% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter did increase to 25.4%, up from 20.1% in the preceding quarter. The primary drivers of the sequential increase are the favorable impact from share-based compensation that vested in the preceding quarter and nondeductible losses on our corporate-owned life insurance portfolio due to equity markets that are used to fund our nonqualified benefit plans compared to a nontaxable gains on these portfolios in the preceding quarter.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. As of April 27, 2022, $1 billion remains available under the Board approved share repurchase authorization.\nDue to regulatory restrictions, we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing the TriState Capital Holdings acquisition, currently expected to occur by the end of the fiscal third quarter. As we explained on prior calls, our current plan is to offset the share issuances associated with the transaction after closing. But given the heightened market volatility, we'll obviously keep a watchful eye on market conditions between now and then.\nLastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve.\nThe bank loan loss provision of $21 million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.17%, down from 1.5% at March 2021 and essentially unchanged from 1.18% at December 2021. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. As I said at the start of the call, I am pleased with our results. And while there are many uncertainties, I believe we are well positioned to drive growth across all our businesses. In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected 3% sequential decline of asset management and related administrative fees that Paul described earlier. However, focusing more on long term, our recruiting pipelines remain strong. And combined with solid retention, I am optimistic we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology platform.\nFurthermore, the addition of Charles Stanley provides an opportunity to accelerate our growth in the U.K. wealth management market through multiple affiliation options similar to our AdviserChoice offerings in the U.S. and Canada. In the Capital Markets segment, M&A pipeline remains robust, but closings will be heavily influenced by market conditions throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. And while market uncertainty and geopolitical concerns loom in the near future, I am confident we have made significant investments over the past 5 years to strengthen our platform and to grow our team and productive capacity, positioning us well to grow over the long term.\nIn the fixed income space, although depository clients are still flush with cash and searching for yield optimization opportunities, we expect results to be more volatile over the next few quarters given elevated interest rate uncertainty. Additionally, we expect the pending acquisition of SumRridge Partners to enhance our current position in the rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace. In the Asset Management segment, while the financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third quarter lower due to equity markets, we are confident that strong growth of our assets and fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.\nIn addition, upon the close of TriState Capital, we expect Chartwell Investment Partners, which will operate as a subsidiary of Carillon Towers Associates, to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution and operational and market synergies. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet. Raymond James Bank is well positioned for rising short-term rates, and we expect TriState Capital to further enhance this benefit to the firm given their floating rate asset concentration and their leading position in third-party SBL business.\nBefore closing, I want to call your attention to our annual corporate responsibility report that was released during the quarter. The report, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, highlights our foundational commitment to our people, sustainability, community and governance and it illustrates our long-standing approach to doing business, rooted in our values and brought to life through our people-driven culture. This report summarizes many of the inspiring things that our advisers and associates across the firm do to contribute to their communities and the things we do as a firm to help the environment.\nAs always and foremost, I want to thank our advisers and their associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day. With that, operator, please open the line up for questions."

Please note certain statements made during the call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions, including our acquisition of Charles Stanley Group completed on January 21, 2022, and our proposed acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings as well as our level of success in integrating acquired businesses, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or general economic conditions.

During today's call, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedules accompanying our press release and presentation.\nWith that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Although our beloved (inaudible) were slow out of the gate last Sunday, against some very strong competition, not so for Raymond James as we are off to a fantastic start. It's hard to believe the pandemic started in the U.S. nearly 2 years ago. When I think back on all that has been accomplished since then, I'm so proud of the way our associates and advisers have continued to serve their clients with great care and compassion, living out our values each and every day.\nBeginning on Slide 4, our steadfast commitment to serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the quarter. Starting off fiscal 2022 with record quarterly revenues and earnings that were propelled by record investment banking revenues and record asset management and related administrative fees in the Private Client Group. In the fiscal first quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.8 billion and record net income of $446 million or earnings per diluted share of $2.10, a 42% increase over diluted EPS in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.\nExcluding $6 million of acquisition-related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $451 million or earnings per diluted share of $2.12. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.2% and and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 23.7%, a very impressive result, especially in this near 0 rate environment and given our strong capital positions. Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.26 trillion, up 23% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We also achieved record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $678 million, up 8% sequentially. Record clients' domestic cash sweep balances of $73.5 billion and record financial assets under management of $203 billion. Through our client-focused culture and leading technology solutions, we maintain our focus on supporting advisers and their clients. As a result, we continue to see strong results in terms of adviser retention as well as record results in recruiting new advisers to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options. Over the trailing 12-month period ending in December 31, 2021, we recruited financial advisers with nearly $350 million of trailing 12 production and approximately $56 billion of client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels. Additionally, we generated domestic net new assets of approximately $104 billion over the 4 quarters ending in December 31, 2021, representing more than 11% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period.\nFirst quarter domestic PCG net new asset growth was even stronger, generating a nearly 14% annualized rate, the highest level we have experienced that starting to closely track this metric. These results really highlight our industry-leading organic growth. We ended the quarter with 8,464 financial advisers, a net increase of 231 over the prior year period and a net decrease of 18 compared to the preceding quarter. As many of you know, in the last calendar quarter, we generally see an elevated number of retirements and advisers choosing to leave the business and it was no different this year with approximately 90 advisers falling into that category. However, when advisers retire, they typically have succession plans and assets are usually retained by the firm. So there is minimal impact to the production or asset levels.\nClients' domestic cash sweep balances grew 10% sequentially to a record $73.5 billion. As Paul will detail later in the call, we should have significant upside to our pretax earnings in a rising interest rate environment. Also worth noting on this slide is the impressive loan growth at the Raymond James Bank during the quarter, up 5% sequentially to a record $26 billion. This growth was driven by securities-based loans to PCG clients as well as a strong corporate loan growth.\nMoving to the segment results on Slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.84 billion and pretax income of $195 million. Given the timing of certain expenses, we think it is most appropriate to compare the year-over-year results, where the segment's revenues increased 25% and the pretax income increased 39% over the first fiscal quarter of 2021, truly fantastic growth. The Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $614 million and record pretax income of $201 million, representing an impressive 33% pretax margin to net revenues. These record results were driven by record investment banking revenues, including records for both M&A and equity underwriting. Fixed income also generated solid results for the quarter. The Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $236 million and pretax income of $107 million. On a year-over-year basis, the revenues grew 21% and pretax income grew 29% over the first fiscal quarter of 2021, primarily driven by higher assets under management.\nPaul will discuss some of the sequential variances in the segment later on the call. Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $183 million and pretax income of $102 million representing solid sequential and year-over-year growth. Net revenue growth was largely due to higher asset balances as the Bank generated attractive growth in security space lending portfolio, up an astonishing 44% over December of 2020, in addition to the growth in the residential mortgages and corporate loans.\nPretax income growth was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and a bank loan loss release in the current quarter compared to a provision for credit losses in the comparative periods as macroeconomic conditions continue to improve. These record results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.\nBefore I hand the call over to Paul, I'll take a moment to highlight the completion of the acquisition of the U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group earlier this month. Charles Stanley adds approximately $36 billion of client assets, bringing Raymond James total client assets to the U.K. to approximately $57 billion. We have long admired this firm, and we are pleased to welcome Charles Stanley to the Raymond James family.\nAnd now for a more detailed review of our first quarter financial results, I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?\n\nPaul M. Shoukry\n\nCFO, Senior VP of Finance & IR and Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul. I'll begin with consolidated revenues on Slide 8. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.78 billion grew 25% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The Record Asset Management fees grew 1% over the preceding quarter. I do want to touch on the 1% sequential decline of Asset Management Fees in the Asset Management segment during the quarter. Primarily due to a larger portion of certain client fees allocated to the Private Client Group segment, starting at the beginning of the fiscal year, which effectively resulted in nearly $9 million of managed account fees that shifted from the Asset Management segment to the Private Client Group segment during the quarter.\nThis change is the primary driver of the Asset Management segment's revenues and pretax income declining sequentially. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 8% during the first fiscal quarter, providing a nice tailwind for this line item for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. But there are fewer days in the fiscal second quarter, so I expect somewhere around 5% to 6% sequential growth in this line item in the second quarter.\nConsolidated brokerage revenues of $558 million grew 6% over the prior year and 3% sequentially with 12% year-over-year growth in the Private Client Group segment and sequential growth in the Private Client Group segment and the Capital Markets segment. Account and Service Fees of $177 million increased 22% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, largely due to higher mutual fund and annuity services fees as well as Client Account fees in the Private Client Group segment.\nPaul already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter, so I'll touch on other revenues. Other revenues of $51 million were down 31% compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to lower tax credit funds revenues, which are typically highest in the fiscal fourth quarter. Gains on private equity investments also declined on a year-over-year and sequential basis.\nMoving to Slide 9. Client domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $73.5 billion, up 10% over the preceding quarter and representing 6.5% of of domestic PCG client assets. This growth in client cash balances should bode well for us in a rising interest rate environment, which I will describe in more detail on the next slide.\nTurning to Slide 10. Combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks was $205 million, up 3.5% from the preceding quarter. This growth is largely attributable to strong asset growth and a resilient net interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which held flat at 1.92% for the quarter. Average yields on the bank loan portfolio actually increased slightly this quarter, which was fantastic to see. However, an increase in lower-yielding cash balances kept the bank's net interest margin flat. We expect the bank's NIM to remain relatively stable at current interest rates, and we expect a nice tailwind for net interest income going into the next quarter, given the strong growth of loans at Raymond James Bank. But net interest income will also be impacted by fewer days in the fiscal second quarter.\nRelated to loans, based on your feedback, we have added ending period loan balances by category in our supplemental earnings schedule. We hope you find this update helpful. And as always, thank you for your suggestions to continue enhancing our disclosures. The average yield of RJBDP balances with third-party banks took lower to 28 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the low interest rate environment and a limited demand for cash from third-party banks. I want to provide an update to the interest rate sensitivity from what we provided last May during our Analyst and Investor Day.\nAs of December 31, Clients' domestic cash sweep balances were $73.5 billion. Given our high concentration of floating rate assets that are funded with these cash balances, we should have significant upside from increases in short-term interest rates. Using these static balances and an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates, we would expect incremental pretax income of approximately $570 million per year, with approximately 65% of that reflected as net interest income and 35% reflected as account and service fees. This scenario assumes a blended deposit beta of around 15% for the first 100 basis point increase, commensurate with what we experienced in the last rate cycle.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on Slide 11. First, our largest expense compensation. The compensation ratio for the quarter of 67.7% was well below our 70% target and close to the compensation ratio we achieved in fiscal 2021, helped by record investment banking revenues. As explained on our prior calls, while our compensation ratio target is 70% or lower in this near 0 short-term interest rate environment, we have demonstrated we can manage below that target, closer to 67% to 68% and when the capital market segment generates at or near these record levels of revenues. And of course, we'll likely have to revisit this target if interest rates start increasing. Non-compensation expenses of $339 million decreased 6% sequentially, primarily driven by the bank loan loss reserve release this quarter as well as lower professional fees. As you can see in these results, we have been very focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and non-compensation related expenses, while still investing in growth in ensuring very high service levels for advisers and their clients. However, as we discussed last quarter, we expect expenses to increase throughout this fiscal year as we continue investing in people and technology to support our tremendous growth as business development expenses increased with travel and conferences resuming and as net loan growth drives higher associated bank loan loss provisions for credit losses.\nFor example, you can see our communications and information processing expenses increased 13% year-over-year as we continue to make critical investments in technology. We would expect the year-over-year growth for this line item to be right around this level for the full year in fiscal 2022. Slide 12 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. While our pretax margin target in this near 0 short-term interest rate environment is around 16%, we generated a pretax margin of 20.1% in the fiscal first quarter or 20.3% on an adjusted basis, boosted by record revenues, particularly for investment banking, still relatively subdued business development expenses and the loan loss release during the quarter. We will probably have to revisit our pretax margin and compensation ratio targets at our Analyst and Investor Day scheduled in May if we start seeing increases in short-term interest rates. Hopefully, by then, we will also have more clarity on other important variables such as the outlook for investment banking revenues, the level of business development expense as travel and conferences resume more fully and the impact recently closed and pending acquisition.\nOn Slide 13, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $68.5 billion, an 11% sequential increase reflecting solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances that we're accommodating on the balance sheet. Liquidity and capital remain very strong. RGF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, increasing 21% during the quarter. The total capital ratio of 26.9% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.1% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business.\nSlide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. In December, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 31% to $0.34 per share per quarter, which is not reflected on this chart until next quarter. The Board also authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion, which replaced the previous authorization. As of January 25, 2022, all $1 billion remained available under this authorization. Due to regulatory restrictions, following our pending acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing, but we believe this authorization signals our intention to repurchase the associated shares soon after closing. In the meantime, we expect our capital and our share count to continue growing between now and closing.\nLastly, on Slide 15, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Criticized loans declined and nonperforming assets remained low at just 19 basis points. The bank loan loss reserve release of $11 million was primarily driven by improving macroeconomic assumptions used in the CECL models. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans held for investment declined from 1.27% in the preceding quarter to 1.18% at quarter end. For corporate portfolios, these allowances are higher at around 2.13%.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?\n\nPaul Christopher Reilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Raymond James Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2022. We are well positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with strong capital ratios, records for all our key business metrics, including client assets, client domestic cash sweep balances and strong activity level for the financial adviser recruiting and investment banking. In the Private Client Group segment, results will benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with an 8% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts, which would result in a 5% to 6% increase in asset management fees given 2 fewer days in the second quarter.\nAdditionally, based on our robust recruiting pipelines, we hope to continue our recruiting trend as prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology platforms. I can't promise we'll be able to sustain the 11% net new asset growth we achieved over the last 12 months or the phenomenal 14% annualized net new assets we experienced in the fiscal first quarter. But given our strong retention and continued interest in all of our affiliation options, I'm optimistic we will continue delivering leading organic growth numbers.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains very strong for the next quarter or 2 but given all the uncertainties in the market, we really don't have much visibility for the second half of the year at this point. We do know we have a much stronger team than we had 5 years ago, and we have gained market share. So our productive capacity has certainly grown. But what I can't tell you is what will happen to the markets and activity levels across the industry 6 to 12 months from now. We also expect solid fixed income brokerage results over the next quarter or two, driven by demand from depository client segment, which is still flushed with cash and searching for yield optimization opportunities that we do a fantastic job in helping our clients.\nIn the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results will be positively impacted by the higher financial assets under management, which continues to be driven by the strong growth of assets and fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we'll have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet. We will continue to focus on lending to the Private Client Group segment through securities-based loans and mortgages, and we will remain selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan portfolio. Also, as previously mentioned, we should experience significant tailwinds in a rising interest rate environment.\nFinally, I want to thank all our advisers and our associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients. These results are a testament to their hard work and everyone in the Raymond James family.\nWith that, operator, will you please open up the line for questions."

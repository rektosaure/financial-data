The AI era offers massive market opportunities and through the co-optimization of our entire portfolio with AI and accelerated computing, Cadence is uniquely positioned to be the trusted partner to deliver AI-centric transformational solutions across multiple industries. Now I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q2 results and our updated 2025 outlook.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered strong results for the third quarter of 2025 with broad-based momentum across all our businesses. We exceeded our guidance for Q3 revenue, operating margin and EPS and are raising the full year outlook across these key metrics. With the updated outlook and at the midpoint, we now expect our 2025 revenue to grow approximately 14% year-over-year, on track to achieve double-digit growth across all our product categories for the year. Third quarter bookings were strong, resulting in a backlog of $7 billion.\nHere are some of the financial highlights from the third quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1.339 billion. GAAP operating margin was 31.8% and non-GAAP operating margin was 47.6%, and GAAP EPS was $1.05, with non-GAAP EPS, $1.93.\nNext, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash balance at quarter end was $2.753 billion, while the principal value of debt outstanding was [ $2.500 billion ]. Operating cash flow was $311 million. DSOs were 55 days, and we used $200 million to repurchase Cadence shares.\nBefore I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to highlight that it contains the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year. With that in mind, for Q4, we now expect revenue in the range of $1.405 billion to $1.435 billion. GAAP operating margin in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 44.5% to 45.5%. GAAP EPS in the range of $1.17 to $1.23 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.94.\nAs a result, our updated outlook for 2025 is revenue in the range of $5.262 billion and $5.292 billion. GAAP operating margin in the range of 27.9% to 28.9%. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 43.9% to 44.9%. GAAP EPS in the range of $3.80 to $3.86. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $7.02 to $7.08. Operating cash flow in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, and we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares.\nAs usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, I'm pleased with our Q3 results. Following 2025 as we continue to deepen strategic partnerships across the ecosystem. As always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners and our employees for their continued support. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.",

Now I'll turn the call over to Anirudh.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Cadence delivered exceptional financial results for the second quarter of 2025, exceeding our Q2 results. Revenue and EPS guidance driven by ongoing broad-based strength across our AI-driven product portfolio. Bookings were stronger than expected, highlighting the strategic relevance of our AI-driven portfolio and the depth of our customer relationships. Demand for our technologies continues to grow, driven by customers embracing our products at scale, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year to 13% revenue growth and 16% EPS growth for 2025. John will provide more details on both our Q2 results and the updated outlook. We continue executing to our Intelligent System Design strategy initiated in 2018, which remains a clear differentiator in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nOur early investments delivering to our vision of unified EDA, IP, 3D IC, PCB, and system analysis are paying off. These capabilities are enabling us to lead through the accelerating waves of the AI super cycle, from AI infrastructure buildout to physical AI in autonomous systems, to the emerging frontier of sciences AI.\nCustomer.\nR&D investments remain robust, particularly as AI drives exponential design complexity such as in advanced node design and complex system architectures, and this is translating into broad-based demand across our portfolio. Embedding agentic AI into our design platforms across core EDA, system design, and system simulation workflows enables the evolution from traditional tool-based flows to autonomous goal-driven agents. Our Cadence AI portfolio, powered by multiple autonomous silicon agents and built on our unified JEDI platform with NVIDIA Accelerated Compute, is delivering optimized design and massive efficiency gains for our customers. At Cadence Live 2025, we introduced the new Millennium M2000AI supercomputer featuring NVIDIA Blackwell, delivering AI-accelerated simulation at unprecedented speed and scale across engineering and science workloads. This tightly co-optimized hardware-software full system stack delivers up to 80x higher performance and up to 20x lower power versus traditional CPU-based systems.\nMultiple customers provided endorsements including Ascendance, MediaTek, and TreeLine Biosciences. In Q2, we furthered our long-standing partnership with ADI through a broad proliferation of our core EDA software, including AI-driven Cadence, Cerebrus, and Verisium solutions, as well as system software across PCB, advanced packaging, and system analysis. Also in Q2, we deepened our partnership with SK Hynix through a broad expansion of our EDA software, system software, and design IP solutions.\nA major.\nSemiconductor company meaningfully expanded its relationship with Cadence in Q2 through a broad proliferation of our EDA, IP, and SDA portfolio. We furthered our long-standing collaboration with TSMC to accelerate time to silicon for customer designs using 3D IC and advanced node technologies such as TSMC's A16 and N2P through certified design flows, silicon-proven IP, and ongoing technology collaboration. We continued the strong momentum in our IP business, delivering more than 25% year-over-year growth in Q2, driven by product strength and a broadening silicon solutions portfolio. AI and HPC use cases spearheaded the strong demand for our IP offerings, with advanced technologies such as HBM4 and 224G SerDes launching key wins for scale-up and scale-out in the AI infrastructure space.\nWe built on our strategic collaboration with the emerging advanced foundry as they awarded us a large deal in Q2 for our leading HBM4 solution. We introduced the industry's first LPDDR6 memory IP offering up to 50% higher performance to meet the growing memory and capacity needs of AI LLMs and agentic AI workloads. At Cadence Live 2025, we launched the Cadence Tensilica NeuroEdge 130AI coprocessor to accelerate physical AI applications, and in Q2, a market-shaping wireless technology company selected Tensilica HiFi 5S as the standardized audio solution for its music and voice platforms. Our core EDA revenue grew 16% year over year in Q2, further proliferation of our digital full flow at the most advanced nodes continued, and more than 50% of advanced nodes designed using our implementation solutions are now using Cadence Cerebrus.\nIn Q2 we launched Cadence Cerebrus AI Studio, the industry's first agentic AI, multi-block and multi-user SOC design platform. This technology, delivering up to 20% PPA improvement while accelerating chip delivery time by 5 to 10x, was endorsed by Samsung and STMicroelectronics at launch.\nAnd Renesas.\nSuccessfully used our Pegasus physical verification solution to sign off an advanced node SOC after it demonstrated a significant throughput advantage. Our industry-leading Palladium Z3 and Protium X3 platforms accelerated their momentum, delivering outstanding results, with Q2 being the best revenue quarter ever for our hardware systems. Demand for hardware was strong and broad-based, driven by AI, HPC, and automotive customers. Our verification software suite that includes Verisium, Xcelium, and Jasper, and leverages big data and AI to optimize verification workloads, saw continued expansion with 27 new logos in Q2. Building upon 30 years of industry leadership, we launched the Virtuoso Studio 25.1 release, offering broad support for RF, photonics, mixed-signal, and advanced heterogeneous designs. Our leading SpectreX circuit simulator closed several deals with strong growth, while our Fast5 [Spectre] FX platform has now been adopted by the top three memory companies.\nOur system design and analysis business delivered another standout quarter with 35% year-over-year revenue growth. On the packaging front, there was strong customer uptake of our 3D IC technologies, and top foundries and semi customers embraced our AI-driven advanced substrate router, which provides tremendous productivity benefits. Our AI-driven Allegro X PCB design platform saw continued proliferation, as multiple aerospace and defense, hyperscale, and EV customers took advantage of the platform's meaningful productivity and next-generation capabilities. Our Clarity and Celsius solvers saw significant expansion at a major hyperscaler, and Clarity secured a key win at a marquee AI company, while our Reality Data Center digital twin drove strong growth at a top hyperscaler. Beta CAE technology integrations with our CFD, thermal, and electromagnetics products were released, as Beta CAE solutions continued to score key competitive wins, particularly in the automotive segment.\nFinally, I'm pleased to share that we have entered into a settlement with the US Department of Justice and the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security that resolves the previously disclosed incident investigations into certain transactions with customers in China that occurred between 2015 and 2021. The settlement represents a mutually acceptable path forward for all parties, and we believe is in the best interest of our customers, partners, and shareholders. I want to emphasize that Cadence is deeply committed to the highest standards of compliance, and we have significantly enhanced our compliance processes over the last few years and continue to implement improvement measures to proactively address evolving trade restrictions. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and shareholders, and executing the clear strategy we have laid out to drive innovation and enhanced value creation.\nIn summary, I'm delighted with our Q2 results and the continued momentum across our broad, innovative portfolio. The AI-driven era presents tremendous opportunities, and the co-optimization of our comprehensive EDA and SDA portfolio with accelerated computing and Gen AI uniquely positions us to deliver breakthrough solutions across a wide range of markets. Now I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q2 results and our updated 2025 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered excellent results for the second quarter of 2025, with broad-based momentum across all of our businesses. Strength in other regions more than offset the impact of the export restrictions on China outlined in the BIS letter dated 23 May 2025, which was later rescinded. Robust design activity and customer demand, coupled with our strong execution, drove 20% revenue growth and 29% non-GAAP EPS growth year over year for Q2. Here are some of the financial highlights from the second quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1,275,000,000. GAAP operating margin was 19%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 42.8%. GAAP EPS was $0.59, with non-GAAP EPS $1.65. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow.\nCash balance at quarter end was $2,823,000,000, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $378 million DSOs were 51 days, and we used $175 million to repurchase Cadence shares. Before I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to share what's embedded. As Anirudh mentioned, I'm pleased that we've reached a settlement with the DOJ and BIS resolving previously disclosed investigations into certain China sales from 2015 to 2021 totaling approximately $45 million over the six-year period. As part of the agreements, we'll make a payment of approximately $141 million in our third fiscal quarter. Please see our Form 8K, which includes additional details regarding the terms of the agreements. On 4th July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was enacted in the United States.\nThis act includes the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions, including the immediate expensing of United States research and development expenditures. We expect it to decrease Cadence's United States federal tax payments for the remainder of fiscal 2025 by approximately $140 million. Our updated outlook includes the timing of the settlement penalty, the cash tax benefit of the OBBBA, and the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year.\nOur updated outlook for 2025 is revenue in the range of $5.21-5.27 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 43.5% -44.5%, GAAP EPS in the range of $3.97 to 4.07, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $6.85-6.95, operating cash flow in the range of $1.65 to 1.75 billion, and we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares. With that in mind, for Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $1,305,000,000-$1,335,000,000, GAAP operating margin in the range of 32%-33%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 45%-46%, GAAP EPS in the range of $1.14-1.20, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.75-1.81.\nAs usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, I'm pleased with our strong first half results and the robust pipeline for the second half of the year. At the midpoint, we now expect revenue growth of 13% and non-GAAP operating margin of 44% for the year. I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press STAR and then the number one on your telephone keypad. As a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and we'll pause for a moment to compile the Q and A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Joseph Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Baird\n\nGreat.\nThank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on physical AI. It seems like over the past quarter or so, many of your key development partners have had more to say around what they're doing with edge devices or even small language models, maybe as a means to enabling physical AI. Is this factoring into the booking strength you've seen recently? Is it maybe leading to more spend or different spend with Cadence just in terms of the tools that this is going to need versus what the initial build out of AI infrastructure has meant?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Joe, this is a great question. First of all, I'm very pleased by our results, our performance, and the demand of our products, which is broad based. I think there is, first of all, I believe there is overall optimism in the benefits of AI in our customers, you know, both from, you know, what they can, you know, their own products and also how they can use AI internally. Therefore, they are investing more in their innovation. Given the critical nature of our products, investing more in Cadence. Now, it has several aspects to it. You know, I have been a big fan of physical AI for a long time because one unique advantage we have in Cadence is the privilege to work with all the top companies in the world.\nWe believe that of course AI infrastructure is huge, but physical AI has a potential of being even bigger, and then followed that with sciences AI. That's why we have laid this three phase evolution of AI. Now, if you look in the marketplace also with autonomous cars, or robots and drones, it is becoming much more public. Our advantage is even though some of these things come out later, the customers start investing in R&D before they come out in public. I think physical AI will play a very key role for our products because the silicon required, first of all, and physically will affect the whole three layers of that AI cake that I've talked about.\nFirst of all, the silicon is different in the car or in the robot or in the edge devices; it is different than data center silicon. I mean, it's still AI driven, but it's more power optimized, runs on lower battery, as you know. The silicon is different, the simulation and design is different, and of course the AI models themselves are different. They're more world model than LLMs. All these physical AIs still need to be trained. Even if the inference, like for autonomous car, runs on the car, the actual AI model is trained on the data center. The beautiful thing of physical AI is not only it creates new opportunities for us, it also emphasizes the importance of AI infrastructure in the data centers. It is helping both sides of that equation. We are benefiting from that.\nWe are, as you know, working with all the main AI data center players as they design chips and systems. The impact is both on the data center side and the edge side. There's still an evolving market. I think physical AI is still in the early innings. There's still like three to five years of more development to go. Overall, I think what I would like to say is that the customer environment is, I feel personally, better than it was six months ago.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Baird\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. I mean, firstly, congrats on another amazing quarter. Simply, what led to Cadence increase in the growth outlook even though you could not recognize one month of China revenue? I guess, like, the curiosity of whether there was a single stack of renewals across EDA or was this across all fronts. Maybe you can give us more comment on backlog and the development for the year. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Gianni, great question. I mean, yeah, it's been an interesting quarter. China ended up being 9% of our revenue in Q2. That's down from 11% in Q1. We have seen strong demand across all geographies, and strength in other regions more than offsets any near-term softness related to China during Q2. We've spoken in the past about how well diversified our customer base is, and we're increasingly seeing growth. We're seeing growth in bookings from AI, HPC, and system design workloads globally. We're very, very pleased with the way backlog ended up at the end of Q2. It is stronger than we expected going into the quarter, all of the restrictions, and yeah, we're very, very pleased with where we are halfway through the year. Anirudh, anything to add?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nNo, John. That's right. I mean overall, let's say the demand is broad based. You know, you can see it in all the results of all the three main lines of business. I mean hardware is doing phenomenally well. You know, we had a record quarter ever, in terms of revenue, and we have a clearly in hardware. Also, we are essential to all the major AI chips being designed using Palladium and our EDA software, and then all these agentic AI tools like Cerebrus AI Studio. I mean that's a phenomenal new product. Then Verisium, Allegro X. I think both the software and hardware business is doing well in core EDA. IP had a great quarter. I mean there's a lot of reasons behind that. One is the AI infrastructure build out.\nThere are at least four major companies doing advanced node foundries now with TSMC, our long-standing partner Samsung. Even today there's a big announcement from Samsung Foundry, Intel with 18A, 14A, and Rapidus in Japan. I just came back from Japan with this big opening of Rapidus. There are at least four advanced node foundries that all require IP. I think that's also driving strength in IP. System continues to do well because of our focus on 3D IC, which is the fastest growing part of the system market. Beta is providing us a good kind of integration with the rest of the flow and new products like Millennium. If I look at all the three main areas, I think I feel we are very well positioned, and the market seems to be improving with the AI super cycle.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you for taking my question.\nJust a near and a longer term China impact question. On the near term, how much.\nof a headwind was China in Q2? I know, John, you mentioned they went from 11% to 9%. What was kind of the expectation then if we zoom out for all of 2025?\nI think in the past you had.\nSaid China sales were expected to be.\nFlat year on year. Is that still the right approach?\nBecause that would still imply quite a.\nBit of a lift in the back.\nHalf, and then Anirudh, if we look.\nLonger term, what is the right China exposure for Cadence? Does it naturally just come down over time, or will it probably stay at.\nThis 9%, 10%, 11% kind of range.\nOver the longer term?\nThank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Vivek, look, I'll start because I understand your question. I mean, I would view our outlook for China to be optimistic, but prudent. I mean, our guidance reflects what we believe to be a prudent and well-calibrated view of the second half of the year. The export control environment is dynamic, and while we've incorporated current regulatory framework as of today into our assumptions, we always add some prudence to account for potential variability, whether that's geopolitical or operational. You're very, very pleased with how China is doing. I know last quarter we told you that we were expecting it to be flat. It's hard to see how China won't increase a little bit over last year. We've been prudent with our guide.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nVivek, long term, I think China will, of course, invest in chip design and system design, just like all geographies. I think the percentage of revenue should be similar or maybe a little down, not because China won't do well, but because the rest of the world is doing phenomenally well. All the investment you're seeing in U.S., Japan, and Korea, not to say in particular about China, but I think the rest of the world, which we saw in Q2 also, there's significant investment. Given that context, it's difficult to predict exactly what China will do. It's good to see that, you know, China is doing well, but the rest of the world is doing even better.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. You know, if I look at many of the AI, XPU, ASIC, and merchant chip design programs that are in design right now, many of them are looking to transition from 2.5D to 3.5D advanced packaging architectures, which includes chip stacking.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nRight.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nMany of these programs, they're going to start taping out second half of this year, and in some cases your customers are integrating up to like 10 chips in a single package.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nRight.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThis is a very complex undertaking. Integration, floor planning. On top of that, you got signal integrity, thermal, power challenges. Wondering how much is this contributing to the bookings and revenue strength as more of your customers are adopting your Integrity 3D IC or your Allegro X advanced packaging platforms to tackle these challenges of three and a half D packaging. How much is advanced packaging roughly contributing to your overall revenues?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Harlan, that's a great question and great observation. Of course, I mean the whole industry, especially in HPC and AI, is moving to this chiplet-based architecture. I think it's not just limited to the data center. Even, you know, if you look at the latest auto designs and all, all the other markets will, I think, over time move to this new packaging architecture. We are, you know, Cadence is uniquely and very well positioned. I mean, I think we have talked even earlier. Allegro is the platform of choice for package design. 3D IC is another way of talking about package design. At the same time, we have Virtuoso, which is analog, Innovus, which is digital, and then all the system analysis tools like Clarity, Voltus, and Celsius, and that is all incorporated into Integrity.\nWe closely worked with TSMC. You know, TSMC had done a fabulous job, by the way, in 3D IC. We have worked closely with TSMC over the last several years to develop this 3D IC flow that is used by most of their main customers. Now, you know, Rapidus and Samsung and Intel, we're working with all the other foundries to develop this kind of 3D IC flow because it will be critical for all the other foundries. You know, we don't explicitly call out Allegro in our SDA business, but it is a significant part of that business. It also pulls in, you know, the other things. You know, it's not just Allegro by itself, but it naturally pulls in analysis tools, you know, and Clarity and all those things, and even the base tools like Virtuoso and Innovus.\nIt is a platform of choice for all the major companies as they implement this new 3D IC or now 3 1/2D IC technologies.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYou know, this is only in the beginning. I think even in TSMC OIP they showed roadmap that this is only going to increase. I mean, this is the orthogonal access to. I mean, you know, this is orthogonal access to Moore's Law. Moore's Law, first of all, okay, we are always worried about, you know, this is natural questions from investors or employees sometimes, you know, how long will the Moore's Law continue? First of all, Moore's Law anyway is going to go to at least 1 nanometer, right? We are at 3, you know, 2.1, 1.41. Okay. That's 10 years. I visited, you know, some of our research partners like Imec and they're planning, you know, Moore's Law to go till 2042 with new transistor structures. At least for next 10 years I see Moore's Law being strong.\nThis 3D IC and heterogeneous integration provides orthogonal levels of integration. If you look at TSMC and other roadmaps, you know, right, they have very aggressive roadmaps to be able to put more and more chips, like you said, in a package. We are pushing on both of these dimensions. You know, Moore's Law, we want to make sure we are aligned with all the latest technologies and customers. Then this 3D IC and heterogeneous integration.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thank you.\nAnirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Lee Simpson with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks and well done. Another great quarter.\nI think it's false of me too.\nMaybe ask about the Agentic systems. I note again this is the second quarter, you brought it up. It does look as though development's moving ahead, and I think if the comments are to be interpreted right, you are seeing some early sales, one assumes, in sort of pilot line development. I'm still trying to put this into perspective.\nIf we take a step back, do.\nWe need a new business model or a different go to market strategy to get full value here, and more generally, how will you monetize this added value that an Agentic system will bring to the customer? Just any thoughts around that, and maybe timing as well, because it does look as though this is reliant on still early stage reasoning models. Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Lee, that's a good question. I mean, as you know, we package them separate from our base tools. Of course, base tools are phenomenal, but then we have these Agentic workflows on top of our base tools, and customers are embracing both our base tools and the agentic AI flow. I mean, two great examples. One of them I mentioned briefly is in the backend. Cerberus by itself, like I mentioned, is more than 50% of our designs are already using Cerberus, which, let's call it, classical AI. Now, with Cerebrus AI Studio, it's a whole workflow, it's an Agentic AI solution. Instead of just doing block implementation, it does floor planning, it does timing closure. What typically a designer could do, like three to five million instance design, they could do like 30 to 50 million instance.\nIt's a massive productivity and PPA benefit as the AI does more of the manual work that was manual in the past. That tool itself had a lot of early adopters, like we mentioned on the call, Samsung, and ST, and others. There is, on the other side, verification and RTL writing. You know, this whole notion of LLMs generating and reasoning, LLM-generating code, is a big thing not just in software development like C/C++ but also, you know, chip design and RTL. Those two areas are very, very positive. One is in the front end with RTL generation and verification, and the other is in the backend in PPA optimization. Those are different tools than our traditional tool set, and we engage with customers on that.\nOur philosophy always is because we have a long history of innovation and automation in EDA. Our philosophy is to deliver value to customers. Their workload is going up anyway, and aligned with the top customers, and usually they will reward us for that. That's our history over the last 10 years. We are focused on innovation and productivity, and we have all kinds of business models to monetize that in any way. We'll see how that progresses over time.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, that's a very full answer. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks for taking my question.\nI was wondering if you maybe could talk a little bit more about the core EDA results.\nVery strong in the quarter with a lot of growth. Can you maybe cite some of the.\nDrivers of the strength in the quarter.\nBe it new customers or Cerebrus pricing benefits or anything else that was onetime in nature, and maybe give us a.\nSense about how you expect the cadence of the core EDA revenue to trend in the back half of the year.\nCore EDA is doing phenomenally well. I mean, just to remind, I mean I think most of our investors know this already, but just to remind that we have the broadest portfolio in Core EDA. You know, we have digital, which we are leading position in, especially in the TSMC ecosystem, Virtuoso, which is de facto standard in analog mixed signal verification. We have all the verification software tools, and Palladium and Protium in hardware. Cadence has the most comprehensive EDA portfolio on the market. As AI adoption happens, it's both the core product portfolio plus the AI driven agents that we talked about, and we saw signs of that in Q2. Some of the key customer wins we highlighted is of course SK Hynix.\nThey're doing phenomenally well, as you know, with AI and HBM, ADI, which is long term Cadence partner, and then overall strength in hardware, which was very broad based, then in IP and systems, which is outside of EDA. Overall, I think, you know, I'm pleased with that. Of course, as you know, we never focus on, you know, one individual quarter. There could be quarter by quarter variation. Overall, I think EDA is doing well, and I expect it to grow going forward.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Jim, we're getting proliferation at marquee customers, and we're seeing the second half looks particularly strong on the software side as well as hardware on the in core EDA.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jason Sallino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. You know, John, if I think I heard you correctly, I think you said that China would be up a little bit this year versus flat previously. You know, this is on top of, I assume, you know, the China restrictions that were temporary. This in itself seems important. I don't know if you'll be able to indulge this a little bit, but what do you think China growth could have been if those restrictions never happened, like if we never had those six weeks. Thanks.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, yeah, Jason, I mean, great question. Very, very difficult to kind of figure out what revenue would have been in that kind of parallel universe where that never happened. The one thing I take comfort from though is that the restrictions came and they went. I think the focus on the year and when I look at the year that previously we thought the year would be flat for China, with the strength that we've seen across the board, across all businesses, and across all geographies, it's really hard to see China remaining flat year over year now. I think it'll be slightly up. Of course, we're normally very prudent with our guide, and I thought it was appropriate to remain prudent with the outlook for the year. We've been cautious but optimistic with that outlook.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay, great. Sounds good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. John, when we entered the year, I think your expectation, correct me if I'm wrong, was the year with a strong renewal period in the second half. Clearly, your bookings in the first half of the year have exceeded your expectation by, I assume, several hundred million dollars. My questions are two part. I want to confirm that the June quarter ending backlog excludes China, and you know, with the strength in the first half that you've seen, what does that tell you about the potential for the second half bookings and exiting the year with perhaps record levels of backlog?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Gary, I mean, very astute question. To confirm, we had to exclude a number of China bookings from our backlog by the end of Q2. We had to reserve for those because at the end of Q2 the restrictions were still in place for us. The closing backlog at the end of Q2 reflects a lower level of backlog than it would have been had those China restrictions been rescinded prior to 30 June 2024. In terms of the outlook for the year, yes, I'm pretty confident we're going to end up the year with a higher backlog than we started the year. I'm very comfortable that we'll end up with a book to bill of 1/2 half bookings. The renewal cycle is strong in Q3 and Q4. I think both Q3 and Q4 will have bookings that exceed our revenue in those quarters.\nLike I said, we expect that at the end of the year we'll have a new, higher, and record level of backlog than we had last year.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Anirudh, you spoke earlier in answer to an earlier question and in your prepared remarks about Agentic AI. I'd like to ask about the broader implications and requirements from that. One of the terms that's come up this year more broadly in software, not just in EDA, having to do with Agentic is orchestration. In your world specifically, if we think about what you're providing with Agentic AI or AI generally, it's fundamentally, I think, a form of simulation, and therefore the requirements for that would also seem to be new forms of process or data management and traceability, which is a critical function in simulation, if our thesis is right about what you're really doing.\nBeyond just introducing these agents and aids, how are you thinking about the broader portfolio and capabilities that you need to provide customers, particularly since you refer to their workflows? Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Jay, that's a great point. Yes, you're absolutely right. I mean, we want to make more of a workflow automation, just like I mentioned with Cerebrus AI Studio. It's not doing a point function, it is doing multiple functions together with reasoning. The critical need is, apart from the LLMs and all, there's a critical need for a data structure database to store all these actions. What I'm pretty pleased about is the response of our customer to JEDI. You know, we talked about JEDI being our joint enterprise data and AI platform, and it has both the data storage because we need to capture not just one tool or one point in time, but multiple tools and multiple flows, just like a human would do. JEDI has become a very essential part of our AI deployment to customers.\nIt's a very flexible system, you know, because some of our customers, some really big customers, want JEDI to be on prem because their data is very, very sensitive. Some customers are okay with JEDI being on the cloud, okay to use cloud LLMs or cloud data management. Then some customers want a hybrid on prem and cloud solution. JEDI uniquely positions us to make that kind of invisible to the user. JEDI is critical, along with the AI agents, to deliver this solution to our customers. We are able to do much more, and we'll do much more of a full workflow solution along with JEDI and then the agents on top, whether it's Verisium or Cerberus or Allegro X.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nGot it. Thanks, Anirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Kotraba with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on another question on the China impact, I mean, I guess can you help us understand what would have RPO been had the restrictions not been in place exiting the quarter if it had been rescinded prior to exiting the quarter? Just that difference. We know what RPO, I guess, technically really is now. Then just to clarify, on the full year guide increase, is that all driven by the upside from China, or is it other regions as well?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, Joe, just take second part of that question first. I mean, the increase is because of the strength we're seeing across the boards, and across all geographies. I mean, we were doing our updating our guide, the guide we gave you at the end of last quarter was without any China restrictions. At the time we were updating the guide, we obviously knew those restrictions had been rescinded. It is an apples to apples view. When you compare the guide now against this time last quarter, we've taken the year up by $50 million, and we've taken up EPS by about $0.12.\nThat's on the back of very strong bookings, activity, and performance that we're seeing right across the globe in relation to the backlog impact of China. When we held up revenue for China, any of those orders in which revenue was paused as a result of the China restrictions, as of the end of Q2, we had to back out the bookings from the backlog at that time. I think if you look on a year over year basis, the right way to look at it is that we will end up the year with a higher and record level of backlog. The book to bill will be greater than one for the year, which indicates a very strong bookings half for us in the second half of this year.\nThat's mainly due to strength across all regions, across all geographies, and we have a high level of renewal activity that just naturally falls into Q3 and Q4 because we have a number of expiring contracts in those quarters.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Charles Shi with Needham. Your line is open.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham\n\nTaking my question, maybe this is for John. Hey John, I think you reported the recurring revenue as a percentage in Q2 was 78%. This is probably a multi-year low. I wonder what's the expectation for the full year, the recurring revenue percentage, and what is the long-term normalized level? Maybe this is a related question if I may. I believe your hardware is mostly manufactured in the US and presumably there should be no direct tariff impact. Was there any customer behavior related pull inside that was seen in Q2 and possibly also in Q3? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Charles, great questions on the hardware side of the business. I mean, the hardware demand continues to amaze us really. I mean, the tremendous products that we have there, and the team is continuously trying to improve our production capability and manufacturing capability to produce those hardware systems as quickly as possible to try and keep up with that demand. We make hardware systems in North America for the North American market and outside North America for the international market. We think our tariff exposure is quite limited. Just generally, on the strength in hardware in Q2 combined with us having to pause a lot of ratable revenue in China during Q2, it caused the recurring revenue percentage to dip to about 78% for the quarter.\nIf you look, typically we look at that as a kind of a rolling annual number. We'd expect it to be about 80, 20, 80% recurring and 20% upfront. That's been growing. I mean, in the past that was probably 70, what was it, 85, 15, and now it's gone more towards 80, 20. That's really the result of the strength in demand for our upfront businesses, which mainly come out of IP and hardware. Hardware.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham\n\nThank you, I appreciate that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Stifel\n\nYes, thank you for letting me ask a question. Anirudh, I wanted to touch back on IP. I know IP historically has been a little bit lumpy, volatile, whatever the word you want to use, but you've had quite a bit of strength recently. IP was up, I think, 30% last year, 40% last quarter, another 25% this quarter. You talked about your broadening portfolio, but it sounds like a lot of this is going into AI and HPC, and obviously faster design cycles in those markets, et cetera, in recent years. I'm wondering if you could talk about your longer term perspective on IP growth. Is this sort of sustainable at potentially higher rates than you've thought about historically for that segment? Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, that's a great question. In general, I think I am much more optimistic in IP than I was, let's say, two, three years ago. I mean, there are multiple reasons for that. One is we are investing more in IP now because we feel, first of all, that our India position is very, very strong. You know, for years we invested in India, and we continue to do that. At this point, we feel we are in a strong position in EDA, we are in a growing position in SDA, given, you know, 3D IC and, you know, strength of Allegro and AI and IP. Historically, we didn't invest as much, but things have changed. One is because of this, like a previous question, this emergence of chiplet-based architectures, I think, provides more opportunities for IP. Emergence of multiple advanced node foundries.\nThere are at least four major ones now, provides more opportunities for IP. Our portfolio has also improved with some good M and A, like we got HBM4 from Rambus, and there are several others over the last few years. I feel now we have crossed a critical mass for IP to be a good business for us. You're seeing that last year, the one year doesn't make a trend. I think we are seeing that this year. I do expect in the longer term that IP can grow faster than Cadence average, which is what we like to see in these, and it will have slightly lower margin than EDA, but of course it can grow faster. At a rule of 40, you know, that's a good area, and we continue to invest in that.\nEspecially with the AI-driven IPs, new foundries, you know, this onshoring, I think it's a good business for us and good growth for the next several years, I expect.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Stifel\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nClarke Jeffries\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHello. Thank you for taking the question. Just a clarification on the tax benefits. I heard $140 million for the remainder of the year. Just to clarify, is that for two quarters and that the annualized benefit might be close to double that? Just from a philosophy perspective, does this change around R&D expensing sort of change your appetite for incremental investment or near-term windfall, but normalized over time and no change to appetite. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, Clarke. Yeah, I mean, no change at all to our approach, our strategy, and our R&D investment. I mean, we love investing in R&D. We think we do that quite well. In relation to the tax consequences of the OBBBA thingy, the primary change in fiscal 2025 relates to the immediate expensing of domestic R&D. The cash tax impact of that, we get benefit of about $140 million before the end of this year. There's a smaller portion of an impact to the GAAP P&L. Now, from a non-GAAP perspective, we use an effective tax rate of 16.5%. That normalizes everything. The impact of the OBBBA doesn't change our non-GAAP rate for this year. It's still at 16.5%. The one-time difference on cash taxes for the year is about $140 million.\nNow, you'll see the benefit of that in Q4, but it's already incorporated into our annual guide.\n\nClarke Jeffries\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks for sneaking me in, and congrats on a great quarter and a nice raise to the full year outlook. Most of my questions have been answered already, so maybe more of like a medium term thought question. When you look at the guide for the full year, it still kind of implies that the recurring revenue side of the business is going to see muted growth. Now, I know some of this is because, you know, there was a little bit of a hold this quarter because of China, but how do we think, you know, long term the trajectory of recurring revenue growth from here and your confidence in the durability of, you know, total growth as maybe you roll off the hardware cycle or you start to see slower growth on the upfront side. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGreat question. Yeah, I think what we've seen over the last few years is we've seen a drift towards kind of a lower level of recurring revenue, higher level of upfront revenue. That's mainly been as a result of, you know, IP and hardware and SDA to a certain extent growing faster than the average Cadence business. I think right now we're at 80/20. We're not guiding anything. We're at 80/20 for this year. We continue to expect that split, but we're not guiding for next year yet. I actually think that the core EDA software is doing so well that there's quite a good chance that 80/20 remains for quite some time because we're seeing good growth there.\nLike, we're seeing a lot of growth right across the whole portfolio of the Cadence business and across all geographies right now. We're very, very pleased with the way that's working out. Really, the change in recurring revenue is just a slight change in how customers consume our technology and our solutions, and it's how we provide them. We're just delighted with the continuous adoption from those customers.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nLove to hear it. Thanks for sneaking me in, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charles Shi with Berenberg. Your line is open.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham",
    "content2": "Hi. Thank you for taking a question from me, and also congrats on the quarter, the good race, and the four year guide. A question on agentic AI, please. I was wondering if you could maybe share your thoughts on what do you think will be the toughest adoption barriers? Because from my point of view, at least the agentic AI products that you guys have, unlike the broader software AI that we've seen, ROI shouldn't really be a sticky point here. I was wondering what would be the sticking points here. Would it be the operational challenges, i.e., customers adopting or implementing your Agentic Workflows in their established workflows today? Or is it more of a human element here, where unfamiliar with the technology or people are somewhat worried that their jobs may be at risk from adopting your AI solutions. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, very insightful question. I think one thing I would like.\nTo emphasize that there is a difference.\nIn chip design and system design versus general software, you know what I've seen, because this is engineering software versus kind of IT or enterprise software and our history in EDA, I mean, there are a few things that are different. First of all, engineering software or EDA, we have already provided over years a massive level of automation. Now, it was not because of AI, it was used in the past, was because of, you know, classical methods. So our users and customers are already used to a lot of automation. If I look at like 20 years ago to now, I think the EDA productivity, productivity by EDA has gone up by like 100x. You know, like things like, you know, what used to take like 500 people, 5 years to design will now take like 50 people, like 1 year to design or something like that.\nLike half a year to design. Our users are already used to a lot of automation, which may not be the case in classical kind of software. The second thing is that our workload, our workload of our customers is going up exponentially because of Moore's Law and 3D IC. This is a very different environment than, you know, if the workload is constant in some industry that is not evolving. In chip design, you know, like by 2030, the chips will be, you know, right now they're 100 to 200 billion transistors. It's expected the chips will be 1 trillion transistors by 2030. You add all the software, you add the new architectures. The workload will go up by 30 to 40x in the next five years. There's not even enough talent or headcount to hire to meet that requirement of 30x.\nThis is not an industry in which the workload is going to be fixed, okay? The worry of the people is if you use AI, you know, your job will be affected here. You know, you need AI to cope up with the 30x. I believe that the customers, and this is talking to all the big customer CEOs, they will invest in R&D, they will in headcount, but they don't want to invest 30x the headcount. I think the headcount in our customers' R&D will go up maybe by 2.3x, but the remaining gap of 10x in productivity has to be made up with more automation. They are willing to invest in agentic AI and more compute to balance that because there's not even that many engineers you can hire.\nThe two things which are very different in EDA and SDA versus general software. One, our customers are used to more and more automation over the last 30 years. Second, the workload is going up so much that they have no other choice but to use automation and AI. I think that's why the real test for us will not, in my opinion, be whether the customers are willing. I think the customers are willing. It is the productivity of our solution. What I've seen with our customers is if the product works, if they give better PPA, if they're faster, our customers will always adopt that, because they have more and more work to do, and that's what we focus on. Like Cerebrus AI Studio, does it give 20% better PPA, or does Verisium give 5, 10x benefit?\nThis is the history of our customers, and because these are the best, the biggest, the brightest companies in the world, right, we are all max 7 are our customers, all the top 50 companies in the world. We deliver value. I've always seen they will adopt it because the workload that they're doing is increasing a lot.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThe AI tools create more demand for our core EDA tools as well. Right. We always said it would take a couple of contract cycles, and we're always very mindful of the balance between delivering cutting-edge innovation and ensuring our solutions remain accessible, valuable, and useful to customers of all sizes. The increasing design complexity, particularly with AI and advanced nodes, naturally creates demand for more sophisticated tools and IP. Our goal is always to deliver measurable ROI through productivity gains, faster time to market, and the improved PPA, the outcomes that customers can get from using our core EDA. We do think core EDA has growth in there and could well, we could well benefit from that over the next few years.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much. Thank you for the thoughtful answers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat, thanks for taking my question.\nYeah, most of my questions have been answered, just want to follow up.\nTo one of your comments on that, strong bookings. How do you characterize the demand for your traditional semi customer versus systems like hyperscaler, that segment, and do you see any kind of positive sign on the traditional semi customer?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a very important question. I mean, first of all, the system companies are doing more than before, as you would expect. You know, not just the classical data center, but hyperscalers, which are, but also, you know, like physical AI, like cars. And then on the semi side, of course, some customers are doing phenomenally well, right? Like NVIDIA and, you know, some of the other, like Broadcom. I think your question is more traditional semi. I do think, I mean, of course, you know, this recovery in traditional semi has been projected for a long time, but I do think there is some recovery now. I mean, at least in the memory market, there seems to be in the mixed signal. We highlighted, for example, ADI, that's doing phenomenally well, and we had a very good arrangement.\nADI is a long-term partner of Cadence, and we had a very good expansion in Q2. I think there are some signs that the traditional semi are also doing. It's still early, and we'll wait and see. For us, you know, we are, as you know, very diversified both geographically and customer wise. It's important, but not critical for us. We are patient. The recovery will happen in traditional semi. Maybe some of it is starting, and to the extent it happens, we will be ready for it. We are not critically dependent on a particular customer set recovering at a particular time.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt\n\nThanks for squeezing me in, guys, and a great quarter, Anirudh. Just want to ask you again about the system design analysis, the traditional simulation, multiphysics simulation. You're outgrowing the market pretty substantially. Even if we back out a couple extra months from Beta CAE, you're still, you know, mid to high 20s. It looks like organic growth. What's driving that organic growth? Is Millennium helping with that? I'm just wondering, as you look at that market, which is sort of a 10% kind of growth market, how long do you think you can sustain that significant growth?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, good question. I mean, like I mentioned, the growth is driven by multiple things. I mean, 3D IC and the strength in Allegro that pulls in other products is a key factor. It's not just Allegro or 3D IC by itself, but all the analysis tools. Because I think most of the disruption in the system space is either very, very close to the chip, like with 3D IC, or it is very, very far, like data center simulation. We have great partnership and products in Cadence Reality, which is full data center simulation, and then very close to the chip, which is Allegro and 3D IC and Integrity. Those markets, I think, should be growing faster than the overall system market because that's where the disruptions are happening, and that's where we are focused on.\nBeta is helping to pull in some of the other, you know, because we, you know, one of the key challenges in the system side is to build out the channel. Even though not only Beta provided great products, it also helped us on the channel side. Okay, that's the second reason. I'm super optimistic about Millennium, and we are kind of spearheading this kind of revolution. I can talk about it for a long time, the CPU plus GPU integration with partnership with Jensen and NVIDIA and AI together. I think it's still in very early innings. Millennium is still in very, very early innings. I mean, we have a lot of pipeline and demand, but we still have to play out. Overall, I think we'll see.\nWe are pleased with our positioning in systems, especially because we are positioned in the, in the more exciting part of the system market, I believe.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I'd encourage you to keep focused on the kind of, the annual kind of outlook for the company because quarter over quarter numbers can look a bit odd sometimes. As you called out in your question, Beta CAE Systems is included in our Q2 numbers this year, but wasn't there last year.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYep.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThat's great.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt\n\nThat's great. Thanks very much, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence with strong business momentum and growing opportunities with semiconductor and system customers. With a world-class employee base, we continue delivering to our innovation roadmap and working hard to delight our customers, partners, and investors. On behalf of our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's Cadence second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. This concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Anirudh.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered excellent results for Q1 2025, with robust ongoing customer demand for innovative technologies. We exceeded our guidance on all key financial metrics, achieving 23% year-over-year revenue growth and a 34% increase in non-GAAP EPS. Given this outperformance, and the continued strength of our business, we are raising our financial outlook for the year.\nJohn will provide more details in a moment. Before diving in, I would like to share my perspective on the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty. Semiconductors remain foundational to realizing transformative technologies such as hyperscale computing, 5G, and autonomous systems, all fueled by the AI megatrend. We haven't seen any shifts in customer behavior at this time, as they continue investing in their next-generation designs, recognizing that today's R&D efforts are critical to deliver the groundbreaking products of tomorrow.\nAdditionally, our radical software business model, strong Q1 exit backlog, and a predominantly recurring revenue mix provide resilience and excellent visibility. Customers are increasingly relying on our products as we execute our intelligent system design strategy and expand our differentiated end-to-end portfolio to serve a growing and diversified customer base.\nAs the fast-evolving AI landscape expands the market opportunities and reshapes the entire chip and system development process, our Cadence AI portfolio delivers unparalleled PPA, productivity, and time-to-market benefits. At GTC, we announced an expanded partnership with NVIDIA on their latest Grace Blackwell Architecture. In addition to enabling up to an 80x acceleration of Cadence solvers, we are collaborating on developing a full-stack agentic AI solution for engineering and science using the new Llama Nemotron reasoning model.\nWe are also one of the first adopters of NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for AI factory digital twins, advancing data center design and operational efficiency. In Q1, we expanded our footprint at several top-tier customers and furthered our relationship with key ecosystem partners. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Rapidus on 2-nanometer IP development.\nThis quarter, we are pleased to share that Rapidus has made a wide-ranging commitment to our core EDA software portfolio across digital, custom analog, and verification solutions. In Q1, we deepened our partnership with Socionext through a broad expansion of our EDA software, particularly AI-driven digital solutions, along with our system software.\nWe furthered our partnership with the marquee hyperscaler through a broad proliferation of our digital and verification software, particularly our AI-driven Cadence Cerebrus and Verisium solutions. We expanded our collaboration with Intel Foundry by officially joining the Intel Foundry Accelerator Design Services Alliance.\nFrom systems on chip to advanced IP for AI and HPC applications, Cadence's inclusion in the alliance helps Intel Foundry customers remain at the forefront of innovation. Now, let's talk about key product highlights for Q1. Our IP business grew 40% year-over-year in Q1, as we continued to benefit from the strong market opportunities offered by AI, chiplet-based architectures, and the foundry ecosystem build-out.\nWe secured a major expansion at a global marquee system company for our AI/HPC design IP, and deepened our partnership with a major foundry through their commitment to our memory and interface IP. Following our pending acquisition of Secure IC last quarter, we continued to build out our design IP portfolio, and earlier this month, we entered into a definite agreement to acquire Arm's Artisan Foundation IP business.\nA Tensilica DSP is the de facto choice for automotive ADAS and infotainment systems, and continued being widely integrated into vision, radar, lidar, and audio systems for autonomous driving, as well as emerging robotics use cases. Our core EDA revenue grew 16% year-over-year in Q1, with further proliferation of our digital full flow at the most advanced nodes. Cadence Cerebrus AI solution continued its strong momentum with nearly 50 new logos in Q1, and well over 1,000 tape-outs to date.\nEngineering change orders, or ECOs, are a critical part of any design process. AI is particularly suitable to dramatically improve ECOs. Using the new Cadence Conformal AI ECO flows, MediaTek saw early positive results, generating 83% smaller ECO patches in nearly half the runtime. MediaTek also improved runtime and memory by 100x through its deployment of Conformal AI low power.\nOur collection of new smart ECO technologies has sped up Renesas' automated functional ECO runtimes by more than 50% while improving quality. Our flagship Virtuoso platform, the industry's gold standard for advanced node custom analog and mixed-signal design, continued to expand into new areas such as photonics, and circuit and yield optimization.\nEver-increasing complexities in system verification and software bring-up continued to drive secular demand for our market-leading Palladium Z3 and Protium X3 platforms. Demand for hardware was broad-based, with particular strength driven by AI, HPC, and hyperscaler customers. Our hardware products continued to proliferate at existing customers, especially top hyperscalers, while gaining notable competitive wins, including a market-shaping semiconductor company.\nOur verification software suite that includes Verisium, Xcelium, and Jasper leverages big data and AI to optimize verification workloads, and saw continued expansion across aerospace and defense, electronics, and automotive segments. Our system design and analysis business delivered more than 50% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 as our AI-driven optimization solutions, integrated with our physics-based simulation platforms, continued to deliver superior results across multiple end markets.\nOur digital twin Reality data center product gained momentum, signing multiple deals with large hyperscaler and cloud service providers in Q1. BETA CAE delivered a strong quarter and is opening up tremendous opportunities for us in the automotive vertical. Allegro X's Omniverse integration was highlighted at GTC, with photorealistic 3D views of a full multi-board system designed in Allegro X.\nOur AI-driven substrate router, the industry's premier solution for full package routing of complex 3D-IC designs, saw strong customer interest and engagement during the early adopter program. In summary, I'm pleased with our Q1 results and the continued momentum of our business. The growing complexity of chip and system design, coupled with the transformative potential of AI-driven automation, creates significant opportunities for our products to enable and empower our customers.\nIn addition to our strong business results, I'm proud of our high-performance, inclusive culture, and thrilled that Cadence was recently named by Fortune and Great Place to Work yet again as one of the 100 best companies to work for, ranking number 11. Now, I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q1 results and our updated 2025 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered excellent results for the first quarter of 2025 with broad-based strength across all of our businesses. Robust design activity and customer demand drove 23% year-over-year revenue growth and 42% non-GAAP operating margin for Q1, and we are tracking ahead of our original forecast for 2025.\nWe repurchased more Cadence shares than initially planned in Q1, which reduced our share count. Here are some of the financial highlights from the first quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1,242 million. GAAP operating margin was 29.1%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 41.7%. GAAP EPS was $1, with non-GAAP EPS $1.57. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, cash balance at quarter end was $2,778 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $2,500 million.\nOperating cash flow was $487 million. DSOs were 44 days, and we used $350 million to repurchase Cadence shares. Before I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to share the assumption that is embedded. It contains the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year.\nOur updated outlook for 2025 is revenue in the range of $5.15 to 5.23 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 30.25%-31.25, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 43.25%-44.25, GAAP EPS in the range of $4.21 to 4.31, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $6.73 to 6.83, operating cash flow in the range of $1.6 to 1.7 billion, and we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares.\nWith that in mind, for Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1,250 to 1,270 million, GAAP operating margin in the range of 27.5%-28.5, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 41.5%-42.5, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.89 to 0.95, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.55 to 1.61.\nAs usual, we've published a CFO commentary document on our investor relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, Cadence is off to a strong start to the year.\nWe are raising our 2025 revenue and EPS outlook. Our technology platform is essential to customers' R&D investments, and our resilient software model positions us well in navigating today's dynamic macro environment. I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad now. As a courtesy to all participants, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Good to see the strong mid-teens percentage year-over-year growth in the core EDA business. On your channel business in particular, the team did continue to see year-over-year growth acceleration, right, to 13% in the March quarter versus 10% back in the December quarter.\nOn top of this, tariff, trade, regulatory dynamics are, I think, driving more focus on domestic China chip design programs, especially in AI. Like we've heard, for example, ByteDance engaging on new custom AI chip programs. We've heard Alibaba as well in automotive.\nThere continues to be more domestic China design programs firing, both analog, power management, and digital. Is this domestic focus and design activity a potential tailwind for your China business? Are you getting more optimistic on a growth profile for your China business this year versus the team's prior view of flattish?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Harlan, great question. First, I would like to say I'm pretty pleased by our performance in Q1, and the strength is coming in all the various product groups, and also all the various geographies, like you mentioned. The reason is, even in this kind of dynamic macro environment, the customers are investing for the future, and R&D investment takes months to years. As you know, we are tied to the design activity, which is strong. Now, in China, or actually in multiple countries, the AI development is taking multiple cycles.\nI mean, not just, as you know, not just the development of data centers, but I've said for a while now that also the development of physical AI systems, which is autos, robots, and drones. China is particularly strong in that as well. Overall, I think we are pleased with the silicon and system development driven for AI. I'm pleased with the performance of the China business and the start of the year, but we're still prudent assuming China flat for the whole year. John, you want to comment on that?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nNo, I think that's the important point. The design activity remains strong in China, but we're continuing to be prudent with the guide for the year and continue to assume that China revenue is flat year-over-year at the midpoint of that guidance.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nWell, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Lee Simpson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks for fitting me in, and great quarter to everyone. Thanks. I mean, as we all know, your main offering is a software and services product, which may not have the same risk from reciprocal tariffing regimes that other parts of the semiconductor ecosystem does. I think if you look at your hardware chip, it's an ASIC fabbed at TSMC. I guess one assumes this is only limited exposure to tariffing into China.\nI guess what I'm asking more generally is, can you confirm, if at all at this point, where you think you do have any exposure to the tariffing regime announced by the US government, at least as you currently understand things? Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYes, with respect to tariffs, I mean, there are two parts to it. One is the customer behavior, which I mentioned we don't see any change at this time. The second is our own product. Like you said correctly, software and services are not subject to tariffs. In terms of our hardware business, just to remind everyone, we do have multiple manufacturing lines in the US and outside the US, and this was something we did as part of COVID a few years ago.\nThat's paying off well. At this point, we don't believe that, given our diversified supply chain, the tariffs will have an effect on our hardware business as well. Now, on the other hand, we continue to monitor the situation. It's a dynamic situation, but I feel that we are more resilient for multiple reasons. One is that we are tied to the design cycle. We don't see that much change.\nSecond is we are very diversified, both in terms of products and geographies. Third, we have our business model. It's a reliable business model. Even in these uncertain times, we feel that we have enough confidence and visibility to raise our outlook for 2025.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nThanks for taking my question. This question might be more for Anirudh. The question is, as more and more tools that you sell, like simulation, synthesis, place and route, etc., run on generation-based compute and run on GPU-based servers, how does this impact your licensing model? More specifically, how does it potentially affect your annual contract value?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nOkay. That's a good question. I think you mean that as we enrich the hardware that our software runs on, how does it affect our business model? Actually, first of all, I've talked about this three-layer cake for a while, right, with the bottom layer of the cake being accelerated compute. In the old days, we used to run on CPUs, mostly x86 CPUs. Now we run on all kinds of CPUs, including ARM, and then GPUs, especially with our very strong collaboration with NVIDIA.\nFor hardware, we have our own kind of Boolean processor because GPUs are excellent for numerical calculation, like circuit simulation, CFD, or electromagnetics. For zero-one kind of Boolean calculation, we make a special chip in Palladium, right, which is a Boolean supercomputer. As a result, we have a very rich kind of set of offerings on the hardware side.\nNow, on how we go to market, we maintain our previous model in which you can subscribe to the traditional licensing model, which is typically yearly license over a three-year term. We are also offering more and more cloud solutions, okay? There is an uptake in cloud offering. Sometimes the cloud could be on public clouds. The access to CPUs, just like AWS has ARM CPUs and other cloud vendors, and also GPUs.\nWe also have our own cloud offering through outsourced data centers, which are actually seeing good availability. In our own Cadence all cloud, we also are packaging hardware and software together. A good example is Millennium, just like we do with Palladium for our own chips. I think this is a new kind of business model to see how the customers will react. We have the existing business model of software only, and then this cloud SaaS model, especially as the hardware gets more rich in its offering.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tools.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAnirudh, I wanted to check what is Cadence's share gain opportunity because when I look at your main tier, they have double-digit sales exposure at Intel. I'm curious, what is Cadence's exposure? How soon can we start to see any potential share gains? These kinds of relationships tend to be sticky. Just how large is the opportunity, and how soon can it start to show up tangibly for Cadence? Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nThat's a great question. I think your question is on Intel because I missed the beginning part of the question. First of all, I'm very pleased by Lip-Bu's appointment as CEO of Intel. For Cadence, you know for a while, I think Intel has been a, I would say, a weak spot, relatively speaking, for Cadence. This goes back 10, 15 years. It's not a new issue. The other thing has been our investment in IP.\nIn general, I'm pleased with the—so both of these two areas have been the main kind of areas to improve for Cadence: IP and Intel. IP, I think I'm pleased to see improvement last year and also in Q1. I feel good about our IP business in general. On Intel, I mean, this is a great opportunity as they have to, of course, reformulate their strategy and how they work with their ecosystem partners. We look forward to engaging with Intel in a lot more detail. Those discussions have already started, and we'll keep you updated as they progress.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYes, thank you. Congratulations on another great quarter. I guess, could you perhaps share some detail into your hardware deliveries this quarter and whether you're seeing the demand for the third generation in line with what was expected, especially on customers accepting the high pricing in this environment?\nAlso, I know that you've briefly mentioned about it not having any impacts from tariffs, but could you share a few words on your Mexico plans where you assemble your hardware and whether that could be a potential issue from a capacity production standpoint were tariffs being enacted on that front? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nHi, Gianmarco. Great questions. Generally, our hardware revenue is limited by our production capacity because demand continues to outstrip our ability to supply the hardware products. As Anirudh mentioned earlier, we have a very resilient and agile supply chain capability, and that lessens the direct impact of tariffs.\nWe produce and build hardware for the US market in the US and for the international market outside the US. That gives us kind of an optimized setup for hardware. We're not seeing any real direct impact of tariffs on our numbers right now.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAmazing. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nAlso, just to emphasize, we have multiple lines, right? Not just the one you mentioned.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Anirudh, what would you say are the two or three most important technical or product enhancement deliverables this year that may have already occurred or yet to occur this year, even if not with an immediate impact on revenue, but in terms of enhancing your overall technical capabilities or positioning?\nRelated to that, maybe you could talk about some of the investments you're making in some critical technology areas that may not get a lot of attention, one being, for example, physical verification, your physical verification, maybe the next generation silicon for hardware, Gen 4. Lastly, maybe talk about some of the incremental investments you're making in your acquired simulation solver products.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nJay, that's a great question. It's a multi-part answer. Just to highlight a few key things, yeah. I mean, first of all, before I get into specifics, I mean, you know this, but just to emphasize, we have a massive investment in R&D, right? I mean, like 35%-40 of our revenue is going to R&D. At a given point, we always have a lot of exciting projects that are ongoing. Now, in terms of a few themes that are critical, of course, AI is super critical in applying AI to the chip and system design process.\nI think we are seeing a lot of very good results. Actually, one thing on something like Cerebrus or AI-driven design tools, at this point, we expect that the majority of more than 50% of the designs are now AI-enabled. Our tools are AI-enabled in those designs. The others, I'm sure, will catch up as well.\nAI still has a long ways to go with all these new agentic features, and you will see us talk more about it throughout the year. That's the number one thing I would like to highlight. We have these five major platforms, and all kinds of new models can be used in those. The second thing, which is also a pretty broad theme, which makes sure we always stay ahead, is 3D-IC. I mean, 3D-IC is a big theme, another theme for the next 5, 10 years.\nYou can see that in Blackwell. Right now, the packages can handle like three times reticle size, but they could easily go to 10 times reticle size in the next few years. There's massive investment in 3D-IC in terms of the tool flow, in terms of analysis of these complex systems, thermal and electromagnetics, warpage analysis. Of course, IP that is needed for high-speed SerDes and UCI and other things. 3D-IC remains as a critical focus for both our chip business, system business, and IP business.\nLast thing is, I think Gary asked earlier, is this rich hardware set, this bottom layer of the cake with Arm CPUs, x86 CPUs, Palladium hardware, and GPUs. We'll have some more developments next week at Cadence Live about that part. This hardware-software co-optimization, I think, is going to be critical for our industry. Those are the three things I would highlight as top critical R&D focus areas.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nOkay. Thanks, Anirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Celino\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you. Keeping to this IP topic, I think you've planned to acquire Arm's Artisan IP asset. I know this hasn't closed yet, but when we think about the foundational IP market, just curious, why hasn't this been a bigger focus in the past? What's changed to make this opportunity more attractive? Just to clarify with John, this pending acquisition is not included in guidance. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, let me take the second part first, Jason, just to clarify that, yeah, it's not in our current guide. It's not closed yet, so we haven't put that into the guide. I'm actually pleased with this partnership and acquisition. Arm's foundation IP business has a very rich history, as you may know. It started with Artisan a long time ago and has very good credibility in the market.\nAs our IP position improves with our kind of performance over the last two years, we also have to expand our portfolio. I'm pleased with the performance and PPA of the current portfolio, but we have to fill in the gaps in our portfolio. That's the reason we, for example, acquired Rambus's IP business and then acquired Secure IC a few months ago. This is a critical piece, foundation IP, and it is becoming more and more critical versus five, seven years ago.\nFoundation IP became a lot more critical, especially in the interaction with the software, with place and route. Also, there is a massive, as you know, foundry build-out. There are multiple foundries in multiple countries, and they all require foundation IP. That's the other reason I feel that foundation IP is much more critical now.\nIt's a combination of foundation IP being more critical, a need to broaden our IP portfolio, work with our software tools. This opportunity came along to acquire a leading product in that space because we didn't want to enter the space with not a good product. Arm's Artisan business has a good history, great product. We hope to finish that acquisition later in the year and talk to our customers about that.\n\nJason Celino\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Quattrocchi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Quattrocchi\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you were developing a full-stack agentic AI solution. I was wondering if you could talk about just the areas of the design workflow you're targeting first with that.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nOh, great question. I mean, it could be applied to almost all the design process, but some that are super critical in terms of need. Of course, verification is always critical because verification, of course, we have great products with both hardware and software, but you never know when you're done with verification. It's like an NP-complete problem. If you look at now our SIM AI offering, which works with a logic simulator, it can improve performance by 5x to 20x.\nWe have all these several customer endorsements, public customer endorsements for applying SIM AI to verification. I think verification, to me, is a great area for agentic AI. Implementation is always a good area. Things like Cerebrus can be further enhanced, and you will see more and more developments from us on digital design and agentic AI pretty soon. I would say that's the second area.\nOne area that traditionally has not seen that much automation but is becoming more and more critical is package and PCB design, Allegro, Allegro X, and Allegro X AI. Actually, I'm very optimistic that as package design becomes super critical, and package is the critical thing in a 3DIC system. 3DIC is another name for system in a package.\nThere is a more need for automation in packaging and automation in PCB design. I'm actually pretty optimistic that AI can finally provide automation in packaging. I would say analog migration, another big area. Analog is like art plus science, but AI can also help in analog. I think these are the three or four key areas that we will work on. The scope of agentic AI is throughout the product spectrum.\n\nJoe Quattrocchi\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you. This might be an overly simplistic question relative to those before me, but your commentary and guidance raised strikes me as having greater visibility into strength during the second half of this year than maybe what's apparent just in our seat when analyzing the size of the one cube beats or even your quarter-end backlog value. Can you maybe just speak to some of the things that change for the better in the last 60 to 90 days that make you feel better about the 2025 outlook?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes. Joe, yeah, I'll take that one. Yeah. I mean, we're tracking ahead of our original forecast for 2025 with solid Q1 results. We only gave you the guide a few weeks ago for the year. Not a huge amount has changed. I think we have had a bit more strength in our recurring revenue. Of course, as you know, recurring revenue, any beat in recurring revenue feeds through the rest of the year.\nA small beat in Q1 kind of follows through in Q2, Q3, and Q4. We were, like I say, ahead of the original forecast, even with including building in an expectation that we'll pick up some slightly higher expenses on the tariff side. We're still resilient on the tariff side. We felt it was right to raise the guide.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Can you hear me?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Loud and clear, Josh.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you for sneaking me in. I always love it when the guy before you kind of steals your question. I guess just to put a finer point on things, I think, Anirudh, you mentioned that the guidance still assumes that China is flat for the year. You guys are being prudent.\nI guess my question to that is, I understand there was an easier comp in Q1, but year to date, are you guys seeing anything that suggests that China should actually grow flat for the year? I guess another way of saying it is, is the decision to keep China flat for the year in the guide prudence or more along the lines of your expectations of how things will shake out by the end of the year? Thanks.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Josh, I'll take that one as well. I think it's more prudence that we thought it's wise to remain prudent in the current macro environment. I think we're very resilient in this environment. I mean, a company with high gross margin and essential products should do well in this type of environment. The bookings were really solid in Q1. We had stronger bookings than expected, kind of fed into with more recurring revenue bookings as well. That fell into us tracking ahead of the original forecast for 2025. We thought the right thing to do was raise the guide.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nSuper helpful, guys. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey. Thanks for taking my question. Anirudh, if you see there are a lot of news going around, we saw DeepSeek early this year, wondering how that's impacting the design velocity or even how you see the compute capacity will change. At the same time, also, we are seeing hyperscaler trying to purge their data center build-out. Are you seeing any kind of impact there? Would love to hear your views on this.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Siti, that's a great question. I mean, that's a big question. Let me try to, I mean, it's a critical thing for the whole industry. First of all, when I talk to customers, DeepSeek is one advancement. A lot of customers expect multiple advancements like this. AI will get more and more efficient as, and this happened if you look at even EDA's history, right? When AI started off, it was more like dense computation. If you look at EDA history in the 1970s, we started off with dense computation.\nThen we have sparse computation, we have partitioning, we have hierarchy, we have latency. There are all kinds of computer science methods that will be applied to AI. Okay. I believe that there will be multiple DeepSeek moments, not just one DeepSeek moment. At the same time, AI will get more and more prevalent in its use. Okay. This happened in CPUs. I expect the same thing will happen with AI and GPUs.\nIn terms of when we talk to customers, first, I have to remind you that we are on the design side, not on the production side. In terms of design, we only see acceleration of more and more designs to do AI, even on the data center side. Of course, NVIDIA is a great partner of ours, and I think NVIDIA is doing exceptionally well. Also, a lot of the other hyperscalers, all the four or five major US hyperscalers, and then companies in other countries are also investing heavily in their own designs.\nWe are glad to work with them. Like I mentioned before, the physical AI part of it, which is cars, planes, and drones, is also there's a lot of design activity now. Even though the car market may not be as strong, that's for current products. They are designing for future products, which will be AI-enabled. The other thing, as AI gets more efficient, I think there will be more inference use. There's a lot of design of inference chips to support that.\nRight now, in terms of design activity, I feel pretty good. Like I was mentioning before, even on the data center side, the 3D-IC is going to cause a massive change in complexity. Right now, we have Blackwell with two kind of big dies with HBM. The packaging roadmap is very aggressive by all foundries.\nI think that is also going to drive new and new AI designs with putting more kind of big chips in packages. That should also drive AI performance and efficiency. Right now, we do not see any big change in terms of the design activity for AI.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nOkay. Thanks for that color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Nay Soe Naing with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\n\nNay Soe Naing\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Berenberg\n\nHi. Thank you for giving me a question. Mine is on your SD&A segment, please. Another very impressive quarter in Q1. I was just trying to understand if you could maybe share where the strength is coming from, especially when we put it against the product market and your peers as well. In the last three years, you have been growing at 2x to 3x. What have your competitors been able to do?\nI was wondering if there were any competitive market wins that's driving your performance. If not, what are the reasons, please? Maybe if I could squeeze in a second part of this question, the solid performance we've had in the past, does it, any chance at all, create any headwinds for you or tough comps for you going forward? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks for the question. You're right to raise the comps because I think one of the benefits for Q1 is that Q1 2024 was a pretty easy comp for us on the SD&A side. I mean, Beta performed well in Q1 2025, but we only acquired that in the middle of the year last year. I think the first time Beta turned up in our results was Q3 2024. Beta is providing a huge amount of pull-through business for Cadence.\nCadence products are being sold alongside Beta products, and that's really helping us for growth. We're expanding reach to the longer-tail customers through our e-commerce model. We've seen strength in automotive, air, and defense. I don't know, Anirudh, do you want to add anything about Beta?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nWell, Beta is performing great, and also, it has a pull-through to other parts of our portfolio. One thing we are always confident, and I think you've seen some benchmarks in the industry in the past, that our R&D products are solid. They are rewritten, they have no accuracy loss, and they have much better performance because of massive parallelism, whether it is on CPUs or GPUs. We are always confident on our product side, and we continue to innovate there.\nI think what Beta helps is to increase the reach of those products because they are working with all the auto companies. Not only can we benefit from the performance of Beta, but we also can sell our other products to those customers. We also improved our cloud offering and go-to-market with indirect channel. I think you're seeing some benefits of that, better go-to-market operation on the system side.\n\nNay Soe Naing\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Berenberg\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nThank you for letting me ask the question. Anirudh, I had a similar question to Jason's on IP. You touched on this in your answer to that question, but just wanted to make sure I understood in terms of sort of these, I would say, accelerated pace of recent tuck-ins on the IP side.\nSounds like they're opportunistic rather than customer-driven. Wanted to make sure I got that right. The second part of the question is just maybe if you can update sort of how you're thinking about IP in terms of longer-term growth from that segment, given all that's going on with foundry and customers, etc. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYes. Great question. I think in terms of IP, there are multiple factors. One is our performance is better. The portfolio we had, especially the PPA, Power Performance in the Area for TSMC, the most advanced foundry, the IP is just much better quality and performance. That's driving customer demand. The customers want us to get IP from us and want us to have a bigger portfolio. Okay.\nAs a result, we do, of course, invest organically, and we will do in-organic acquisition if we see a good fit. Okay. It's both a combination of what is available, but the customers are definitely driving us to broaden our portfolio. That's one. Second thing is there's more and more foundries. We are glad with our partnership with TSMC, but we highlighted even this time, like Rapidus is making massive investments. Of course, Samsung and Intel, and we are glad to.\nThere are at least four major foundries at advanced node, along with all the foundries like Global and UMC at more mainstream nodes. I think the foundry ecosystem is rich, and that provides more opportunities in IP. The third thing, of course, is AI and 3D-IC and all this in die-to-die IP. For all these three reasons, I'm optimistic.\nWe are performing well. We are increasing our portfolio. The market wants more IP from us. I expect IP to, of course, we had a good year last year. We had a very good quarter, Q1. I expect IP to grow better than Cadence average going forward.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThanks for squeezing me in, guys. Nice quarter. Anirudh, just wondering if you could give us sort of high-level thoughts on the data center digital twins. You bought Future Facilities back in July 2022. It seems to be getting some traction out there. I just want to see how you feel about the size of the TAM, the size of the opportunity there with that asset, and are there expansion opportunities beyond data centers?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nAbsolutely. The two areas that I have been very excited about, especially on the system side, one is which is very close to the package, like I mentioned, thermal, electromagnetics, warpage, because there's a massive transformation right next to the chip. We are in a very strong position with Allegro and all the analysis tools. The second area is all the way at the data center level. That's why we acquired Future Facilities.\nActually, it had a very strong Q1. We also have a great partnership with NVIDIA there. NVIDIA is designing their data centers with our Cadence Reality digital twin, and also working with joint partners as we go to market with them together on Cadence Reality. That opportunity is huge. I mean, even we applied it to our own IT group, for example. We have our own data centers, right?\nThe product is general enough to be used in any data center. We saw a 10% improvement in power, which is huge, because typically, that's the area that has not seen a lot of analysis and automation, since it's usually done in a typical construction kind of work, whereas chip design is very analytical, mathematical. That area needs more kind of optimization and simulation. I am optimistic.\nThe way Cadence Reality works, there is a design side of it in which we help customers design the data center, and then there's the operation side of it in which we can analyze on the fly, use the digital twin to optimize their operation. If you include both sides, I mean, the opportunity is huge. We are still kind of prudent in our assumptions, like we do in everything. I'm very optimistic about these two extremes. One is all the way to data center, and second is all the way very close to the chip on the package. That's where you see us investing.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nYeah. Great. Thanks very much for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence as a broad portfolio and product leadership ideally positions us to maximize the growing opportunities in the semiconductor and system industry. On behalf of our employees and our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for your continued trust and confidence in Cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence First Quarter 2025 earnings conference call. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.",

I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered exceptional results in Q4, capping off a strong 2024 with 13.5% revenue growth and 42.5% non-GAAP operating margin for the year. We exited 2024 with a record backlog of $6.8 billion US dollars, which is a testament to our compelling AI-driven chip-to-systems portfolio, and its growing proliferation among marquee system and semi customers. The AI supercycle is entering a new phase with Generative AI, Agentic AI, and Physical AI, fueling an explosion in compute demand and semiconductor innovation. We see AI adoption unfolding in multiple phases, starting with the build-out of the AI infrastructure, where we are already deeply engaged. At the same time, we are actively integrating AI into our own products, and we are also exploring AI potential to create new markets.\nThe Infrastructure AI phase is well underway, and we have been closely collaborating with market leaders on their next-generation AI designs across both training and inferencing. In Q4, we advanced our longstanding partnership with NVIDIA through commitments across a range of our EDA, hardware, IP, and system software solutions. We are also using NVIDIA's latest NeMo and NIM microservices to build customized GenAI applications, delivering enhanced optimization and productivity. We deepened our collaboration with Qualcomm through a significant expansion of our EDA and system software solutions. We meaningfully expanded our strategic partnership with Marvell through a broad proliferation of our portfolio of products. Our Cadence AI portfolio continued gaining strong momentum with market-shaping customers. Our AI-powered products, such as Cadence Cerebrus, SimAI, and Allegro X AI, are proliferating at scale, and our LLM-based design agents powered by JedAI Data Platform are showing promising results in early engagement.\nCadence Cerebrus is rapidly becoming an essential part of the design flow as it continues to deliver transformative PPA benefits to customers, with more than 750 tapeouts to date and over 300 in Q4 alone. Our Verisium AI-driven verification platform, with its SimAI and DebugAI apps, gains share at key competitive accounts as customers embrace the significant boost in verification quality and efficiency. Additionally, we are also applying AI to new market opportunities, such as life sciences, with our OpenEye drug discovery software. The growing foundry ecosystem is driving increased design activity and creating significant opportunities for our products. In 2024, we strengthened our collaboration with existing foundry partners and entered into new strategic engagements. We further our partnership with TSMC, with AI-optimized design flows certified for TSMC's N3 and N2P technologies. We strengthened our collaboration with GlobalFoundries and are partnering with Samsung on their SF2 Cadence all-around process.\nWe also partnered with Intel Foundry to provide design software and leading IP solutions at multiple Intel advanced nodes, and in Q4, entered into a strategic collaboration with Rapidus for 2nm enablement technology. We deepened our partnership with ARM through a broad expansion of our IP hardware and AI-driven design enablement solutions, and in Q4, successfully taped out industry's first ARM CSA standard-based system chiplet. Now, let's talk about some of the specific product-level highlights for Q4 and 2024. Our system design and analysis business delivered strong results, achieving over 40% growth in 2024. Our multiphysics analysis platform, with AI-driven optimization, is delivering superior results to a rapidly expanding customer base across multiple verticals, especially aerospace and defense, and automotive. Our Millennium CFD simulation platform ramped up over the year, closing two meaningful deals in Q4 in the aerospace and defense and energy verticals.\nWith Beta CAE, we now provide a comprehensive multiphysics platform covering electromagnetics, electrothermal, CFD, and structural analysis. Beta CAE performed ahead of our expectations, with major expansion at several marquee automakers, including at some of the fastest-growing EV companies. Our Allegro X design platform, with its significant productivity and next-generation capabilities, continued its momentum, especially at aerospace, defense, hyperscale, and EV customers. Allegro X AI, the industry's first fully automated PCB design engine, is enabling customers to realize up to a 10x productivity gain. Our Integrity 3D-IC platform, with its unified design, analysis, and sign-off capabilities for multi-chiplet architectures, expanded its footprint at hyperscale and memory customers, OSATs, and foundries. Our IP business drove a strong finish to the year, growing 28% year-over-year in Q4. Our AI HPC protocols, including our flagship HBM, DDR, PCIe, and UCIe solutions, propelled our business, with significant expansions and competitive displacement at top-tier customers.\nWe continue to broaden our IP portfolio with high-growth star IP products, and last month, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Secure-IC. The addition of their embedded security IP products will augment our rapidly expanding portfolio of leading-edge silicon-proven IP, including interface, memory, AI, and DSP solutions. We announced a collaboration with Rapidus to provide a broad set of our advanced memory interface IP for their 2nm backside power process node. AST SpaceMobile committed to our AI-driven IP solutions and EDA tools on their AST5000 ASIC, a custom low-power architecture for global space-based cellular broadband services. Our core EDA business, comprising our digital, custom analog, and verification portfolios, grew 15% year-over-year in Q4. Insatiable demand for more compute, along with system complexity and the need for first-time-right silicon, continued to drive strong demand for our best-in-class Palladium Z3 and Protium X3 systems.\nOur hardware family delivered yet another record year, adding over 30 new customers and almost 200 repeat customers in 2024, with particularly strong demand from AI and hyperscale customers. Our digital portfolio had another strong year, gaining 36 new full-flow customers in 2024, including 17 in Q4. Cadence partnered with Equal1 on the development of its Alpha5 Quantum SoC that runs at cryogenic temperatures, with our design and implementation tools being central to this revolutionary design. Our Virtuoso Inspector franchise solutions tackle the most complex design and simulation challenges in analog, mixed-signal, and RF design. Virtuoso Studio, delivering industry-leading AI-powered layout automation and optimization, continued its strong ramp, and is now deployed at over 450 customers. MediaTek adopted Spectre X, running on NVIDIA's Hopper GPUs for its 2nm designs, achieving up to a 6x performance boost while maintaining full accuracy.\nSpectre FX FastSPICE is now in production usage at more than 75 customers, including top memory vendors, as well as SoC and mixed-signal companies. In closing, I'm pleased with our outstanding performance in 2024, and excited about the business momentum and opportunities ahead. As the AI era continues to unfold, our AI-driven EDA, SDA, and IP portfolio, powered by GenAI agents and accelerated computing, is delivering transformative results, uniquely positioning us to capitalize on these massive opportunities. Now, I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q4 results and our 2025 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered an outstanding Q4 and 2024, with broad-based strength across all of our businesses. Robust design activity and customer demand, combined with our strong execution, drove 13.5% revenue growth and 42.5% non-GAAP operating margin for the year.\nFourth-quarter bookings were exceptionally strong, and we entered the year with a record backlog of $6.8 billion US dollars and a record CRPO of $3.4 billion US dollars. Here are some of the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1,356 million US dollars for the quarter and $4,641 million US dollars for the year. GAAP operating margin was 33.7% for the quarter and 29.1% for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 46% for the quarter and 42.5% for the year. GAAP EPS was $1.24 US dollars for the quarter and $3.85 US dollars for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.88 US dollars for the quarter and $5.97 US dollars for the year. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, our cash balance was $2,644 million US dollars at year-end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $2,500 million US dollars.\nOperating cash flow was $441 million US dollars in the Q4 and $1,261 million US dollars for the full year. DSOs were 48 days, and we used $550 million US dollars to repurchase Cadence shares during the year. Before I provide our outlook for 2025, I'd like to share some assumptions that are embedded. Our outlook is based on our usual assumption that export control regulations in place today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year. At the midpoint of revenue guidance, we are assuming 2025 China revenue will be flat year-over-year, and our non-GAAP EPS outlook continues to be based on a tax rate of 16.5%.\nIn our outlook for 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $5.14 to 5.22 billion US dollars, GAAP operating margin in the range of 30.3% to 31.3%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 43.25% to 44.25%, GAAP EPS in the range of $4.19 to 4.29 US dollars, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $6.65 to 6.75 US dollars, operating cash flow in the range of $1.6 to 1.7 billion US dollars, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2025. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.23 to 1.25 billion US dollars, GAAP operating margin in the range of 27% to 28%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 40% to 41%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.93 to 0.99 US dollars, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.46 to 1.52 US dollars.\nAs usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our investor relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, I'm pleased that we finished the year with record backlog and CRPO. We are starting 2025 with a very strong outlook for non-GAAP incremental margin. As always, I'd like to thank our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, Operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and we will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. You know, when we look at the backlog number, you know, the 1,200 or the $1.2 billion US dollars of sequential improvement, that's like the biggest we've ever seen, much higher than kind of what I think some of us were expecting. When we look at the guide for the full year, the 11.5% starting point is a little lower than where you've started other years in the past. Maybe, John, can you help us just reconcile the confidence in the backlog and kind of how you're approaching guidance for 2025? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, sure, Jason. Thanks for the opportunity to clarify. Yeah, we're very pleased with the strength and momentum that we carried into year-end and into this year.\nWe did allude to it on a call last time, and we thought the pipeline looked extremely strong, and we just wanted the team to focus on converting that. We saw broad-based strength across all of the businesses on backlog, on bookings for Q4. It was a strong renewal quarter, Q4. In contrast, I mean, when I look at this year, second half is probably stronger for renewals than the first half, so we'll probably burn some of that backlog in the first half of the year, but it'll come back in Q3 and Q4. The duration, our backlog duration is normally somewhere in the region of 2.4 to 2.6 years every year, and we ended up at the high end of that range for this year. When I look at the year in total for 2024, we were super pleased with the strength ex-China.\nThe growth outside of China was high teens. China, of course, declined just over $100 million US dollars in dollar terms from 2023 to 2024. We did backtest that. I think I mentioned that on the last call as well. We went back to 1999 and looked at the last 25 years of performance in China in dollar terms. There were only three years where we had down years, and 2024 was the third time we experienced a down year in dollar terms in China. We've never had two consecutive down years in China, and we thought it would be prudent to assume in the guide for 2025 that China was flat because it's notoriously hard to predict, and I want to manage an expense plan based on a prudent guide.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Quatrochi\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on that note on the China piece. One, was there any change in the RPO balance from the export restrictions? Then two, I guess on that flat kind of expectation for 2025, should we assume that the hardware cycle specifically in China is maybe more of a 2026 driver then?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nOh, yeah, good question. I mean, basically, I was just trying to be prudent with the guide and make sure that we were managing expenses very effectively for 2025. I mean, when I look at the booking activity for Q4, it was quite strong. I think we're seeing strong design activity in China. Anirudh, do you want to comment on any of that?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, you know, actually, it's good to see design activity across the board and in all verticals. Now, talking specifically about China, actually, I was there in November, and it's good to see design activity picking up, right? I think even our China results in 2024 improved through the year from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and Q4. China, especially, as you know, there's a lot of design activity in, for example, in automotive, where at least five or six major auto companies are driving the EV revolution, and almost all of them are designing chips now.\nWe have the privilege of working with all the major auto companies there. Also, with our new systems portfolio, especially including Beta, not only are we engaged with them on the chip design side, but also on the packaging, board, and system side. Overall, I do think that the China activity is strong, like it is strong in a lot of other regions.\nI think in terms of the guide, it's just best to be prudent and then see how it goes. Given all this macro uncertainty, we thought it's better to be prudent on the guide, but the design activity seems to be actually picking up, and we'll see. It's difficult to predict how that goes through the year, but so far, so good.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Joe, you mentioned the specific metrics in terms of CRPO. There's no real material impact on any of that from what we're seeing in China. You're right to call it hardware, though. I mean, we had a strong hardware year in 2023 in China, and it was kind of weaker in 2024. That's why the year is down year-over-year in China. I just didn't want to be predicting what would happen for 2025. It's just very, very difficult for us to predict what happens in China for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nJohn, hate to waste my one question on another follow-up on China, but I am getting this question from investors just around the entity list, wondering if there had been any changes. It seemed like there were additions to the entity list going into the end of the year. Is that informing your prudent view on China, or is it really just coming off of that down year and assessing renewals and timing of hardware ramp? Has something changed, I guess, is the question around that detail list? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, thanks, Ruben. No, I think I would put it down to general prudence. There's nothing really changed in China, but we did see we had a down year, our third down year in 2025, in 25 years. We just thought it would be prudent to assume flat, and that would de-risk the guide for everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. I'm trying to get a better handle on what's the right interpretation of the recurring revenue growth that is slowing down. I assume, obviously, China is one aspect of it. If I were to just take the 2024 recurring revenue rate and then look at, I think you're guiding 80% recurring revenue, that does suggest a bit of a deceleration. Why is that? When the market for AI and all these other products is improving so much, why is the recurring revenue sales for decelerating so much?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nHi, Vivek. Yeah, thanks for the question. Yeah, when we look at recurring revenue growth, of course, the assumption that we have in for China being flat is a headwind for that recurring revenue growth because if we look at the impact of China decelerating by like $100 million US dollars from 2023 to 2024, the vast majority of that was in core EDA and mainly on the hardware side. We're seeing that impact the recurring revenue numbers.\nOf course, the recurring revenue is the expected mix for this year is expected to go to 80% recurring, 20% upfront, but that's more a reflection of the strength that we're seeing in our upfront revenue businesses. They're growing faster than the average Cadence business. Anirudh, do you want to talk to any of that?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, of course, I think we're good to see strength across the board, especially hardware and IP is performing really well in 2024, and I expect that they will do well in 2025. There are multiple reasons driving that, which we can get into, but we have a phenomenal product in hardware. We're well ahead of what the customers will need for several years. In terms of all our kind of engagements with the customers, they're very pleased with our hardware system. We had a record 2024. Also, we had strong demand hardware going forward. Same thing on IP. IP, I think, has been a weaker area for us over the years, but I think it did turn around.\nOf course, one year does not make a trend, but it did turn around significantly in 2024. I think IP is up roughly 30% in 2024 and is driven by multiple reasons. One reason, our portfolio is just better technically. The PPA, especially at advanced nodes, we are delivering better power, performance, area for our IP products. Also, customers are, we are engaged now with almost all the major customers in IP. We always engage with them on EDA and hardware, but at this point, customers want more and more of our IP. The third reason is, as you know, there is a lot more foundry activity, not just the leading foundry from Taiwan, but also in other parts of the world, whether it is Intel or Samsung or Rapidus and GlobalFoundries. That also requires more and more IP and EDA.\nAs a result, I am more confident in the IP business going forward. I think it should have another good year in 2025 from what I can see right now. Also, we are investing more in the IP business in terms of expanding the portfolio. As you see, we acquired, like last year, we acquired about a year ago IP products from Rambus, and then recently we acquired Security IP, which is another critical piece of the IP portfolio. Overall, I think Cadence has been always very strong in EDA, always very strong in 3D-IC, always being very strong in hardware. IP has been one area that we wanted to do more, and especially 2024 is the turning point for IP and together positions us well into the future.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Lee Simpson with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I really just wanted to ask around the chiplet reference designs that you've clearly done very well with in China with the EV makers. Is this the sole source of strength for the chiplet reference design? Maybe if we exit that business out of China for this year, what does that do for the size of decline that we might see in China inferred in that flat number? Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nLee, that's a good question. I mean, first thing I would like to say that chiplet design is happening across the globe, and also in all verticals. It is not specific to a particular region or vertical. Of course, it started with, as you know, with high-performance computing, with all these big AI chips and server products, but now automotive and even laptops, they're all getting disaggregated. Okay.\nWe have always been focused on 3D-IC and chiplet-based design from, I don't know, maybe 15 years ago. Maybe it was too early. I think our first reference flow with TSMC on 3D-IC was like 2007 or 2008. Okay. Of course, it has picked up steam in the last few years, and we are particularly well-positioned given we have EDA products, packaging products, system products, and also IP needs to go that way. We have what I would call IP 2.0, which is more focused not just on individual IP, but silicon solutions and chiplet architectures. That's why you're seeing investment for us on chiplets, not just on the EDA side, but also on the IP side. I think it's going to happen, I believe, across all geographies, across all verticals, and it's only going to accelerate going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Shi with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nHey, good afternoon, Anirudh and John. I think I do want to ask a little bit about the core EDA. Looks like based on the segment information, the core EDA growth in 2024 was somewhere in the high single-digit range. It seems like it had been growing at more like a double digit. At the same time, the system design and analysis continue to grow at a very strong double-digit growth.\nI wonder if you can give us a little bit of your long-term view. Is this going to be the new normal going forward, like the more traditional EDA actually going to more like a high single-digit grower, but the SDNA is more like where that can contribute to Cadence outperformance going forward? I want to get your long-term thoughts there. Thanks.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nHi, Charles. Yeah, generally in core EDA, I mean, we're always targeting double-digit revenue growth, and profitable and sustainable revenue growth is really important to us. We've been very, very pleased with the progress we're making with the hardware business over the last number of years. Of course, the down year China from 2023 to 2024 impacts that core EDA growth year-over-year from 2023 to 2024. Our assumption for 2025 obviously impacts that as well. We're delighted with the value we're providing to customers, and with just the sheer demand for our products right across the core EDA space. Anirudh, do you want to add anything?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. In terms of product portfolio, I think we are better positioned than we ever have been.\nIf you look at analog, digital verification in terms of core EDA and design activity is strong. Of course, in 2024, there are two issues like John mentioned. One is China, and then also hardware had a transition year. Even though Q4 was phenomenally strong in hardware, we went through the transition in Q2 and Q3. That is, of course, part of core EDA. We will see how it proceeds going forward, but we are well-positioned. We are doing very well with customers in all these evaluations and new design starts. We will see how things progress going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Firstly, congrats on another fantastic quarter. Perhaps just a follow-up question on hardware. Given again the impressive backlog number and the increase in upfront revenue we saw this quarter, is it fair to assume that Z3 and X3 is being adopted at a faster pace and that the mix of volume and pricing is what's driving the strong Q1 guide?\nGoing forward, is it fair to assume acceleration also in upfront revenue given the closing of the air pocket? I think a fair few investors are looking at the strong hardware ramp and wondering if there is much of it inside that $6.8 billion US dollars backlog number. Any color on that would be great. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Gianmarco, it is a tremendously strong bookings quarter for hardware in Q4. We're seeing huge demand across all of our functional verification platform, so we were delighted with the progress that we've made there. We have strong backlog leading into the first quarter.\nYeah, I mean, you're seeing a more normal kind of shape to revenue this year for Cadence. We expect about 24% of the revenue to come in Q1, and similarly, about 24% in Q2. Second half of the year is going to be hard. We expect Q4 to be higher than Q3, but we'll be able to tell you more about that in the second half when we see the pipeline for hardware in the middle of the year. Anirudh, is there anything?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Hardware demand is phenomenal. Of course, Q4 strength is not based on just hardware, even though it was phenomenal. Like I mentioned, IP is doing fabulous, and overall 3D-IC, overall our complete EDA portfolio, systems growth as we saw in Q4. Specifically on hardware, I mean, as you know, we have now both new systems, Z3 and X3. They are in full production.\nWe gained several competitive wins in Q3 and Q4. It's the strength of our portfolio, which is a custom chip that we make, which is in Palladium Z3 and FPGA system for Protium. Almost all large designs, especially all large AI designs, are using Palladium as the platform of choice. I do expect that this strength will increase over time because we are the only company that designs its own chip to do emulation. If you look at this, some of the biggest chips in the world are designed through Palladium, and we have more than 100 chips in one rack, which are liquid-cooled, connected optically. You can connect 16 of these racks together. It's like more than 2,000 full reticle TSMC chips are used to emulate the world's most complicated designs. There is no other system that even comes close.\nThe nearest competitor to Palladium Z3 is actually Palladium Z2. Okay. I think going forward, and this is the nature of the architecture, also the inherent advantages it has over FPGAs. We like FPGAs. It's useful for some software workloads in Protium, but the gap between custom ASIC and FPGA is only going to increase in the future because even Z3 is a more advanced node than FPGA. You can see that in other workloads too, not just in emulation. All the AI workloads, all acceleration, custom ASIC is way superior to FPGA. Going forward, that will continue.\nIn terms of we have at least a 10-year lead in designing these custom ASICs for emulation. Hardware was phenomenal, and we expect that to continue. Now, of course, the actual second half, we'll have more updates. We have good backlog for the first half, and depending on what happens in the first half, we can update the rest of the year in the middle of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Anirudh, John, your backlog came in at about a half billion above where we were for the quarter. I assume that NVIDIA alone could certainly have accounted for a large portion of that. Your current RPO year-over-year growth progressively slowed over the course of the year from 14% year-over-year in Q1, 11%, then 7%, now 6% year-over-year as of Q4. Maybe you could dissect that in terms of the composition of software versus hardware and IP.\nMaybe on the geo side, what the current RPO growth might look like if you were to exclude China.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Jay, thanks for the question. I think what you focus on there is the annual value of the backlog. Yeah, we were very focused that we need to grow that annual value. I think that would be an important focus point for us for 2025. We're very pleased with the amount of bookings that we recorded with customers in Q4. Very, very strong pipeline got converted. We know we can do better on the annual value, and we're going to work on that for 2025. Ex-China, of course, China is a headwind to that number. We would expect the CRPO to improve naturally in 2025. I would expect the backlog number to decline a little bit in the first half.\nWe'll burn some of it in the first half just because of the timing of when renewals come up in the year. Q4 2024 was a strong renewals quarter. Q3 and Q4 are kind of the strongest renewals quarters for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. John, you seem to imply that revenue will be split 48%, 52% first half versus second half of the year, but your OpEx guide or your operating margin guide seems to imply the opposite direction, directional change for non-GAAP OpEx. Normally, you would see a second-half increase versus first half. What's the dynamic there in the OpEx for the second half versus the first half?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nHey, Gary, thanks for spotting that and giving me the opportunity to explain. We changed to a we normally have a mid-year merit cycle where we increase salaries in July. We've moved that to January and started in 2025. The profile for the year, typically in the past, you would have seen us improving margin Q1 to Q2 and then typically taking a drop-off from Q2 to Q3.\nThis year, we would expect the profitability profile to improve right throughout the year, with Q2 margins exceeding Q1, Q3 exceeding Q2, and Q4 exceeding Q3. We thought it was better to move to an annual cycle from the start of the year so as not to cause that kind of disruption in the quarter-over-quarter numbers from Q2 to Q3 going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the full-year guidance, if you drive within the upper range of the guidance for this year, your three-year revenue figure is going to drop below 15%, to be more specific, more like 13.5% for the first time in a number of years. If I look at the environment, right, you've got AI leading-edge design starts and activity are at an all-time high. You're going through a strong upgrade cycle on your hardware business.\nI know you're taking a more conservative view on China, which I think is prudent. Outside of China, we know auto and industrial semiconductor trends are still fairly muted. We also know a couple of your large leading-edge IDM customers continue to face competitive difficulties. Outside of China, can you guys just help us understand where else are you taking a more cautious view on the 2025 outlook?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah. I think, Harlan, what you're referring to is that, I mean, when you look ex-China, I mean, if we exclude China, that last year we were high-teens year-over-year growth. What's implied in the guide is low-teens year-over-year growth. I mean, normally we start the year prudently anyway. I think what you're highlighting is we believe we provide tremendous value to our customers, and it's important for our customers to extract that value from what we're providing. We focus on proliferation and adoption of our technology, and we're confident we'll extract that value from customers over time. Essentially, that's all that's in the guide. China is the kind of headwind, I guess, the assumption that that's flat. We're pleased with low-teens growth across the rest of the business.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYour next point. Yeah. One thing to point out is, of course, we are always looking at both revenue growth and profitability. I think we expect not only what I would consider good revenue growth in 2025, but also good improvement in profitability. If you add them together, like rule of 40, I think this is the first time we are guiding more than 55 in the beginning of the year. It is very important to focus on both those things, like we have done for years now.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nTaking my question. Can you hear me?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes. Yeah.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nOkay. Great. Anirudh, you talked about some of your AI products, Cerebrus, SimAI, and Allegro, all that getting traction. Help us understand how is that driving your ACV uplift right now? Are you seeing more impacts on which segment, right? Digital design, verification, any of that? In the same context, also, could you talk about, I know you talk about design going into more edge devices as another area of growth. When do you think that's going to, when are you going to see that inflection point?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Those are two good questions. In terms of AI product itself, like we have mentioned in the past, we have these five major platforms, which now, at this point, we are engaged with all our major customers on. Of course, a few years ago, we started with digital implementation, which is Cadence Cerebrus. I think at this point, Cadence Cerebrus is adopted with all our major customers, and then verification with Verisium, and then Allegro X, Optimality, Virtuoso Studio.\nThese are all platforms which are something you have to add to your base config, right? We are seeing customers adopt more and more of these solutions. In terms of your question on edge, I always believe I said so many times in the past that AI will have multiple phases to it. Of course, the first phase was more infrastructure, more on the data center side. I believe one of the biggest phases will be what we have called for a long time as Physical AI, which will be more in the physical world, more edge devices, more cars, robots, and drones. Also, sciences AI with things like life sciences and material sciences. It will go through at least these three big horizons.\nThe good thing with the Physical AI, which is more on the edge or more if they are more power-constrained applications, we are already seeing a lot of design activity starting on that. Some of the products may come out a few years later. Just like on the data center side, we saw products in 2022 or 2023, but the design activity was there a few years before that. Especially in Physical AI, they are by nature edge and also more mixed signal, in which Cadence is very well positioned. That's why I'm saying even though there is weakness right now in the autos in terms of semi-revenue, in terms of investment in R&D, there's a lot of investment in R&D with EVs and self-driving. Same thing with drones and robots, which is independent of humanoid robots.\nIndustrial application and aero and defense applications will be huge for those things. I think that will drive a different kind of AI and require even more domain-specific silicon for AI on those devices.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in at the end here. I'm just going to keep it to two quick clarifications. My first one is on China. I know there's been a lot of questions, but I guess, John, I'm just trying to understand, has anything changed since last quarter that's either increasing or decreasing your conviction that China won't have two down years in a row? On the hardware side, if I remember correctly, historically, you talked to how you tend to only guide to six months of visibility specifically for hardware.\nAre you taking a similar approach this year as you set the guidance for 2025?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks, Josh. Yeah. Taking the second question first, yes, exactly the same approach. Hardware is a pipeline business. We typically have good visibility into the pipeline about two quarters out. We finished with a very, very strong kind of hardware bookings quarter in Q4 and have plenty of backlog to deliver against in the first half of the year. Demand, the pipeline still looks strong, but visibility into the pipeline this time of the year is more difficult. We'll have more visibility into hardware in the second half by the time we get to the summer. Exactly the same approach that you've seen us do in previous years. Your question on China, can you repeat it again?\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nHas anything changed since last quarter that's either increasing or decreasing your conviction that China won't have two down years in a row?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nOh, I'm just worried about my ability to predict what China revenue would be. I mean, I was very pleased that all through last year, Q1 was the low quarter, Q2 was higher than Q1, Q3 was higher than Q2, Q4 ended up higher than Q3 for China revenue. It's tough to have visibility into the pipeline for Q1 because quarters are only getting assigned now, and the salespeople tend to keep their cards very close to their chest this time of the year. I thought, in the absence of any other information, the prudent thing would be to de-risk the guide and assume flat for China. If our experience is better than that, we'll take the guide up through the year.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence as we enter 2025 with product leadership and strong business momentum. Our continued execution of the intelligent system design strategy, customer-first mindset, and our high-performance culture are driving growth and profitability. Fortune and Great Place to Work named Cadence as one of the world's best workplaces in 2024, ranking it number nine. On behalf of our employees and our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's Cadence Q4 and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Cadence delivered strong financial results for the second quarter of 2024, with broad-based momentum across our product portfolio. Bookings were stronger than expected, leading to a healthy backlog and underscoring the robust demand for our innovative technologies. We exceeded our outlook on all key metrics and are updating our revenue guidance for the year to over 13% year-over-year growth. John will provide more details on both our Q2 results and updated outlook for the year. Generational trends such as hyperscale computing, 5G, and autonomous driving, all underpinned by the AI supercycle, are driving strong design activity across multiple verticals, particularly in data center and automotive, along with increasing chip complexity and system companies building their own silicon. These trends are creating tremendous tailwinds for our differentiated solutions.\nWe are steadfastly executing to our intelligent system design strategy, extending our leadership in Core EDA while steadily expanding our footprint in the new system design analysis area. Customers are ramping up their R&D spend in AI-driven automation. Our Cadence.AI portfolio, offering unparalleled quality of results and productivity benefits, continues to gain momentum. With orders more than tripling over the last year, our solutions are enabling the massive AI infrastructure buildout across the semi and system space. Additionally, we continue embedding AI in our EDA, SDA, and digital biology solutions. In Q2, our long-term development partner NVIDIA broadly deployed Palladium Z3 to deliver to its next-generation AI product roadmap, further solidifying Cadence's leadership in the industry. A marquee hyperscaler meaningfully expanded its partnership with Cadence in Q2 through a broad proliferation of our Cadence.AI, EDA, SDA, and hardware portfolio.\nThe growing foundry ecosystem is driving increased design activity and creating significant opportunities for our industry-leading products. In Q2, we expanded our collaboration with several leading foundry partners. We announced that Cadence.AI, digital, and analog tools were optimized for Samsung's advanced node SF2 Gate-All-Around process, driving enhanced quality of results and accelerating node migration. We extended our long-standing collaboration with TSMC through a very comprehensive and innovative technology advancement, ranging from 3D-IC to design IP and photonics, and providing optimized digital and analog full flows for TSMC's latest N2 process technologies. Our Integrity 3D-IC platform is the industry's leading unified design analysis and sign-off platform for multi-chiplet architectures. Integrity has been certified for all of TSMC's latest 3DFabric offerings and now has enabled several new features like hierarchical 3D-IC design.\nWe also announced that Integrity has been enabled for all of Samsung Foundry's multi-die integration offerings, accelerating the design assembly of stacked chiplets. Additionally, we released a complete Intel Foundry EMIB Advanced Packaging Reference Flow that is optimized to work seamlessly with Intel 18A technology. We are also collaborating with multiple foundries to optimize our industry-leading IP cores for AI, HPC, mobile, and automotive applications for their advanced process technology, so as to ensure seamless integration into customer designs. We saw strong momentum in our IP business, with it delivering 25% year-over-year growth in Q2 as we executed to our profitable and scalable growth strategy. AI use cases, HPC, and heterogeneous integration were the primary drivers fueling the demand for our HBM, PCIe, GDDR, 112 GB SerDes, and UCIE products.\nWe expanded our system IP portfolio with the addition of Cadence Janus Network on Chip solution that manages high-speed communications effectively with minimum latency, enabling customers to achieve their PPA targets faster and with lower risk. Emulation and prototyping have become mission-critical elements of chip design and software bring-up flows. Following the launch of our market-leading Z3 and X3 platforms, there is robust demand for these best-in-class systems, particularly by AI, hyperscale, and automotive companies, and we continue to ramp up our production capacity accordingly. Verisium, our AI-driven verification platform, continued seeing rapid customer adoption with several market-shaping customers, including Qualcomm, successfully using Verisium SIM AI for coverage maximization and achieving up to a 20x reduction in verification workload time.\nOur system design and analysis business continued its strong momentum in Q2, delivering 20% year-over-year revenue growth as chiplet-based architectures gain traction. Our industry-leading Integrity 3D-IC platform had increased adoption and expansion from large deployments at 5G, hyperscale, memory, and consumer customers. Our AI-enabled Allegro X design platform is being rapidly adopted and driving competitive displacement, as multiple aerospace and defense, hyperscalers, and EV customers take advantage of the platform's productivity and next-generation capabilities. Allegro X's InDesign analysis capabilities are also driving a pull-through of our multiphysics analysis solutions. In Q2, a leading EV auto company forged a strategic partnership with Cadence, making a significant investment across the breadth of our multiphysics portfolio. With the close of BETA CAE in Q2, we now offer a comprehensive multiphysics platform covering electromagnetics, electrothermal, CFD, and structural analysis solutions.\nOur digital IC and custom businesses delivered another solid quarter, proliferation of our digital full flow at the most advanced nodes continued with close to 40 full flow wins over the last 12 months, especially at hyperscalers with over 400 tape outs. Customers are increasingly relying on Cadence Cerebrus, the leading AI tool in the industry, as it continues to deliver amazing PPA and productivity benefits. For example, Cadence Cerebrus has been delivering up to a 10% PPA gain for a global marquee systems company and is now deployed as part of the default flow for their latest designs. At the most advanced nodes, Samsung Foundry leveraged Cadence Cerebrus in both DTCO and implementation to achieve more than a 10% leakage power reduction on their SF2 gate-all-around platform.\nSocionext utilize SerDes closure and Tempus sign off to reduce timing closure time by 73% and double productivity while reducing memory cost by 90%. Our AI-driven Virtuoso Studio is the leading automated solution for analog and RF designs, and its new AI features allow much more efficient migration from one process node to another. Virtuoso Studio added 35 new logos in Q2, led by top hyperscalers, aerospace and defense, and automotive customers. In summary, I'm pleased with our Q2 results and the continuing momentum of our business. The AI-driven automation era offers massive opportunities, and the co-optimization of our comprehensive EDA and SDA portfolio with accelerated computing and AI orchestration uniquely positions us to provide disruptive solutions to multiple markets.\nNow I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q2 results and our updated 2024 outlook.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered strong results for the second quarter of 2024, finishing the first half with backlog of approximately $6 billion. Also, we expanded our multiphysics platform in Q2 by completing the acquisition of BETA CAE. Here are some of the financial highlights from the second quarter. Starting with P&L, total revenue was $1,061 million, GAAP operating margin was 27.7%, non-GAAP operating margin was 40.1%, GAAP EPS was $0.84, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.28. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash balance at quarter end was $1,059 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $1,350 million. Operating cash flow was $156 million. DSOs were 49 days, and we used $125 million to repurchase Cadence shares in Q2.\nBefore I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to share some assumptions that are embedded. Our updated outlook includes BETA CAE, and it contains the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year. Our updated outlook for 2024 is revenue in the range of $4.6 to 4.66 billion. GAAP operating margin in the range of 29.7% to 31.3, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 41.7% to 43.3, GAAP EPS in the range of $3.82 to 4.02, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.77 to 5.97, operating cash flow in the range of $1 billion to 1.2 billion, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares. With that in mind, for Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $1,165 million to 1,195 million, GAAP operating margin in the range of 27.7% to 29.3, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 40.7% to 42.3. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.83 to 0.93, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to 1.49.\nAs usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our investor relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, I am pleased with our strong Q2 results. We exceeded our outlook on all key financial metrics. A good finish for the first half and ongoing demand for our solutions sets us up for strong growth in the second half of 2024. As always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will open the line for questions. At this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. Now, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Charles Shi with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nManaging Director of Senior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nHey, good afternoon.Thanks for taking my questions. Anirudh and John, maybe the first question, I do want to ask a fairly big question, a big picture one. You did pick up your outlook. For the year, some of that really comes from BETA CAE. The broader question is the semiconductor, global semiconductor sales. It's on track to grow a lot faster, let's say, compared with you and even your peer Synopsys. This seems to me kind of like a reversal of the trend of the last three years when you actually did outgrow the semiconductors. With so much AI being a big driver for semiconductors, we do wonder whether it's either through pricing or through some other measures. Cadence can actually gain a little bit bigger piece of the pie from overall semiconductor, especially from AI. I don't know if you can provide some thoughts today. I'm not necessarily asking how to change the trend in terms of the value capture, but any thoughts will be great. Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nYeah, hi Charles, thanks for the question. I mean, first of all, I'd like to say that, you know, overall we are pleased with how we are performing. You know, if you step back, because you asked a longer term question, right, if you step back, you know we will deliver. We expect, you know, more than 13% revenue growth, and, you know, about 42.5% operating margin. I think that's a best-in-class combination of both revenue growth and operating margin.\nIf you look at our CAGR over the last three years, which is one of our kind of favorite metrics, that's also performing pretty well in terms of growth and margin expansion. You mentioned semicycle. I mean, it is encouraging to see that there is going to be growth this year, which was not there last year. As you all know, Charles, we are tied to the R&D spend more than the revenue of our customers. Of course, if the revenue goes up, they're more likely to spend on R&D. In general, our customers, both system and semi companies, continue to spend on R&D, and these are long-term projects. We'll see how that goes as the semiconductor revenue improves. This is not an instantaneous effect on R&D spend. You know, there's always some lag sometimes. We are encouraged to see the improvement in semi spending overall and in semiconductor revenue.\nI would like to say, you can see in our backlog also, we maintain a pretty healthy backlog. Overall, I think things are performing well, and this AI is broadening out. I mean, you know this well, you know AI is broadening out beyond data center, which we are glad to have great partnerships to automotive, to more edge consumer devices like phones and PCs. Overall, I feel pretty good about the industry and, of course, our position in IT as the essential provider of design software.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nManaging Director of Senior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it. Maybe a quick follow-up on China. Looks like China revenue is still pretty light in the second quarter. I recall you were thinking maybe China contributions are probably going to be slightly less than the mid-teens or less than 15%. Even if, let me assume the China revenue gets to like 14% ish, it still implies a little bit of a second half reacceleration of China revenue growth. Is that still the case, or you think maybe compared with three months ago China actually may get a little bit weaker than you previously thought. Thanks.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks for the question, Charles. Regional revenue is notoriously hard to predict. I will say that at the midpoint of our current revenue guide, we only need China to get to 13% of overall revenue to be able to hit that midpoint. I mean, when you look at performance in Q2, in the first half we had very strong bookings. First half, very pleased with customers' response to our new hardware systems. The IP and SDA businesses continue to grow strongly. Core businesses continue to scale really well. You know, we're focused on profitable revenue growth. I know in your first question you indicated that we hadn't raised the outlook, but we did raise non-GAAP EPS by $0.06. We're very pleased with the improvement in profitability.\nWhen you look at the current guide, we're actually on track for 50% incremental margin excluding the impact of B2C. You know, B2C is in our guide, but it's in our guide at what we previously communicated in the press release, $40 million of revenue, and about $0.12 dilution to non-GAAP EPS. There is an impact to op cash as a result of BETA CAE as well. Overall, very, very pleased. We thought it was prudent to assume lower China revenue for this year at the midpoint of our guide. That's it. We only need 13% to get to the midpoint of guidance.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nManaging Director of Senior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nThanks, Anirudh, John for the additional color. Appreciate it, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, hi there. Thank you so much for taking my questions. On my first one, could you talk a little bit about the implied Q4 ramp up to 29% growth at the midpoint of guidance, and what has given you the confidence in reaching the target? Is it mostly hardware visibility coming through, or are there an unusually higher number of Q4 renewals that you're waiting for? Any color here would be great. Thank you.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, Gianmarco. I mean, there's no real change from what we said last quarter. I mean, it's effectively the shape of the revenue curve for the year. We're expecting upfront revenue. A lot more upfront revenue in the second half is just the timing of shipments really. That upfront revenue typically comes from IP, hardware, and, to a lesser extent, some software. On the SDA side. With the hardware, it takes time to build the systems. We have higher revenue in Q4 versus Q3 as a result, but also from IP. There's IP. We recognize revenue in IP based on the timing of deliveries. We're confident in that guide. It's just the shape of Q3 and Q4 is what we have in the guide now.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, great. My follow up would be on hardware. If you could talk a little bit about how much visibility you have actually in H2. Are you booking and delivering in the same quarter, hence why we're not seeing a major uplift in backlog growth, or is there a different dynamic to it? I'm trying to understand if you're booking, manufacturing, and delivering all in the same quarter for hardware, essentially. Thank you.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks for the question. Yes, in some cases on the newer systems, there is a timeline, a lead time to building the systems. We have more bookings than our ability to actually fulfill those bookings. We do have some inventory of the older systems, and we're able to deliver those in the quarter. Yes, I mean there's always a mix. We did have a challenge in the past with getting inventory and building the inventory as fast as we could for the demand. I think we've dealt with a lot of that. You'll also see in the OpCash guide, we're planning to purchase a significant amount of raw materials for building inventory in Q3. That's the biggest portion of the change in OpCash, guys.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nAlso, just to add on the overall hardware cycle, as you remember, we launched new systems in April, you know, just a couple of months ago, a few months ago now. The response to them has been phenomenal, actually. We, you know, these Palladium, especially both Palladium and Protium, but these systems can design chips like I mentioned last time with capacity of 1 trillion transistors. The current biggest chip is like 200 billion transistors. Most of them are, you know, 100 billion or less. We are 5 to 10x higher capacity than what is needed, you know, so that should suit the industry well for, you know, next several years. I'm also pretty pleased about is that we delivered production deployment of our new systems to some very major customers.\nWe highlighted NVIDIA, our development partner, with a significant deployment of Z3, also one of the leading mobile system companies in the world and one of the leading hyperscalers. It's across multiple markets that we delivered our latest systems, which are performing exceedingly well. That sets up very well for the future, also competitively. We have a significant lead given the nature of our systems. You know, it's a combination of Protium, which is based on FPGA, and then Palladium is based on our own chip at advanced TSMC process. Cadence is the only solution that does that and provides a unique value. Overall, I think hardware business is performing well, and as you know, these are multi-year upgrade cycles. This is not all in 2024. We'll see how things go in 2025 and 2026.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. On an absolute basis in fiscal 2024, you know, organic sales growth rate is robust, but in terms of revisions it has stalled. Right. Essentially no real movement since what you suggested at the start of the year. I'm curious, Anirudh, how has the year transpired versus what you thought, and how do you think about bookings and backlog trends into the second half? Should we expect that backlog stays around the $6 billion? Will it start to just. I'm trying to understand that should we be thinking about sales accelerating from here, or, you know, this being kind of the sustainable growth rate for the company?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nYeah, Hi Vivek, good question. In general, what I would like to say is, you know, like we mentioned last two times, the shape of the curve this year is unique to, you know, Cadence. You know, given multiple factors, this is not what we expected last two years. This time it's more back end loaded for the reasons we mentioned before. The guide is a little different. We are also, given that shape of the curve, more prudent in our guide like we were in Q2. We would rather overachieve and deliver that and give the team flexibility to do the right business for the long term. I think that's the difference this year versus last few years. Given the shape of the curve, we have more prudence in our revenue guide like John mentioned.\nJohn can comment on the backlog expectations.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, I mean we don't guide bookings, but we were very pleased with the strong bookings in the first half. I get the question, Vivek. I mean essentially, you know, we're seeing strong, strong demand for our hardware systems. We're seeing strength across all our businesses. I guess your question is that when you add in B2C, you're not really taking the revenue guide up. I think essentially if your question is what would we like to see improve, I think it's the China revenue percentage. It was 12% in Q1, 12% in Q2, it improved in Q2 over Q1, and we think it will continue to improve through the year. Right now our guide only needs to get to 13% China to hit the midpoint of that guidance.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nFor my follow up, you mentioned BETA CAE quite a drag to EPS. I think you mentioned $0.12 dilution and almost, I think, what is like a $300 million hit to operating cash flows. Can you describe that acquisition a little more, and when does it start to become accretive to your financials? Thank you.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, Vivek, on the $300 million drop in operating cash. Just to clarify, about 40% of that $300 million drop is due to M&A. I mean, things like BETA CAE. Some of the purchase, the geography of where the operating or where the cash impact goes, it flows. Some of that payment flows through op cash. The bigger portion of the impact on operating cash is our plan to purchase a lot of inventory, raw materials for the hardware demand that we're seeing. We're pre-purchasing a lot of inventory. You'll see our inventory spike in Q3 with all of the raw materials we're purchasing. We want to make sure that we have all the raw materials necessary to ramp up the build out of our hardware systems. In relation to BETA CAE, I mean, it's a very recent acquisition.\nIt's no different to what we have in the press release. In the press release we said we were expecting $40 million revenue at the midpoint, that's embedded now in the guide. We're expecting $0.12 dilution on non-GAAP EPS, that's also in the guide now, and we expect it to be, I mean, operationally it'll be accretive next year. There are some interest costs associated with the debt, but we think it'll. Be accretive next year.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nAlso a couple of things to clarify. One thing, this purchase of inventory for the hardware systems, I mean that will be used over multiple years. It's not just for 2024. I think it's a one-time investment that pays for several years, and that's a prudent decision to make to get the right kind of parts for the future. On BETA CAE, it completes our system analysis portfolio to add structural analysis, and it also strengthens our position in automotive. Of course, data center is a big vertical with all the AI supercycle. I think one of the other exciting verticals is automotive, with all this electrification and also AI getting added in self-driving or driver assistance. We see a lot of design activity in automotive. Automotive is also moving through chiplets and 3D-IC.\nI think automotive has all the three tenets of our IST strategy. It has silicon content that is increasing, and more and more system design, of course, is needed for the design automotive and AI for all the data and computational software. For that reason, you know, BETA CAE completes our portfolio in automotive and positions us well in the future. This is not just with the semiconductor companies doing automotive, but also the system companies now. You know, OEMs doing more and more chip design, doing more of our system solutions. I also want to highlight and congratulate McLaren. There was big news this weekend. McLaren got one and two in Hungarian F1. We have been working with them for the last few months and years, and it's good to see them do well as we deploy.\nI think the automotive solution that we are driving is a combination of silicon, system, and then AI. We are seeing the results of that through organic and inorganic expansion.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, can you hear me?\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nLoud and clear, Josh.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. The first one is just kind of more of a clarification. I know there's been a lot of questions around the mix in upfront versus recurring. I guess what I'm just trying to understand is, and I could be wrong with my math here, but it feels like the upfront component was still a little light in Q2, and now we're a little bit more second half weighted, more Q4 weighted, because you need time to develop inventory. Am I thinking about that the right way?\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThat's fair. Josh, I would do the inverse on you in terms of bookings were stronger than we expected in Q2, and we got some uplift in recurring revenue. Took a bit of pressure off on the upfront side. We are, -- I mean, we're taking orders, we've got strong demand for the hardware, and we're building those hardware systems as quickly as we can, particularly the newer hardware orders. IP is doing really well, and system design analysis is doing really well. What we reflected in the guide is our expectation of how much of that revenue will fall in Q3 and Q4. We took the opportunity, we really de-risked the guide for the year by reducing our expectations for China upfront. We still expect to be in a range of 80% to 85.\nBut I. Think we might get slightly more recurring revenue as a result of the strong bookings in the first half.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nThat is super clear. I guess just my follow up to that is, I guess it's another visibility question, but how much of what's baked into the guide from an upfront perspective do you feel like you have, like, you know, good inventory levels to meet that guidance, or does the guidance that you put out today still require you to build and develop inventory between now and shipping those boxes.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, it's. We definitely need to build hardware, and you'll see the impact on our inventory in Q3 with the amount of raw materials we're purchasing. As Anirudh says, you know, that's a one-time thing that we're doing to try and get raw materials and to build those systems as quickly as we can. A lot of the upfront revenue in the second half comes from the strength in our IP business, and we have those orders in backlog, and it's just a case of executing against those. We also have some SDA, or system design analysis, upfront revenue that's scheduled to occur in Q3 and Q4. Again, most of that is from orders in the system.\nOn the hardware side, it's kind of mid to high single digits is what we were expecting the SVG group to deliver to be able to hit the midpoint of that guidance.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nSuper, super helpful. Just a quick follow up, it is really awesome to see the recurring revenue growing sequentially this quarter. Is there any way you can maybe help us on what the expected recurring versus upfront mix is supposed to be in Q3, and then I'll cede the floor.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nOh, I don't have that to hand, but let me come back to that. Let's see if I can dig it out here.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks guys. Congrats.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nYes, thank you. John, just a very quick question, and then I guess a follow up, and then I'll ask a real question. On the inventory purchases, am I right in assuming that that's mostly for the Z3 and X3? Has anything changed in terms of when you're thinking about general availability of those hardware products?\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, that's correct. The vast majority of the purchases are to get raw materials to help build those new systems.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nIn terms of the type.--\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nJust to clarify, I mean also I mean we have two systems, right? Palladiums we design ourselves and we manufacture the chip in TSMC, and Protium we also design ourselves. The silicon itself is primarily from AMD with Xilinx FPGAs. A lot of this purchase is for X3s and the FPGAs, and that should serve us for multiple years. On Z3, like we said, we are already shipping them and they're already deployed in production this quarter. I think Z3 is slightly different than X3 in terms of the mix of the silicon content. Just to clarify that.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nOkay, I apologize, Andrew. I thought they were going to, you know, sort of certain customers not generally available, but thank you for that. The real question just around some of your top customers have been accelerating the rhythm of bringing sort of their very complex chips to market. NVIDIA and AMD certainly have accelerated their roadmaps to sort of a one year rhythm. Are you seeing any changes in sort of the way your business is impacted or affected kind of by the acceleration of their product roadmaps yet?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nYes, I would like to. I think we're seeing more and more design activity. You know, like you said, the rhythm or the cadence of the products, and also different kind of chips. You know, it's not just the, it's not just the big data center chips, but even within them, you know, there is more and more customization. Of course, the Hyperscaler is doing their own silicon. Now, you know, we talked about our partnership with, for example, Qualcomm, and they are doing consumer or edge laptop AI devices. The amount of AI is also spreading to other verticals, not just obvious. The big one on data center and data center design is accelerating. I think when we look at it, we still see that the data center part of AI still should accelerate, at least the visibility we have for next couple of years. We'll see how that goes.\nTherefore, the other thing is automotive. Now, automotive takes normally a little longer, but they are already seeing design activity, and the deployment may be a few years down, you know, maybe after data center, and then consumer and PCs already starting with, you know, phones and laptops. Overall, we do see accelerating deployment of AI into the whole semiconductor ecosystem, and we are very proud of our position in it, whether it's 3D-IC, whether it is data center chips, or whether it's our own AI products. We are winning almost all kind of engagements on our Cadence.AI portfolio. Overall, we do see more and more design and deployment of AI infrastructure and our own AI product.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nIf I could just come back to Josh's question. Sorry, if I could just come back to Josh's question on the revenue mix for Q3, for recurring revenue we expect, sorry, 80% to 85% of revenue to be recurring for the year. Q3 includes the middle of that range, and then the balance is Q4. You can do the math and work out what the upfront piece is.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Anirudh, question about the evolution of the product portfolio for EDA generally and perhaps for SDA specifically. What I'd like to ask about is how you're thinking about packaging the products. Over the last year you've introduced a couple of products with the term studio. In the name, and I'm wondering if you're thinking about more and more bundling or packaging of that kind via that nomenclature for the EDA products, and then specifically for SDA. Now that you do have multiple codes, how are you thinking about packaging or integrating across the various simulation codes that you've assembled now in acquisition? I'll ask my follow up.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nYeah, hi Jay, good question. I mean as you know in EDA, when we go to lower nodes, you know there is more integrated solutions which are required. You know, it's digital or analog or verification, and that is further accelerated by use of AI. You know, like Cerebrus, for example, in digital will integrate, you know, not just place and route, but also synthesis and sign off. I think that trend is definitely there. Same thing with Verisium, our leading AI product for verification, also integrates the four major verification platforms we have. It is more and more platform-driven approach, and we can do that now with SDA now that we have a complete portfolio, and we mentioned a leading EV company like OEM, one of the leading, the most advanced EV companies deployed our entire portfolio.\nAs we have a bigger portfolio in SDA, it does let us do what we have always done in EDA, focus on solutions, not just on individual products, and integrate solutions with our own kind of native integration, whether it's analog, digital, verification, and now with SDA.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nAll right, as follow up, I know it's still quite early in the propagation of AI and ML by you and your peers to the customers, but are you beginning to see any commonality or convergence towards a relatively small number of use cases that customers are mostly employing the tools for? Relatedly, are you also seeing AI ML adoption having any meaningful effect on your services revenue?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nYes, Jay. What I would like to say is that the number of use cases I see is increasing at this point. I mean, of course, one of the, you know, one of the biggest use cases that we started with was digital implementation since it is so kind of heavy kind of design process. Automating the digital implementation process was a huge benefit. We talked even this quarter about Cerebrus being deployed at one of the leading system companies for the default flow, also used by Samsung. Also, you see verification being used by Qualcomm. I think what is happening in that Cerebrus or the implementation use case, two things. One is that it is going not just for design but also for DTCO, design technology co-optimization, and also for higher level in the design process like floor planning and 3D-IC exploration.\nIt's all not just for implementation of the design but also for architecture and exploration. The other thing is there's more workflow automation. As customers get used to Cerebrus, they are using it not just towards the end of the design process, they're using it right from the beginning throughout the design process. It allows us to do more workflow automation. Cerebrus has also evolved to allow much more of an entire workflow rather than a specific implementation use case. The same thing is happening in terms of more and more use cases. For example, packaging, Allegro X is doing pretty well and, you know, recently one of the leading customers in 3D-IC used its capability to automate, for example, routing for automating, you know, placement, which was not there before in PCB and package design.\nOverall, I do think it's maturing of the workflows. With these LLMs and Gen AI, you know, we have several workflows for taking spec to RTL, and we highlighted some of them last quarter. I actually do see finally that in the, you know, we are always kind of building out the AI infrastructure, you know, these big companies designing chips. I do see now there's a turning point in deployment of AI for the design process, with the initial workflow being Cerebrus and digital implementation. Now to expanding to LLM-based spec, expanding to DTCO, expanding to 3D-IC, of course expanding to analog packaging verification. We do have the most comprehensive AI portfolio in terms of all five major product lines. Actually, it's a pretty encouraging view compared to a year ago.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Anirudh. Thank you, John.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JP Morgan\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Is the bookings profile for the full year still expected to be 40% first half, 60% second half? If it is, that would imply book to bill greater than 1 for the full year. Total backlog up about 9% this year to about $6.5 billion. I guess how much of that backlog is due to the BETA CAE acquisition? What I'm just trying to figure out is ex BETA CAE if core Cadence orders and backlog are expected to be up this year, which would continue the strong sort of six to seven year trend of increasing orders and backlog for the team.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, Harlan, again, like I said, we're not guiding bookings, but we were very, very pleased with a strong first half for bookings. The BETA CAE contribution to backlog is very, very small. It's immaterial because BETA CAE, their revenue is upfront. It adds the upfront piece of the business rather than the recurring revenue. Yeah, we're very pleased. I mean, you can typically expect us to always be driving for a book to bill of greater than 1, but we don't guide, we don't guide book.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JP Morgan\n\nOkay, perfect. Thank you. Anirudh, there's a pretty interesting dynamic with your memory customers, right? They're big customers of your custom product family, Virtuoso, but they are moving more and more to advanced digital design. Right. The HBM control logic chip, for example, is moving to leading edge technologies and advanced chip design. Similarly, with some of your NAND customers, they're moving towards more of this sort of bonded CMOS periphery to array. The periphery chip, again, is also moving towards advanced digital design as well. Are you starting to see more adoption of your advanced digital implementation and verification products by your memory customers? Does the leadership in memory via Virtuoso sort of give you an advantage as they bring on more advanced logic design capabilities?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nYes, Alan, that's a great observation. We are fortunate to have very deep and long-standing partnerships with all the major memory companies. You know, at least there are three big ones, and then, you know, maybe two at the next level. Overall, we are, you know, given our strength, like you mentioned, in Virtuoso, which is the platform of choice for all memory implementation. Yes, there is a lot more digital and implementation design happening at memory companies, you know, primarily driven by HBM and other trends. Actually, you know, also there is some kind of, I mean, they were always doing, they were always doing digital, but it's a lot more now, and there is a trend of even integrating, you know, TSMC technologies with kind of memory.\nGiven our strong partnership with TSMC, that also helps us with the memory companies, and as you know, they are also doing a lot more 3D-IC. You know, all the three big memory companies, and these memory layers are going from, you know, they're actually one of the most advanced 3D-IC with the memory layers going from 8 to 12. That also, you know, plays to our strengths. Even in my prepared remarks, I mentioned, for example, our partnership with Samsung and 3D-IC. The same is true with the other two major players in memory. We are pleased in our position in memory and the emerging trends of HBM and 3D-IC integration, and we'll see how that progresses. I think memory is often overlooked.\nI don't need to tell you, but just in general, memory is often overlooked in the big AI Supercycle. It's not the big chips, logic chips, but memories play a very essential role, and we are very well positioned both with the leaders like NVIDIA on the logic side, and then we highlighted Samsung and the other big memory players in general.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JP Morgan\n\nThank you for the insights.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. Lots of questions so far on the hardware timing. I think, John, on prior calls you said that the hardware delivery times typically are like 8 to 10 weeks. That's what it is for like a normal cycle. Are you saying the lead times for the Z3, X3 are longer than this because the demand is much better than what you're seeing?\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nDemand is strong. Demand is strong. What I was trying to point out was that we do have inventory of the older systems that we can deliver right away. The newer systems, we're having to build them as quickly as we can because the orders are coming in faster than. We can build them. Lead times is a bit of a moving target in that respect. We are planning to purchase a lot of raw materials and build as quickly as we can in Q3. You'll see a significant uptick in our inventory balance at the end of Q3.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay, no, that's helpful. Just a clarification. I think you were saying like the. SDA group to hit your guide needed to do like mid to high single digit growth. I'm not familiar with SDA. Is that the functional verification kind of guide for the year? You know, if you're parsing out like does that imply what do we need to see on IP since that's the other upfront component to hit the guide. Thanks.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, that's fair. Yeah, IP is having a really, really strong year, as is system design analysis. They'll be our two fastest growers for the year. There's some upfront revenue from them. It's more weighted towards Q4 versus Q3, so the shape of the curve is really driving our guide. I would categorize it as prudent. Anirudh, would you add anything?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nNo, that's right, John. Sorry for the acronym, SVG is System Verification Group. When we say SVG, that means verification. I think that's what John was implying. Verification should grow. Right now we are not assuming massive growth in verification for this year, but it should grow compared to last year. Like you mentioned, some of the upfront revenue is also IP. If you remember, we highlighted in Q1 a new partnership with Intel. You know, we are deploying our IP portfolio for the Intel process. It takes time to do that and deliver to that. Some of it is in Q3 and Q4. This time we talked about our expansion, you know, partnership with Intel on both EMIB, their packaging and 3D-IC platform, and 18A, just to clarify.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nVery good stuff. Yeah, thanks for the lingo acronym help, and it was very helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lee Simpson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for fitting me in, and well done in a good quarter. Just want to get some clarification. I don't know if I heard correctly, but I think I heard you say that a mobile OEM had taken the Z3 platform. If that's the case, do you have a sense for what the emulation work might be? Would it be for chips on device, or would it be for chips both on device and perhaps in, let's say, a network situation? Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nWell, good question. You know, we don't comment on individual customer or specific customer use cases. In general, you know, these hardware systems, as you know, are used both for chip design and for system software bring up. Both use cases are there, and you know, we are the leading platform given Palladium and Protium. This is true for all, even in the AI use case, you know, even in the data center AI use case. A lot of it is for software development. Actually, Palladium is the platform of choice, even for our AI chip customers, to give a model to their customers, you know, because even before they have a chip, they can give a Palladium model to see how it performs. It's both for chip design and also for system design and system software. That's true for multiple, multiple major verticals. Data center, mobile, automotive. Yes, thank you.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, thanks. Just on those multiple verticals, if we look at the incidence of 3D-ICs coming through, I get the sense that that's starting to hit the tape. Now in automotive, you have mentioned EV companies as collaboration of late, but you have mentioned a number of chip makers also. I wonder if it's possible at this point or even if it's relevant to just maybe talk about the split between the customers. Are we talking system customers, that is OEMs and tier ones, in the majority right now, or is it still major semi chip makers for the automotive work?Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nGreat question. First, yes, like you correctly pointed out, I think the 3D-IC is a lot more prevalent in automotive than, let's say, 6 to 12 months ago. Of course, the original genesis is HPC and data center AI, but now all these chiplets and 3D-IC platforms are moving to automotive.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence",
    "content2": "I think over time we'll move to other verticals like consumer. You know, they already moved to laptop, for example. You know, several of the laptop chips are 3D-IC, but I think that will be the progression. It will gradually go to all verticals, but definitely active in automotive because, as you know, you know, with the chiplet architecture, you know, the customer doesn't have to redesign all the chips, and also they can use some standard chips and have some standard specific which are more value added for them. That's particularly true in automotive, as each OEM wants to differentiate versus the other OEM. This trend is not just for semi companies, to your question, it's also there in OEMs, and I think that's easily more.\nI do think that the 3D-IC trend makes even more sense for end OEMs because then they're able to customize and differentiate versus the other. We are seeing that and we are seeing that in other geographies as well, you know, because as you know, China is pretty strong in EVs and then US and then Japan, there's a lot of activity. Overall, I think automotive, there is more activity on 3D-IC, including both Semi and OEMs.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, Anirudh. Great color.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nClarke Jeffries\n\nVP and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHello. Thank you for taking the question. My first question is, you know, Anirudh, how do you expect the delivery of these third generation systems to translate to additional software consumption in the recurring revenue portfolio? You know, these products are happening with verification acceleration software bring up. You know, how do you see that additional consumption panning out after the delivery of a new ZRX system? I have one follow up.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nYeah, great question. I mean like what John was saying, when we say SVG, you know, system verification group, hardware is part of that group, you know, even though hardware is a significant business. We organize it as part of verification. One of the big reasons for that is, apart from verification, apart from the hardware systems, we have a lot of other verification products, you know, which are doing pretty well, like Jasper for formal verification, Xcelium for logic stimulation. The customer is looking for an integrated solution on verification. To the earlier question that Jay had, you know, about, you know, what is happening in SDA, in EDA, we always have believed for the last several years that it's going to be integrated solution in verification. The stronger our hardware products get, we do expect it should help our software verification products.\nYou know, things like Xcelium, Jasper, and Verisium, because some of the hardware capacity is also used for what is called SIM Excel, simulation acceleration, in which they use Palladium to accelerate logic simulations. There is a natural tie-in between verification software products and verification hardware products. Now, exactly how it pans out, we just have to see. The strength in hardware should help us in our overall portfolio strength.\n\nClarke Jeffries\n\nVP and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. One follow up for John. I think just to kind of finally put a cap on the whole discussion around timing, I guess then is it fair to say that that sort of $600 million of upfront revenue in the second half, maybe a majority of that is coming from IP and SDA and not necessarily the Gen 3 systems in that maybe the interpretation is that there's going to be more of a demand curve in the beginning of 2025 rather than this $600 million being strongly driven by 3rd Gen Palladium and Protium. Is that a fair takeaway?\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nI think that is, Clarke. Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, we always knew that it would take time to build the hardware system, so we originally included that in our guide in the first place.\n\nClarke Jeffries\n\nVP and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nAll right, perfect. Thank you for taking a question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Thanks for fitting me in. I did want to follow up. Stay with verification and just this raw material investment. The thing I'm trying to reconcile is I would imagine you entered this year expecting the new platform, strong demand, needing to scale production, and therefore invest in inventory. I guess I'm wondering what changed in the quarter that warranted this updated assumption for cash flow and raw material purchase. Really, at the heart of the question, did something change about your hardware demand expectation? Not necessarily for 2024, but maybe out into 2025. We just happen to be getting that news now because of the need to update your cash from Ops forecast associated with the inventory input.\n\nJohn Waugh\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, that's a great question, Joe. I mean, the leaders of that business, I spent plenty of time with them this last quarter because they were monitoring what the demand was like for the new systems. Demand is quite strong. The key thing to highlight here is it's a one-time, multi-year purchase of inventory, raw materials. They feel very, very confident in the longevity of these systems and the longevity of that demand. They wanted to pre-purchase multi years of inventory in Q3. That was news to us, if you like. We thought that one-time thing, we wanted to include it all now in Q3 and not impact that doesn't impact next year. I mean, it'll be favorable for next year's operating cash.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay, great. Lastly, you mentioned at the start orders for Cadence.AI tripled year over year. I don't think that's possible without also getting a lift in the base business, both across EDA and SDA. I guess on an ACV run rate basis, what has the AI lineup meant for Cadence overall? Does this create a step up in value where, as you start pulling these contracts from backlog in coming quarters, it'll become more noticeable in revenue, and we'll kind of see the AI contribution more than we have to this point?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nYeah, good question. I mean, AI is adding, you know, like I was mentioning before, I mean, almost become like table stakes now. All our new contracts include our Cadence.AI portfolio as customers get more and more kind of used to using them. Once you start using the AI portfolio, it's difficult to go back to not using them. Without getting into like what happens exactly to future revenues and bookings, you know, we are always cautious about that. In general, there is uptick with more customers deploying AI, and whenever we have new contracts, you know, we are including them as it makes sense in them.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence with strong business momentum and growing opportunities with semiconductor and system customers. With a world-class employee base, we continue delivering to our innovative roadmap and working hard to delight our customers and partners. On behalf of our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."

I'm pleased to report that Cadence had a strong start to the year, delivering solid results for Q1 2024. We came in at the upper end of our guidance range on all key financial metrics, and are raising our financial outlook for the year. We exited Q1 with a better-than-expected record backlog of $6 billion, which sets us up nicely for the year and beyond. John will provide more details in a moment. Long-term trends of hyperscale computing, autonomous driving, and 5G, all turbocharged by the AI supercycle, are fueling strong, broad-based design activity.\nWe continue to execute our longstanding intelligent system design strategy as we systematically build out our portfolio to deliver differentiated, end-to-end solutions to our growing customer base. Technology leadership is foundational to Cadence, and we are excited by the momentum of our product advancement over the last few years, and the promise of our newly unveiled products. Generative AI is reshaping the entire chip and system development process, and our Cadence.ai portfolio provides cus4tomers with the most comprehensive and impactful solutions for chip-to-systems intelligent design acceleration.\nBuilt upon AI-enhanced core design engines, our gen AI solution, boosted by foundational LLM copilots, is delivering unparalleled productivity, quality of result, and time-to-market benefit for our customers. Last week at CadenceLIVE Silicon Valley, several customers, including Intel, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Juniper, and Arm, shared their remarkable successes with solutions in our Cadence.ai portfolio. Last week, we launched our third-generation Dynamic Duo, the Palladium Z3 emulation and Protium X3 prototyping platforms, to address the insatiable demand for higher performance and increased capacity hardware-accelerated verification solutions.\nBuilding upon the successes of the industry-leading Z2, X2 systems, this new platform set a new standard of excellence, delivering more than twice the capacity and 50% higher performance per rack than the previous generation. Palladium Z3 is powered by our next-generation custom processor and was designed with Cadence AI tools and IP. The Z3 system is future-proofed with its massive 48 billion gate capacity, enabling emulation of the industry's largest design for the next several generations. The Z3, X3 systems have been deployed at select customers and were endorsed by NVIDIA, Arm, and AMD at launch.\nWe also introduced the Cadence Reality Digital Twin Platform, which virtualizes the entire data center and uses AI, high-performance computing, and physics-based simulation to significantly improve data center energy efficiency by up to 30%. Additionally, Cadence's cloud-native molecular design platform, Orion, will be supercharged with NVIDIA's BioNemo and NVIDIA microservices for drug discovery to broaden therapeutic design capabilities and shorten time to trusted results. In Q1, we expanded our footprint at several top-tier customers, and furthered our relationship with key ecosystem partners.\nWe deepened our partnership with IBM across our core EDA and systems portfolio, including a broad proliferation of our digital, analog, and verification software, and expansion of our 3D IC packaging and system analysis solutions. We strengthen our collaboration with GlobalFoundries through a significant expansion of our EDA and system solutions that will enable GF to develop key digital, analog, RF, mmWave, and silicon photonics design for aerospace and defense, IoT, and automotive end markets. We announced a collaboration with Arm to develop a chiplet-based reference design and software development platform to accelerate software-defined vehicle innovation.\nWe also further extended our strategic partnership with Dassault Systèmes, integrating our AI-driven PCB solutions with Dassault's 3D Experience Works portfolio, enabling up to a 5x reduction in design turnaround time for SolidWorks customers. Now, let's talk about our key highlights for Q1. Increasing system complexity, and growing hyper-convergence between the electrical, mechanical, and physical domains, is driving the need for tightly integrated core design and analysis solutions.\nOur system design and analysis business delivered steady growth as our AI-driven design optimization platforms, integrated with our physics-based analysis solutions, continued delivering superior results across multiple end markets. Over the past six years, we have methodically built out our system analysis portfolio, and with the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire BETA CAE, are now extending it to structural analysis, thereby unlocking a multi-billion dollar TAM opportunity.\nBETA CAE's leading solutions have a particularly strong footprint in the automotive and aerospace verticals, including at customers such as Stellantis, General Motors, Renault, and Lockheed Martin. Our Millennium supercomputing platform, delivering phenomenal performance and scalability for high-fidelity simulation, is ramping up nicely. In Q1, a leading automaker expanded its production deployment of Millennium to multiple groups after a successful early access program in which it realized tremendous performance benefits.\nAllegro X continued its momentum and is now deployed at well over 300 customers, while Allegro X AI, the industry's first fully automated PCB design engine, is enabling customers to realize significant 4x to 10x productivity gains. Samsung used Celsius Studio to uncover early design and analysis insights to precise and rapid thermal simulations for 2.5D and 3D packages, attaining up to a 30% improvement in product development time. A leading Asian mobile chip company used Optimality Intelligent System Explorer AI technology and Clarity 3D Solver, obtaining more than 20x design productivity improvement.\nEver-increasing complexities in the system verification and software bring-up continue to propel the demand of our functional verification products, with hardware-accelerated verification now a must-have part of the customer design flow. On the heels of a record year, our hardware products continue to proliferate at existing customers while also gaining some notable competitive wins, including at a leading networking company and at a major automotive semiconductor supplier. Demand for hardware was broad-based, with particular strength seen at hyperscalers, and over 85% of the orders during the quarter included both platforms. Our Verisium platform that leverages big data and AI to optimize verification workloads, boost coverage, and accelerate root cause analysis of bugs saw accelerating customer adoption.\nAt CadenceLIVE Silicon Valley, Qualcomm said that they used Verisium SIM AI to increase total design coverage automatically while getting up to a 20x reduction in verification workload runtime. Our digital IC business had another solid quarter as our digital full flow continued to proliferate at the most advanced nodes. We had strong growth at hyperscalers, and over 50 customers have deployed our digital solutions on 3 nanometer and below design.\nCadence Cerebrus, which leverages gen AI to intelligently optimize the digital full flow in a fully automatic manner, now has been used in well over 350 tape-outs. Delivering best-in-class PPA and productivity benefits, it's fast becoming an integral part of the design flow at marquee customers, as well as in deep TCO flows for new process nodes at multiple foundries. In custom IC business, Virtuoso Studio, delivering AI-powered layout automation and optimization, continued ramply strongly, and 18 of the top 20 semis have migrated to this new release in its first year. Our IP business continued to benefit from market opportunities offered by AI and multi-chiplet-based architecture.\nWe are seeing strong momentum in interface IPs that are essential to AI use cases, especially HBM, DDR, UCIe, and PCIe at leading edge nodes. In Q1, we partnered with Intel Foundry to provide design software and leading IP solutions at multiple Intel advanced nodes. Our Tensilica business reached a major milestone of 200 software partners in the Hi-Fi ecosystem, the de facto standard for automotive infotainment and home entertainment. We extended our partnership with one of the top hyperscalers in its custom silicon SoC design with our Xtensa NX controller.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our Q1 results and the continuing momentum of our business. Spiraling chip and system design complexity, and the tremendous potential of AI-driven automation, offer massive opportunities for our computational software to help customers realize these benefits. In addition to our strong business results, I'm proud of our high-performance, inclusive culture, and thrilled that Cadence was named by Fortune and Great Place to Work as one of 2024's 100 best companies to work for, ranking number nine. Now, I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q1 results and our updated 2024 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered strong results for the first quarter of 2024. First quarter bookings were a record for Q1, and we achieved record Q1 backlog of approximately $6 billion. A good start to the year, coupled with some impressive new product launches, sets us up for strong growth momentum in the second half of 2024. Here are some of the financial highlights from the first quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1,009 million. GAAP operating margin was 24.8%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.8%. GAAP EPS was $0.91, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.17.\nNext, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, cash balance at quarter end was $1,012 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $650 million. Operating cash flow was $253 million. DSOs were 36 days, and we used $125 million to repurchase Cadence shares in Q1. Before I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to share some assumptions that are embedded in our outlook. Given the recent launch of our new hardware systems, we expect the shape of hardware revenue in 2024 to weigh more toward the second half as our team works to build inventory of the new system.\nOur updated outlook does not include the impact of our pending BETA CAE acquisition, and it contains the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year. Our updated outlook for fiscal 2024 is revenue in the range of $4.56 to 4.62 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 42% to 43, GAAP EPS in the range of $4.04 to 4.14, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.88 to 5.98, and operating cash flow in the range of $1.35 to 1.45 billion. We expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares.\nWith that in mind, for Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1 billion and $30 million to $1 billion and $50 million. GAAP operating margin in the range of 26.5% to 27.5. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 38.5% to 39.5. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.73 to 0.77. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.20 to 1.24. As usual, we've published a CFO commentary document on our investor relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In summary, Cadence continues to lead with innovation and is on track for a strong 2024 as we execute our intelligent system design strategy.\nI'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, Operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad now. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just to start with your outlook for the year, can you perhaps provide maybe your second-half assumption before this quarter versus where it stands today in terms of just recalibrating around delivery schedules? Maybe a good way to frame it, I think in the past you gave a share of this year's revenue that was going to come from upfront products. Is that still the right range? If it is the right range, you can obviously see more is going to end up landing in the second half. That kind of fits to your original views or how is that, I guess, skewed relative to what might have been the expectation a quarter ago?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThat's a great question, Joe. I think you've hit on the main point there. Upfront revenue is driving a lot of the quarter-over-quarter trends this year. When I look at last year, you recall that we had a large backlog of hardware orders, and we dedicated 100% of the hardware production in Q1 to deliver that hardware in Q1 2023. As a result, in Q1 2023, 20% of our Q1 2023 revenue was from upfront revenue sources. In contrast, Q1 this year, it's only 10% of the total revenue for this Q1 is coming from upfront revenue.\nAgain, last year, and to reflect on where we thought we were this time last quarter, we still expect that upfront revenue will probably be 15% to 20. I'm in and around the midpoint there is 17.5% in expectation for upfront revenue this year, and a midpoint of, say, 82.5% for recurring revenue. That's still the same as what we thought this time last quarter. That contrasts with last year was, I think, 16% of our revenue was upfront last year. To put dollar terms on it, last year, $650 million of our revenue was upfront. This year, we're expecting roughly $800 million to be upfront.\nThe first half versus first half, last year, we had $350 in the first half and $300 in the second half because we had prioritized all those shipments in hardware. It skewed the numbers toward the first half last year, so $350 and $300, ending with the $650 of upfront revenue last year. This year, it looks more like $250 and $550 at the back end. I know that's largely as a result of we had a record backlog or record bookings quarter in Q1. We've got a substantial backlog in IP that we're scaling up to deliver. A lot of that revenue falls into the second half. Also, we launched these new hardware systems last week.\nHardware revenue is expected to be more second-half weighted now because based on what we've heard, I'll chime in here on the technical aspects of those new hardware systems, we expect them to be so popular that a lot of demand will shift to those new hardware systems, and we'll have to ramp up production to be able to deliver that demand. It shifts some of the upfront revenue to the second half. I think upfront revenue is really driving a lot of the skewed metrics. Anirudh, do you want to talk about Z3?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, absolutely. We are very proud of the new systems we launched. As you know, we are a leader in hardware-based emulations with Z2, X2. Last time we launched them was in 2021. That was like a six-year cycle. Z1, X1 was 2015, and then Z2, X2 was 2021. What I'm particularly pleased about is we have a major, major refresh. It's a game-changing product, but it was also developed in only three years. In 2024, we have a new refresh, and it's a significant leap in terms of capacity. Even last week at our CadenceLIVE conference, NVIDIA and Jensen talked about how they use Z2 to design their latest chip like Blackwell.\nIt's also used by all the major silicon companies and system companies to design their chips. What is truly exciting about Z3 and X3 is it's a big leap. It's like Z3 is four or five times more capacity than Z2. It's much higher performance. It sets us up nicely for the next several years to be able to design several generations of the world's largest chips. Okay. That's the right thing to do. The reason we can do it in three years versus six years is we use our own—this is designed internally in Cadence for TSMC Advanced Node. We're using all our latest tools, all the latest AI tools. We are using all our IP.\nIt's a very good validation of our own capabilities that we can accelerate our design process, but really sets up hardware verification and overall verification flow for using the new systems. Now, as a result, normally there is a transition period when you have a new system, and we went through that twice already in the last 10 years. The customers naturally will go to the new systems, and then we build them over the next one or two quarters. That is the right thing to do for the business long term. The time it's good to accelerate the—because these AI chips are getting bigger and bigger, right?\nThe demand for emulation is getting bigger and bigger, and I can give you more stats later. We felt that it was important to accelerate the development of the next generation system to get ready for this coming AI wave for the next several years. We are very well positioned. As a result, it does have some impact on quarter to quarter, but that's well worth it in the long run.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThat's all very helpful. Thank you. Second question, I wanted to ask how some of the things you just spoke of, but also AI, start to change the frequency of customers engaging with you, how they approach renewals. You just brought up how the hardware platforms, the velocity there has improved from first generation to next six years. Now we're down to a three-year new product cycle. When I listen to your customers last week talk about AI, they're not just generating ML models that can be reused, but then, of course, each run becomes better if you're incorporating prior feedback.\nIt would just seem like AI itself not only creates stickiness, but there would be an incentive to deploy it maybe more broadly than a customer traditionally would think about deploying new products. Does that mean the average run rate of a renewal ends up becoming much bigger, and we'll start to see that flow in the backlog?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's the correct observation. As you know, what we have said before, AI has a lot of profound impact to Cadence and a lot of benefit to our customers. There are three main areas. One is the build-out of the AI infrastructure, whether it's NVIDIA or AMD or all the hyperscalers. We are fortunate to be working with all the leading AI companies. That's the first part. In that part, as they design bigger and bigger chips, because the big thing in AI systems is they have parallels, they need to be bigger and bigger chips. The tools have to be more efficient, and the hardware platform has to support that.\nThat's why the new systems. Now, the second part of AI is applying AI to our own products, which is the Cadence.ai portfolio. Like you mentioned last week, we had several customers talking about success with that portfolio, including Intel, like I mentioned, Intel, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Juniper, Arm. The results are significant. We are no longer in kind of a trial phase of whether these things will work. Now we're getting pretty significant improvements. Like we mentioned, MediaTek got like 6% power improvement. One of the hyperscale companies got 8% to 10 power improvement. These are significant numbers. It is leading to deployment of our AI portfolio.\nI think we mentioned the AI run rate on a trailing 12-month basis is up 3x. Okay. I think design process already was well automated. EDA has a history of automating design over the last 30 years. AI is in a unique position because you need the base process to be somewhat automated to apply AI. We were already well automated, and now AI can take it to the next level of automation. That's the second part of AI, which I'm pretty pleased about, is applying to our own product.\nThe third part of AI proliferation is new markets that open up, which are things like data center design with Reality that we announced, or Millennium, which is designing systems with acceleration, or digital biology. Those take a little longer to ramp up, but we have these three kind of impacts of AI. The first being direct design of AI chips and systems, second, applying AI to our own products, and third being new applications of AI.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Charles Shi with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nHi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I just want to ask about the China revenue in Q1. It looks pretty light. I just wonder whether that's part of the reason that's weighing on your Q2. I understand you mentioned that you're going through that second-gen to third-gen hardware transition right now. Maybe that's another factor. From a geographical standpoint, what's the outlook for China for the rest of the year and specifically Q2? Thanks.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, Charles. That's a great observation. If you recall, this time last year, we were talking about a very strong Q1 for China for functional verification and for upfront revenue. I think those three things are often linked. You contracted with this year. China is down at 12%. Upfront revenues is lower at 10% compared to 20%. Functional verification, of course, is lapping those really tough comps when we dedicated 100% production to deliveries. I think when you look at China, we're blessed that we have the geographical diversification that we have across our business. What we're seeing in China is strong design activity.\nWhile the percentage of revenue dropped to 12%, it pretty much goes in line with a lower hardware, lower functional verification, lower upfront revenue quarter, which would generally lead to a lower China percentage quarter. We have good diversification. While China is coming down, we could see other Asia increasing, and our customer base is really mobile. That geographical mix of revenue is based on consumption and where the products are used. As we do more upfront revenue in the second half, we'd expect the China percentage to increase.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nThanks. I want to ask another question about the upcoming ramp of the third-generation hardware. What exactly is the nature of the demand? Is it the replacement demand, like your customers replacing your Z2, X2 with the Z3, X3, or do you expect a lot more great deal of customers adopting Z3, X3? More importantly, I think you mentioned about four to five times capacity increase. They can design much larger chips with a lot more transistors. How much of an ASP uplift you're expecting from the Z3, X3 versus Z2, X2?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Charles, all good observations. Let me try to answer them one by one. In terms of your last point, normally, if the system has more capacity like this one has, it can do more. It gives more value to our customers, so we are able to get more value back. Typically, newer systems are better that way for us and better for the customers. Okay. To give you an example, I mean, these things are pretty complicated. We'll just take Z3, for example. Z3 itself, we designed this advanced TSMC chip ourselves. This is one of the biggest chips that TSMC makes. One rack will have more than 100 of these chips, and we can connect up to 16 racks together.\nIf you do that, you have thousands of full radical chips emulating. These are all liquid-cooled, connected by optical and InfiniBand interconnect. This is truly a multi-rack supercomputer. What it can do is just emulate very, very large systems very, very efficiently. Even Z2, like NVIDIA talked about it last week, even Blackwell, which is the biggest chip in the world right now with 200 billion transistors, was emulated on a few racks of Z2.\nNow with 16 racks of Z3, we can emulate chips which are like five times bigger than Blackwell, which is already the biggest chip in the world, right? That gives a lot of runway for our customers because with AI, the key thing is that the capacity of the chip needs to keep going up, not just a single chip. Look at Blackwell. They have two full radical chips on a package. As you know, you will see more and more not just big chips on a single node, but multiple chips in a package for this AI workload, and also 3D stacking of those chips. What this allows is not just emulating a single large chip, but multiple chips, which is super critical for AI. Okay.\nI think this is what I feel that this puts us in a very good position for all this AI boom that is happening, not just with our partners like NVIDIA and AMD, but also all the hyperscaler companies. Okay. That will be the primary demand: more capacity chips require more hardware. Okay. X3 will go for that with software prototyping, which is used on FPGA. We have some unique workload capabilities apart from size of these big chip systems, the capacity being much better, and performance. There are new features for low power for analog emulation that helps in the mobile market.\nWe talked about Samsung working with us, especially on this four-stage emulation, which is a new capability in emulation over the last 10 years. I think it's just a combination of new customers, a combination of competitive wins, but also continuing to lead in terms of the biggest chips in the world, which are required for AI processing now and years from now. I think the size of these chips, as you know, is only going to get bigger in the next few years. We feel that Z3, X3 is already set up for that.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Lee Simpson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, and thanks very much for squeezing me on. Just wanted to go back to what you'd said last quarter, if I could. It did seem as though you were saying that there was an element of exclusivity around your partnership with Arm, your EDA partnership around Arm Total Design. I wondered how that was developing, if indeed you're collaborating to accelerate the development of custom SoCs using Neoverse. It looks as though it's pulled in quite a lot of work, or continues to pull in quite a lot of work around functional verification.\nI guess as we look at now third-generation toolsets for Palladium and Protium, leaving aside some of the rack scale development that we're seeing out there, whether or not Arm's Total Design, I guess, development work is pulling in or is likely to pull in some of that second-half business. That means not just hyperscalers, but perhaps in AI PCs and beyond. Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question. I mean, we are proud to have a very strong partnership with Arm and with our joint customers, Arm and Cadence customers. I think we have had a very strong partnership over the last 10 years, I would like to say. It's getting better and better. Yes, we talked about our new partnership on Total Compute. Also, I think this quarter, we talked about our partnership with Arm on automotive. What is interesting to see, which of course you know this already, is that Arm continues to do well in mobile, but also now in kind of HPC, server, and automotive end markets. We are pleased with that partnership.\nThey are also doing more subsystems and higher order development. That requires more partnership with Cadence in terms of the backend, Innovus and Digital Flow, and also verification with hardware platforms and other verification tools.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Maybe just a quick follow-up. We've seen quite a bit of M&A activity from yourselves of late, including the IP House acquisition of Invicus. You've had Rambus bought. You've now acquired BETA in the computer-aided emulation space for the car. There's been quite a lot of speculation in the market about the possibility of a transformative deal being done. I guess, given that we have you on the mic here, maybe if you'd get a sense from yourself, what would be the sort of thing that a business like Cadence could look for? Would you look for a high value in a contiguous vertical to what you've already addressed, let's say, in automotive?\nWould it be something more waterfront, a business that spans several verticals, maybe being more relevant across the industrial software space? Could that be the sort of ambitions that Cadence would have given the silicon-to-systems opportunities that are emerging? Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWell, thank you for the question. A lot of times, there are a lot of reports. We normally don't comment on these reports. People get very creative on this reporting. What I would like to say is that our strategy hasn't changed. It's the same strategy from 2018. First of all, I want to make sure you know that we are focused in our core business, which is EDA and IP. Yes, I launched this whole initiative on systems, and it's super critical, chips, silicon-to-systems. One thing that I even mentioned last time, what is different from 2018 to now, is that EDA and IP is much more valuable to the industry. Our core business itself has become much more valuable because of AI.\nOur first focus is in our core business. We are leading in our core business. Our first focus is on organic development. Okay. That's what we like. We always say that's the best way forward. Along with that, we will do some—we have done, like you mentioned, some opportunistic M&A, which is usually, I would like to say, the tuck-in M&A in the past. That adds to our portfolio. It helped us in system analysis. We also did it in IP because I'm very optimistic about IP growth this year. We talked about our new partnership with Intel Foundry in Q1. We also acquired Rambus IP assets, which are HBM. HBM is, of course, a critical technology in AI.\nWe are seeing a lot of growth in HBM this year. We have booked that business. The deliveries will happen towards the second half of the year, as John was saying earlier. That's the thing. Now, in terms of BetaCAE, it made sense because it is a very good technology. It's the right size for us. We are focused on finishing that acquisition and also integrating that. That will take some time. That's our primary focus in terms of M&A. It's a very good technology. They have a very good footprint in automotive and aerospace verticals.\nJust to clarify, we have the same strategy from 2018, and that's working as well. It's primarily organic with very synergistic computational software, mostly tuck-in acquisitions.\n\nLee Simpson\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nThank you. Anirudh, I had a follow-up on the Z3, X3 commentary that you had. One of the things I was thinking about, especially as you talked about the InfiniBand low-latency network across the multiple racks of Z3, you had mentioned that you're up to 85% attach rate of both systems with Z2, X2. I would imagine that would continue to go up. If you can comment on if the new systems incorporate InfiniBand across Z3 and X3, and if so, do you expect that to be sort of a selling point for your customers that are designing these big chips, which in many cases these days have software development attached to the design process?\nDo you think that the attach rates continue to move higher for both systems?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, absolutely. I think this—I think I started this in, I forget, now 2016, I think, Dynamic Duo or 2015 and 2016, which is we have a custom processor for Palladium, and we use FPGA for Protium. Okay. This is what we call Dynamic Duo because then Palladium is best in class for chip verification and RTL design, and Protium is best in class for software bring-up, okay, with the common front end. As a result, over the years, this has become the right approach, okay? Our customers are fully embracing both these systems as they invariably do both chip development and software development. I mean, a perfect example is, of course, our long-term development partner, NVIDIA.\nI mean, NVIDIA is no longer doing just chip development. They have a massive software stack. That's true for all the hyperscalers. We see that trend continuing. We do use NVIDIA's products like InfiniBand in our systems on Z3, to your question, which is because Z3 is a very unique architecture. It requires very, very high-speed interconnect. It's almost like a supercomputer. It requires optical and InfiniBand in Z3. In X3, we are using AMD FPGAs, which are fabulous, but it does not require that tight interconnect speed. InfiniBand is more used in Z3 versus X3. X3 is a great system too. We're using the latest AMD FPGAs.\nIt has 8x higher capacity than X2, and all kinds of innovation on the software side as well. We are very pleased. I'm very confident that we have true leadership in these hardware platforms, both Palladium and Protium. We are also pleased, like I said earlier, that we are able to refresh it much sooner than the market expected, given our track record. We are seeing a lot of demand for both of these systems together going forward. Yeah.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you, Anirudh. A follow-up for John. Anirudh mentioned HBM IP business booked and shipping in second half. I was wondering if you can kind of give us a bigger picture update on how you're viewing IP in general in terms of bookings relative to sort of ramps of those IP sales. Is it sort of the entire segment, sort of a second half? Should we think about a second half ramping at a heavier weight than first half? Any update there would be helpful.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ruben. I mean, Q1 IP performance and bookings were ahead of our expectations. Everything remains on track there for a very strong growth year for 2024 for the IP business. Of course, the timing of revenue recognition depends on the timing of deliveries. We had a tremendous bookings quarter in Q1 and were preparing to scale for a number of deliveries of IP in the second half. We expect the IP to have a very strong year this year. We're pleased with the overall business momentum. We need to scale up some headcount to prepare to deliver on some of the larger backlog orders.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. One thing, that I want to highlight, I think you may have seen this. I just want to highlight our partnership with Intel and IFS, okay, that was concluded in Q1. It's really good to see Pat and Intel investing more in the foundry business and also working more closely with us. That's also a key contributor to IP. Like John said, we have to hire the people, do the—we need to port our portfolio to the Intel process, okay? That takes some time. More will come towards the end of the year and next year. We are pleased with that new partnership on IP, okay?\n\nRuben Roy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nVery helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director of Software Research, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. For you, John, first, and then Anirudh. For John, thinking back to a recent conversation we had, could you comment as a measure of EDA market health or dynamics what you're seeing or expecting in terms of intra-contract new or expansion business? This is an ongoing phenomenon in EDA. Maybe talk about what you're seeing in that kind of business beyond the customer renewals schedule. Relatedly, how are you thinking about pricing for this year, given that EDA generally has substantially better pricing capacity than you might have had in years past? My follow-up for Anirudh.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nSure. Thanks, Jay. Great question. Yeah, I think what you're getting at there is what we would call add-ons. Typically, we have the very predictable software renewal business. You'll see in the recurring revenue part of our business, I think we're at double-digit revenue growth. Over the past few years, I think that's been at low teens. We're seeing that a number of customers that have adopted AI tools are maybe not coming back and purchasing add-ons as frequently. Right now, we're focused on proliferating those AI tools into accounts. I think there's an opportunity to increase pricing there, but maybe now is not the right time.\nWe have such strong momentum on the upfront revenue business. We're preparing for scale into the second half there. We'll have plenty of revenue growth in the second half of the year. We can continue to focus on proliferating our AI tools and technology into accounts. Pricing is something certainly we can focus on more intently in future years. Right now, the focus is on proliferation. Anirudh, do you have anything to add to that? No. No.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director of Software Research, Griffin Securities\n\nYeah. Okay. Anirudh, thinking back to your conference last week, particularly the GenAI track, it was interesting, of course, to hear the adoption presentations by Renesas, Intel, and so forth. What seemed to be taking place is a heavy focus on Cerebrus, which makes sense. It's the one longest in market. Perhaps you could talk about how you're thinking about the adoption curve for the other brands aside from Cerebrus. Are there any critical parts of the design flow that might not necessarily be amenable to AI enablement? We hear a lot about implementation, analog verification, but we don't hear a lot about AIs being applicable to synthesis, for example.\nMaybe talk about those areas where it makes a lot of sense and those where perhaps it will remain more or less conventional technology.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jay, for the question. As you know, we have five major AI platforms, with Cerebrus and Digital Implementation being the one that has been out the longest. Cerebrus is doing quite well, like you noted. We also commented on more than 350 tape outs, a lot of PPA improvement. All the other ones are doing well too. Sometimes we have too many products. We don't talk enough about the others. Verification, like Verisium, is doing quite well. I mentioned Qualcomm last week, talked about pretty impressive results. Because verification, as you know, is an exponential problem. As the chips get bigger, the verification task gets exponentially bigger.\nThe benefit of AI can be significant in verification. I think you will see that in the next few quarters and years, verification will be as important as implementation in terms of benefits of AI. Okay. The other area I would like to highlight is PCB and Allegro and packaging. That area hasn't seen that much automation in PCB. Allegro is a leading platform for packaging and PCB, but we're really proud of Allegro X AI. We talked about several customers, including Intel, last week talked about 4x to 10x improvement using X AI in PCB. Apart from digital, I think the next two ones I feel are verification, and Allegro and PCB.\nThe areas that haven't done as well, I mean, is more not in design optimization, is design generation. I think these LLM-based models do provide a lot of promise. Historically, we haven't done as much design generation, which is almost pre-RTL, right? Going from spec to RTL, that's truly the creative part of the design process. Once you have RTL, it's more optimization part in digital and verification. I think that's where we have to see. Some initial results, which we haven't talked, I think mentioned last week, we work with a—we have to see. It's still in early phases.\nWe work with one or two customers in which we took a 40, 50-page spec document, this English document, and were able to automatically generate RTL from it. Okay. The RTL quality is pretty good. Again, we have to see how that goes. That requires these really advanced LLM capabilities. That's something to be seen. If that works well, that could be another kind of very interesting kind of application of GenAI.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director of Software Research, Griffin Securities\n\nOkay. Very good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. John, I appreciate the fact that China revenue in the first quarter was down against a tough year-ago comp on the hardware verification side as you worked down backlog. I assume that you still expect China to be diluted to overall company growth in the fiscal year. Could you speak to whether or not you're starting to see US export controls begin to impact your ability to do business there, whether that be a function of restrictions around Gate All Around or certain China customers added to the entity list?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, Gary. Thanks for the question. Just to clarify, I think last quarter, I said I expected China revenue to be flat to down this year. I think we still expect that, and that's because last year was such a strong year. There was kind of an oversized portion of that hardware catch-up that we had that was delivered to China. I think it skewed the China number higher last year. We're lapping pretty tough comps. Design activity in China remains very strong, though. We have a lot of diversification. There's strength in other parts of the world. We're very comfortable with the 2024 outlook.\nWe factored all the impact of geopolitical risk in there to the best we can and try to de-risk China as much as we can in our guide.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay. The follow-up I wanted to ask about bookings trends for the balance of the year. You obviously highlighted better than seasonal Q1 booking trends. How would you expect the bookings to play out for the balance of the year? To what extent will Z3 and X3 factor into that for the balance of the year? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I mean, it's hard to predict in terms of Z3 and X3, but we definitely need another quarter to see that. I mean, we expect strong demand, and we expect strong revenue growth into the—we're preparing for scale into the second half on the hardware side. We need to at least see another quarter of demand. Normally with hardware, I don't like taking up the year for hardware until I see the pipeline in the summer. We're trying to be conservative there. Generally, on the hardware side, yeah, we're basically preparing for scale. We're trying to build—we'll build those systems as quickly as possible. We expect strong demand there.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Celino\n\nSoftware Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHey, thanks for fitting me in. Anirudh, congrats to your R&D team. They've been impressive that they reduced the cycle there, all while designing that in one box too, right? Maybe first, just how many of the—so the Z3 and X3, does it become available in Q3? I guess when can customers start putting orders in for that?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. First of all, thanks. Yes, they've become available now, okay? It'll ramp in, but it will ramp Q3 and then Q4. We already have them running at several early customers. I mean, normally when we announce something, as you know, like at one of our lead partners, they have been running for three months already and very stable. In general, it will be more Q3 and then Q4 in terms of—because normally in any system, there's like a three to six-month kind of overlap. We will still sell Z2, X2, and then move to Z3, X3. That's a natural part. That's also contributing to this quarter-by-quarter variation a little bit. It will ramp, and Q3 will be bigger, and then Q4 should be bigger than that.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. We've tried to de-risk the guide with the assumption that there's going to be strong demand for the newer systems. It'll give us the opportunity to put some of the older systems into the cloud because we have a large underserved community that want to use our emulation capacity. We haven't had a lot of capacity to share with them through our cloud offering. To the extent we do that, that will lead to ratable revenue, though. I think when it's used in the cloud, you get revenue over time, whereas when we deliver and they use it on-prem, we take revenue upfront. Yeah, that's it.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThe demand is low, but it takes like one to two quarters to ramp.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes. Yeah.\n\nJason Celino\n\nSoftware Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay. That's kind of what I was going to ask next. I think last time in 2021, you had like a six-month period where you were selling both, and I think you were trying to clear inventory for the Z1 and X1. Doesn't sound like you'll be trying to do that again. When I think about this Q2 air pocket, is it a function of customers waiting for Z3, X3, or is it a function of they might not want to buy the older version?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWell, we've de-risked the guide on the assumption that many customers might wait. We intend to sell them side by side. To the extent the customers wait, it will shift some hardware revenue into the second half of the year. We've anticipated that, so that's within the guide. To the extent the customers continue to buy Z2 and we're not putting those into the cloud, but selling those outright as well, that will change the profile or the shape of revenue. We expect that this new system, the strength of this new system, will trigger a lot of demand for it.\n\nJason Celino\n\nSoftware Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you both.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you for taking my question. I think you mentioned second-half growth will be driven a lot more by hardware. Do you think you will see all the benefit of the hardware refresh within this year? Will it be done? Will it continue into 2025? I guess my bigger question really is that if I exclude the upfront benefits from last year and this year, your recurring business is expected to grow about 10%. I'm curious, Anirudh, is that in line with the kind of recurring revenue growth you are expecting or we should be expecting going forward, right, along with periodic hardware refreshes? Is that not the right way to interpret your core recurring part of your business?\n\nAnirudh Devgan",
    "content2": "President and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWell, very good question. First of all, in non-recurring, it's not just hardware, but it's also IP in terms of the second half. Because like we mentioned, we have new IP business driven by HBM, AI, and also Intel IFS. That is also backend loaded along with hardware. Hardware, normally when we launch a new system, it takes one or two years for it to fully. Even though we are not commenting about next year, I'd be surprised if this time it's only a six-month impact. I expect these things are built to be used and designed for the next five to seven years.\nThe impact will be also not just this year, but following years. In terms of recurring revenue, I think the best way, like we have said, is to look at a three-year CAGR basis because there could be some fluctuation and all. Overall, we are pleased with the recurring revenue growth, and we go from there.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Vivek, if I could, I'd like to kind of carry in some of Gary's question earlier that I don't think I addressed because he was asking about the bookings profile for the year. Q2 for software renewals, I think, is our lightest software renewals quarter for the year. I think we explained last quarter that we expect the weighting of bookings, first half to second half, to be about 40, 60 this year. The recurring revenue right now in the guide is about double digits, about 10%. In the past, it's been about 13%.\nWe're not really anticipating a huge number of add-ons to grow that above 10%. To the extent that that comes through, it'll be upside to the guys. What we try to do when we do the guide is de-risk for the risks that we can see.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you. For my follow-up question on incremental EBIT margin, do you think this greater mix of hardware is impacting the incremental EBIT margin? I think if I calculated correctly, the new guidance is still below the 50% incremental, right? Or right about, which is lower than what you have had the last two, three years. Is that the right interpretation? What can change that?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Vivek, I think what you're referring to really is that, I mean, for what, seven years in a row now, we think we've been achieving over 50% incremental margins. It's a matter of priority here. We try to achieve that every year. We'll certainly be trying to achieve that this year. I think we're in the high 40s. It's probably about 47% when you look at this guide right now. I think one of the biggest challenges with something like that is we do small-talking M&A. I don't want to go over Lee Simpson or the answer Anirudh gave to Lee Simpson, but organic is delicious here at Cadence. We focus on innovation and growing with organically driven products, and then with small-talking M&A.\nTo the extent that we do some larger M&A, of course, we have BETA CAE, which apparently is a gold standard in structural simulation. That's a big acquisition for us. Now I think the size of that probably still qualifies as a small-talking. When you do something like that, those M&A transactions typically are headwinds to that incremental margin calculation. In the short term, they'll be beneficial in the long term. In the short term, M&A can be dilutive pretty much in the first year and then become depreciative later. When we look at our incremental margin, that's a headwind. We try to overcome that headwind because normally all we do is these small-talking M&As.\nI haven't given up on 50% incremental margin for this year. It's a challenge, but we'll do our best to achieve this.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. After a strong 2023, SDA is starting the year relatively flattish and down about 5% to 6 sequentially. I think it feels like it's an unusual starting point for SDA, especially given all of the drivers that you guys have articulated. Is SDA expected to also be more second-half loaded? Do you expect SDA—this is ex-BETA CAE—but do you expect SDA to grow in line or faster than your overall corporate growth target for the full year?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Harlan, that's a great question. Thanks for highlighting that because I had that on my list of things to say. I think there's something funny going on with the rounding on when you kind of apply the growth rates for SDA for Q1 over Q1. The actual growth rate is probably high single digits, Q1 over Q1. Now, I know that's lapping tough comps against Q1 2023. I think if you look on a two-year CAGR basis, I think it's up about 17% per annum on a two-year CAGR basis for SDA. We're expecting strong SDA growth again this year, and it'll be higher than the Cadence average. That's our expectation.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for that. Anirudh, lots of new accelerated compute AI SoC announcements just even over the past few weeks, right? We saw flagship Blackwell GPU announcement by one of your big customers, NVIDIA. We've actually seen even more announcements by your cloud and hyperscale customers bringing their own custom AI ASICs to the market, right? Google with TPU Z5, Google with their Arm-based CPU ASIC, Meta unveiled their Gen 2 TPU AI processor chips as well. In addition to that, their roadmaps seem to be accelerating.\nCan you give us an update on your systems and hyperscale customers? I mean, are you seeing the design activity accelerating within this customer base? Is the contribution mix from these customers rising above that sort of roughly 45% level going forward?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Harlan, that's a very good observation. The pace of AI innovation, like you know, is increasing, and not just in the big semi companies, but of course in these system companies. I think several announcements did come out, right? Including, I think now Meta is public that Meta is designing a lot of silicon for AI. Of course, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, all the big really hyperscaler companies, along with NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, all the other kind of Samsung has an AI phone this year. I mean, there is a lot of acceleration both on the semi side and on the system side. We are involved with all the major players there, and we're glad to provide our solutions.\nI do think—and this is the other thesis we have talked about for years now, right? Five, seven years that the system companies will do silicon because of a lot of reasons for customization, for schedule and supply chain control, for cost benefits if there is enough scale. I think the workload of AI, like if you look at, I think some of the big hyperscaler and social media companies, they're talking about using like 20,000, 24,000 GPUs to train these new models. I mean, this is an immense amount. The size of the model and the number of models increased.\nThat could go to a much, much higher number than right now that is required to train these models and, of course, to do inference on these models. I think we are still in the early innings in terms of system companies developing their own chips and at the same time working with the semi companies. I expect that to grow. Our business with those system companies doing silicon, I would like to say, is growing faster than Cadence average. The good thing is the semi guys are also doing a lot of business. I don't know if that 45% will, because that's a combination of a lot of companies. Overall, the AI and hyperscalers, they are doing a lot more, and so are the big semi companies.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll now turn it back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence as our broad portfolio and product leadership highly positions us to maximize the growing opportunities in the semiconductor and systems industry. On behalf of our employees and our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. This concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect."

Now I'll turn the call over to Anirudh.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered an outstanding Q4, wrapping up a record 2023, achieving 15% revenue growth, 42% non. GAAP operating margin and over 20% non-GAAP EPS growth for the year. We exited 2023 with a record backlog of $6 billion, as customers increasingly committed to our chip to system integrated design and analysis platforms. We expect our innovative solutions to continue driving broad-based business momentum in 2024. John will provide more details in a moment. Secular trends of digital transformation, hyperscale computing, and autonomous driving, all bolstered by an. AI super cycle continue to fuel strong. Broad based design activity. We continue successfully executing to our intelligent system design strategy that triples our TAM. Opportunity while greatly expanding our portfolio.\nOur innovative engine delivered several significant products, including most recently the revolutionary Millennium M1 Platform, the industry's first accelerated multiphysics supercomputing platform. The platform tightly integrates our Fidelity CFD Software with high performance GPUs and combines AI, HPC, and digital twin technology to deliver unprecedented 20x energy efficiency and up to 100x design impact. We were honored to have customers including. Honda, Boeing, and GE as speakers at our launch event. We substantially grew our footprint at market. Shaping customers and expanded our relationships with key ecosystem partners. We further our partnership with Intel Foundry Services through a strategic multi-year agreement. Providing design software and leading IP at multiple Intel advanced nodes, thereby advancing Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy and accelerating mutual customer success.\nCadence is at the forefront of the AI revolution, closely partnering with marquee companies on their trailblazing AI design for training and Inference from cloud to the edge. NVIDIA and Cadence have collaborated closely over. Several years and in Q4 we deepened our partnership through a meaningful expansion of our hardware solutions and EDA software. Earlier in the quarter we announced our. Work on Cadence AI with NVIDIA's NeMo Retriever, and now we are thrilled to deepen our partnership and extend it to the new Millennium multiphysics supercomputer and SaaS solution, which is co-optimized with NVIDIA's. Accelerated Computing and AI platform, and as. The exclusive EDA partner of Arm Total Design. Cadence and Arm are closely collaborating to. Accelerate the development of custom SoCs based on the Neoverse Compute Subsystem. Over the year, we have continued building. Out our Generative Cadence AI Portfolio, the industry's broadest AI offering spanning chip to board to system, and delivering exceptional optimization and productivity benefits.\nEarlier in Q2 we introduced Virtuoso Studio and Allegro X AI, bringing AI to custom, analog, and PCB designs, and in Q4. We added Voltus InsightAI for automatically. Addressing voltage drop violations. We also pioneered bringing LLM capabilities to. Chip design, successfully helping Renesas accelerate functional specification to final design. Accelerating momentum of our Cadence AI portfolio. Has led to an almost 10x increase. In the number of customers adopting our Gen AI solutions in 2023 as customers. Embrace the technology to develop optimized products much more efficiently.\nNow let's talk about some of the. Product highlights for Q4 and 2023. Rising system complexity and challenges stemming from the growing hyperconvergence of the electrical, mechanical. Physical worlds are driving the need for a seamless platform solution across design. Packaging, simulation, and analysis. We made this a core tenet of our intelligent system design growth strategy six years ago, and our system design and analysis business continued a strong momentum delivering 18% year over year growth in Q4 and 22% growth for the year. PCB and advanced packaging are linchpin technologies that sit at the crucial intersection of. Mechanical and electrical domains and Cadence's rich heritage in these areas remain a key strategic differentiator, especially in the emerging chiplet era. We continue advancing these technologies with Allegro x AI providing greater than 10x acceleration in PCB design and endorsed by Schneider Electric and Kioxia at its launch.\nOur multiphysics analysis portfolio couples our expertise. In physics based modeling with AI driven optimization and is delivering superior results to customers across multiple vertical segments especially aerospace and defense and automotive. Recently we launched Celsius Studio, the industry's. First complete AI thermal design and analysis solution for electronic systems delivering up to a 10x performance benefit over legacy systems. With endorsement by Samsung and BAE Systems and Wistron, a leading technical services provider, Use Optimality's AI driven optimization technology and Clarity for fast accurate electromigration in-design analysis. Improving design reliability while realizing a 2x. Improvement in turnaround time.\nOur digital IC business finished another strong. Year with 22% revenue growth in Q4. As our solutions continued gaining share at. Market shaping customers, especially at the most advanced nodes. Our digital software is proliferating in all top 20 semiconductor companies, and our digital. Full flow was adopted by 34 additional customers during the year. We are very pleased with the accelerating. Momentum of our Cadence Cerebrus GenAI solution whose transformative PPA and productivity benefits. Have led to its deployment in all. Our top 10 digital customers and used in well over 300 tape outs in Q4. Cadence Cerebrus run rate more than quadrupled at several market-shaping customers, and it also drove significant digital full flow expansions at two top-tier semi customers.\nOur Integrity 3D-IC platform is the industry's only unified 3D-IC design and analysis platform and ties our best-in-class SOC and package design technologies with system-level planning and analysis. In Q4. GUC successfully used Integrity 3D-IC to tape out a complex 3D stack die design with a wafer-on-wafer structure on an advanced FinFET node. Next, I will talk about our functional verification business, which had another remarkable year, delivering 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 and 22% growth for the full year. Escalating system and software bring up challenges, along with pressing need for first pass. Silicon success continues driving strong demand for our Functional Verification solutions. Our best-in-class Dynamic Duo of Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 platform delivered another record year. With strong momentum across AI, hyperscale, auto, and mobile.\nVirtually all of the top hyperscalers are. Palladium customers and the majority of them. Are also Dynamic Duo customers. Last month we announced a new set of Palladium Z2 applications that included the industry's first four-state emulation and mixed. Signal modeling capabilities that will significantly accelerate SOC verification. Marquee customers including NVIDIA and Samsung supported the announcement. Our hardware family added 26 new and Over 110 repeat customers during the year. With the top three deals being with. A global marquee system company, the leading AI system company, and the leading communications services company. Demand for the Duo greatly exceeded our. Expectations when more than two thirds of the orders in the year, including both platforms. Our Custom IC Virtuoso Inspector franchise solutions tackle the most complex challenges in analog, mixed-signal, RF design, and circuit simulation. Are increasingly crucial for our customers.\nBuilding on our market leadership, our custom IC revenue grew 16% year over year in Q4. Customer interest in our recently announced Virtuoso. Studio is strong with over 2,000 downloads so far, and adoption of our newer Spectre platform products continues to ramp. Virtuoso had a major win with a. Top global memory company which replaced its internal tools with our technology. Our IP business drove a strong finish to the year, growing 36% year over year in Q4. We continue to sharpen our star IP strategy with a targeted acquisition such as Rambus PHY IP and Invecas to capture. Market opportunities offered by AI and heterogeneous integration. Customer interest in the Rambus PHY assets. Especially HBM and GDDR IP have been extremely positive, which have already been instrumental in closing some strategic deals.\nOur Invecas acquisition is also highly synergistic to the strategy, adding a skilled engineering. Team with expertise in delivering custom solutions across design, product engineering, advanced packaging, and embedded software. In closing, we are pleased with our. Outstanding performance in 2023, and are excited by the business momentum and market opportunities in 2024. Now I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q4 results and our 2024 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Cadence delivered a strong Q4 and 2023, driven by growth across all of our businesses. Robust design activity and customer demand, coupled with our strong execution, helped us to achieve revenue growth of 15% and EPS growth of over 20% for the year. Fourth quarter bookings were strong, and I'm pleased that we achieved record backlog and record current remaining performance obligation levels, finishing the year with approximately $6.0 billion in backlog and approximately $3.2 billion in CRPO. Here are some of the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1,069,000,000 for the quarter and $4,090,000,000 for the year. GAAP operating margin was 31.5% for the quarter and 30.6% for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 42.9% for the quarter and 42.0% for the year.\nGAAP EPS was $1.19 for the quarter and $3.82 for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.38 for the quarter and $5.15 for the year. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, our cash balance was $1,008,000,000 at year end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $650 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $272 million and $1.35 billion for the full year. DSOs were 43 days, and we used $700 million to repurchase Cadence shares during the year. Before I provide our outlook for Q1 and 2024, I'd like to share some assumptions that are embedded in our outlook. In 2023, our upfront revenue mix increased to approximately 16%, largely due to strong hardware demand.\nIn 2024, we expect another record hardware revenue year and strong IP growth, and as a result, at the midpoint, our outlook assumes that our upfront revenue mix for the year will increase to approximately 17.5%. In Q1 2023, our upfront revenue mix was approximately 20%, largely due to our effort to improve hardware delivery lead times at the start of last year. In Q1 2024, at the midpoint, our outlook assumes an upfront revenue mix of approximately 14%. Our non-GAAP EPS outlook is based on a tax rate of 16.5%. Finally, our outlook for Q1 and 2024 is based on our usual assumption that export control regulations in place today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year.\nIn our outlook for 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $4.55 to 4.61 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 32% to 33, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 42% to 43, GAAP EPS in the range of $4.08 to 4.18, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.87 to 5.97, operating cash flow in the range of $1.35 to 1.45 billion, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2024. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $990 million to 1.01 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 24.5% to 25.5, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 36.5% to 37.5, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.74 to 0.78, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to 1.14.\nAs usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our investor relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, I am pleased that for 2023 we achieved revenue growth of 15% and EPS growth of over 20%. We achieved the seventh consecutive year of over 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margins, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 42%, and we finished the year with record backlog and CRPO, setting ourselves up for a great 2024. As always, I'd like to thank our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support, and with that, operator, we. will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Now we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Jason Seidenberg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Seidenberg\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHey guys, happy Monday. Maybe my first question on the backlog strength, you know, really impressive especially given the hard year over year compared to John or Anirudh. What drove the strength here? It sounds like it's hardware related or maybe it's broad based. Anything helpful?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nJason? Yes, it was very broad based, broad based across geographies and broad based. Across all of the businesses. Actually, on the hardware front, you might recall this time last year we finished with over six months of backlog for hardware. We addressed those lead times at the start of the year, and now we're down to a more normal eight weeks of hardware backlog. When you compare the backlog at the end of 2023 against the end of 2022, I think it reflects strong bookings, broad-based bookings across all geographies, across all businesses. On the hardware side, slightly less hardware, or maybe less hardware, certainly in backlog at the end of 2023 versus the end of 2022.\n\nJason Seidenberg\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay. And then, you know, when we think about 2024 as a whole, is it a big renewal year or I guess how, how does 2024 look compared to other years, particular 23 when you think about renewal timing and things like that. Thanks.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, great question, Jason, that your last year was kind of very heavily weighted towards the second half of renewals. We don't expect it to be that heavily weighted in the second half this year. Looking at software renewals and when they come due, if you look at the annual value, it's probably weighted 40% first half to 60% second half.\n\nJason Seidenberg\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Charles Shi with Needham. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham\n\nHi, good afternoon. I just pop up the mind of many investors. Can you guys provide any thoughts on the Synopsys and Ansys merger or whatever you call it? Especially now, Cadence probably needs to execute on that intelligent system design strategy more in an organic way than in organic way. Any thoughts would be great. Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Hi, Charles, this is Anirudh. So as you know, we have been executing on our intelligent system design strategy. For six years now. We started this in 2018 and we know for a while that there will be this convergence of electrical and mechanical domains, this convergence of system and semi companies, semi companies becoming system companies and system companies doing silicon, as you all know. And now we have commented that about. 45% of our, you know, business is coming from system companies. But this is not. I mean, we have been executed on. This from 2018 and focusing on of. Course our core business, which is EDA expanding into SDNA, which what we call. System design analysis and of course AI over the last five, six years.\nAnd if you look at our results on SDNA, you know, even in 2023. Our business, our revenue is up 22%. In SDNA, and it has been up. More than 20% for the last several years, whereas that market is not really growing at that rate. So we are gaining a lot of share in SDNA and this is primarily due to our products and our customer response. So the customers have really embraced our. Strategy and embraced our product differentiation. We first started with finite element, with Clarity, and that is benchmarking very well, winning a lot of share, a lot of customers. Recently, you must have seen our new product in CFD CFD is a big market.\nThere are two big simulation areas in SDNA. One is finite element, which we are already ahead in, and the other is CFD With Millennium, this is one of the most revolutionary products in CFD in the last 30 years. I can tell you more about Millennium later. The third thing in our SDA strategy is we are the only company that has a very strong position in packaging and PCB, which is critical for chiplets and 3D-IC. So overall I feel very confident in. Terms of our market position. The strategy we have implemented for six years and I see a lot of growth and momentum going forward. Yeah.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham\n\nThanks Daniel. Maybe a follow up. I do want to dig a little. Bit into your digital IC design and the sign of revenue you reported last quarter. I think it's exceeding $300 million when you have been bumping along 250 since I think early part of 2022. But then it does seem to show some really good strength since second half 23 you talked about the share gains and I do understand this is the part where you have the most overlap with your direct competitor Synopsys and just really curious, how sustainable is the strength you saw in Q4 and is there any color you can provide us? What's driving the revenue upside for that business in fourth quarter? How should people think about the sustainability of that? Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, hi Charles, that's a good question. On digital, I mean there are multiple reasons driving that, but I would say the main reason and we had good growth in Q4 as you saw in our digital business. Of course the main reason that's driving that is the AI super cycle. So there's a lot more design activity. You will notice some of our key partners increasing the Cadence of their major. Kind of product development. So there's AI in AI we participate in several ways. One is just the build out of the AI infrastructure, which is of course a great partnership with NVIDIA and all the other hyperscalers.\nAnd then also our AI enabled products. Like Cerebrus and Optimality and overall AI portfolio. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Cerebrus, which is the flagship product. For digital implementation using AI, our business went to 4x, so that's also providing a lot of growth in terms of. There's one, there's overall much more design activity, especially at the most advanced node and then AI products provide acceleration. On top of that. The other thing that I had mentioned before, but as people use Cerebrus, which is the overall AI product and Digital implementation. It also has a pull through of the full flow. Not just place and route, but also synthesis and sign-off.\nWhat I'm very pleased to see is one AI products like Cerebrus are doing well, but they're also pulling through synthesis. Our position has improved dramatically in synthesis in the last one year and also a lot of sign-off engagement. Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the technology progress, the AI progress, and also engagement with some big customers that traditionally were not using Cadence. Now like we mentioned, all Top. 20 customers are using Cadence solutions in digital. So we'll see how it progresses. I think it's good progress on digital and I expect that to continue.\nCharles, I would just add to that that in Q4, we saw some very good cash collections from customers that were kind of lower creditworthy customers that we didn't think we would collect was that cash. So it wasn't in our forecast. So we had some upside from that. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. I actually had a question on growth. Just kind of first on the segment side, IP growth has been more modest. Than the entire company growth. So I was hoping if you could give us some color on that. But then Anirudh, my bigger question is. That when I look at the overall sales growth for Cadence, so 19% in 22, then 15% last year and now 12% is what you're guiding to for this year. I mean these are impressive growth rates versus the semiconductor industry. But still it shows a deceleration, right? For the last few years, which is very different than the acceleration that we see for a lot of other semiconductor companies that are exposed to the AI and generative AI team.\nSo what is the right way to interpret this deceleration in your sales? Like should we be expecting acceleration back. At some point as some of these. AI initiatives get bigger? Or what is the right way to interpret and compare your growth rate versus the acceleration of growth and a number of the AI names.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, very good question. So first on the IP part, you know, like in 23, I think first. Three quarters we had, you know, the. Growth was much more challenged is primarily. You know, with the compare the previous. Year, but as any. And some of the macro uncertainties. But as you can see in, in Q4 we had very strong growth in IP, you know, more than 30% growth in IP. And also this whole AI super cycle, as you know, is driving much more disaggregation. Right. So the 3D-IC is, is concentrated at HPC and AI application and that requires more IP, you know like UCIe or SerDes IP and then HBM and memory IP and that's why we acquired assets of the PHY assets of Rambus and overall our own portfolio in UCIe and DDR and all is doing pretty well.\nAnd then we did several acquisition to. Improve our talent in IP. So overall I do think because of AI, because of our own actions that IP should do much better in 24. You know, that's our current modeling and 23 had some, you know, you know. Unusual challenges like I mentioned. But going forward, you know, IP business should improve and, and we have focused on profitability over the last few years. In our IP business and I think. I'm pleased to say that the profitability levels are, we are, we are happy with now. Okay, so now I think we can, you know, focus more on growth and expanding our portfolio.\nAnd you may have also seen that. You know, there's all these other activity at most advanced nodes and you know, more foundries. And we're also pleased with our partnership. With Intel, Intel Foundry that we just announced today and also all the other major foundries. But we are very glad to do much more with IFS and that should also help our IP business going forward.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nAnd Vivek, I'd just like to add, I mean you asked about how to look at the revenue growth. We tend to look over a three year CAGR because most of our customers are on three year baseline contracts on the software side. And if you look at since 2017 our 3 year CAGR has been accelerating and it continues to accelerate. In 2022 we hit 15%. We actually exceeded 15% on a three year CAGR basis for last year we're very, very pleased that we were over 15% again. And then at the midpoint of the guide for 24 the three year CAGR is about 15.3%.\nSo that would be three consecutive years of over 15% revenue growth on a three year CAGR basis. Now from time to time you can get some lumpiness in things like hardware timing or IP timing and that can distort individual quarters or individual years. But we do think looking over a three year CAGR basis is probably the. Best way to look at it. That's how we look at it ourselves.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nAnd for my follow up, maybe John. One or two clarifications, what's the assumption for China contribution in 24 and then the incremental EBIT? I think from the guidance it seems like it's below 50%. Right. It's still impressive, but it is below. What we have been used to the last few years. If you could clarify that, that'll be very helpful also. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, sure. Great. Questions again, Vivek, on the incremental margin front, we typically don't start the year in the initial guide with over 50%. We tend to start lower than that and we build towards greater than 50% with growth through the year. As you know, we always like to under promise and over deliver. And if you look at our incremental margin over the last few years, that it was slightly lower in 2023 compared to previous years. And that's because on the organic side we had incremental margins north of 55%, but we did some acquisitions and typically when you have an acquisition, it can be dilutive in the and in the early year or two. And that's a bit of a headwind for incremental margins\nin relation to China. Glad you asked me about that. But China, the last four years for China, China's contributed 15% of our 2020 revenue, then followed that with 13% of 21, 15% in 22 and 17% in 23. Now, last year, I think China benefited from that large hardware backlog that we had. There was kind of an outsized portion of that backlog was for the China region. So it was a boon year last year for China. I wouldn't expect to repeat that this year. In fact, our guide, we'd expect China to be flat or slightly down. So we've kind of de risked China into the 14 to 15% range for this year, which would be consistent with the previous three years.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. Let me apologize in advance for the background noise. I wanted to ask about the disconnect between record levels of CRPO and what is assumed in your revenue outlook and as well your higher outlook for upfront revenue. And so you know why the assumption that less of that CRPO translates into revenue in fiscal year 24, especially considering the higher mix of upfront.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Gary, good questions in terms of CRPO and the relationship between CRPO and this year's revenue. But if you recall, last year we had over six months of hardware backlog in CRPO at the end of 2022. So a large portion of our hardware revenue in 23 came out of backlog at the end of 22. We ramped up production capacity and we're back to more normal levels of about eight weeks lead time now for deliveries on hardware, which is really, really important for customers. Customers want to be able to, you know, purchase the hardware and feel like they're going to get delivery of that hardware within within a year. So.\nSo typically your revenue and hardware is more correlated to your production capacity than it is to what's coming out of backlog versus versus what's coming out of new business in the year. And as a result of addressing those hardware lead times, the the revenue profile for this year takes a slightly different shape to 2023. In 2023 in Q1 we had a lot of hardware coming out of backlog. In 2024 we expect another record hardware revenue year. And the business is planning to build more hardware each quarter throughout 2024 to meet that demand. But there's kind of more of I guess hardware revenue is expected to grow quarter over quarter this year. Whereas last year Q1 was our biggest hardware quarter.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nJust to be clear John, CRPO does not include hardware backlog, but RPO does.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nOh, CRPO would include hardware. I mean even when you have over six months hardware delivery lead time, it would all be expected to revenue in a year. So that's although it's in your backlog, it's also all in your crpo. So CRPO last year would have had a lot more hardware in it than CRPO this year certainly on the product revenue side.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right. And I wanted to circle back Anirudh on a metric you gave in your prepared remarks. That is a quadrupling of the Cerebrus run rate at several market shaping customers. So should we take that to mean the annual contract value for those who took Cerebrus at market shaping customers quadrupled or maybe if you just clarify that. If I'm missing that.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Hi Gary. So. Yeah, I think Cerebra is doing very well. You know it's deployed at all the top 10 customers and actually even AI in general we mentioned number of customers engagements are up like 10x in the last 12 months. And so Cerebrus, you know, run rate. As we have mentioned before, the Cerebrus business first the customers, you know will. Try some and then they will adopt more. So I think is what, what's good. To see in Q4 is at what people were, you know, what the customers were doing and then they have their adopted that at a much bigger rate. So we are happy to see that.\nI think there is still room to go in that like we have always mentioned that we Think it will take two contract cycles and we are like, that's six years. And we are like two years into it or two or three years into it. But that's good in our model, right? We want consistent growth going forward. But yes, the uptick in Cerebrus is very promising. And then the other products came a little after Cerebrus, like Verisium or Allegro X AI or Virtuoso Studio or Optimality. And they're also seeing good progression.\nSo overall, in terms of AI, what I'm very happy about is I mentioned this before also in the last call. We have three big ways to benefit from AI, and this is true for any kind of new technologies. There are a lot of comparisons to AI, but if you compare it to the Internet, you know, the first phase is the infrastructure development. Okay, so and this are, you know. This our marquee partnership with NVIDIA, which we have had for more than a decade. And we talked about it today, you. know, with developing AI products with them, you know, them developing their own chips, you know, Palladium. We are a development partner with NVIDIA. In Palladium for more than a decade. And that also puts Palladium in a. Very strong position with all the other kind of AI developments. So that's the first phase of AI. Benefit, which is more the infrastructure.\nAnd then the second phase is like. What you asked, which is our own products. It started with Cerebrus in digital side, but now we have five major kind of copilot platforms in all the five businesses. And those are progressing pretty well, moving from initial deployments to more wider deployments. That's the second phase of AI deployments in which AI will be adopted. Into existing products like chip design and system design. One thing I want to point. Out is there's a lot of talk of what is a good application for AI. I believe one of the best applications. For AI is chip design, is because over the last 30 years we have done so much work in automatic chip design. We have a language like RTL, we have all kinds of optimization. We are built in.\nSo the chip process is already very automated. So it's an ideal thing to apply. AI on top of it, you know, for chip and system design, which is what we are seeing. And then the third phase of AI is new products that it will enable. And I have believed for several years. And that's why the investment in OpenAI, the OpenAI, the biggest new market that AI will enable will be life sciences. Okay. And biosimulation and bio life Sciences. And I think you will see that, you know, years going forward. So there are these three phases of our activity. One is AI infrastructure, two is applying AI to our own products for chip and system design. And third is AI in bio and life sciences. So overall I'm very pleased, very confident. In our positioning in AI and the results we are delivering.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThanks for the detail.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Anirudh, you noted the large number of. New products you've introduced just in the last year. Virtuoso Studio, Optimality, Allegro X and so forth. And then of course Millennium just a couple of weeks ago. Could you talk about how you're thinking about the contribution of those incrementally collectively. This year as part of your guidance. And perhaps even rank the ones that. You think might be most incremental to your revenue growth this year over and Above the pre existing products such as Innovus and the sign off products. Then I follow up.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, hi Jay, good question. I mean as you know we are a very innovative company and we have done that for years now and we invest one of the highest percentages of R&D of revenue into R&D. And then it's good to have all. These new products in multiple areas. You know, of course the three big areas being like EDA, SDA and AI. But we don't try to like, you. Know, rank our children. You know, we want all of them to do well. And it's also difficult to predict, you know, how it will because these are all for the long run. Right. So there is of course a lot of momentum with, with the AI products.\nThere's a lot of momentum with 3D-IC and Chiplet. As you know, there's Millennium I'm super excited about. I think this is the biggest innovation in CFD in the last 30 years. And I talked about the three layer. Cake, right, which is AI orchestration at the top layer, physical simulation, physics based modeling at the middle layer and then accelerate compute at the bottom layer. And you know, CFD needed to be. Disrupted in that context. Right. So we have a, you know, and We didn't talk about it much when we made the acquisition about, you know. Two years ago is this acquisition from Stanford Cascade which is very, very high fidelity, very accuracy CFD. So we had that at the heart of it and then AI on top. And then actual compute at the bottom together with, you know, NVIDIA.\nAnd this completely changes the game in. CFD for the first time we are able to simulate entire cars and planes in few hours. It's almost emulation for systems that has. Never been possible before. So there is a lot of potential in Millennium. Now because Millennium is a new product, we are offering both cloud and on prem. Palladium is mostly, as you know, on our chip business. Palladium is mostly on prem, but Millennium is both in CFD and right now most of the customers are choosing the cloud version, which is great. It's more ratable. Okay, so then Millennium and then, you know, you must have seen today we have this great partnership with Dassault SystÃ¨mest.\nActually, I'm also pretty happy about that. You know, Dassault SystÃ¨mes is a leader in, you know, PLM and MCAD and overall partnership. We have, you know, broadening partnership with Dassault SystÃ¨mes and then we talked about our IP business, how that can grow. And this new partnership with Intel and IFS and hardware continues to do well. So I think it's good to have multiple engines contributing to the growth. And then we always focus on margin at the same time. So we are well positioned going forward. But it's difficult to predict which one will do better than the others. And we don't guide on a product basis anyway.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nSo that's a good segue to my follow up. And since you mentioned so Cadence is actually quite visible here at the conference today. And so my question is, when you. Think about your ISD strategy generally and Perhaps CFD specifically. Could you talk about the kind of resources and investments you're. Having to make to effectuate that strategy. Beyond or over and above the core EDA strategy? And what do you know now about those markets that you might not have known three, four or five years ago when you were much earlier in developing the strategy?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Jay, that's a good question. I mean, one thing to point out. You know, our SDA business is about, in 2023, is about 12% of revenue. So it's already at a good pace. And also it has enough scale now to apply significant of R&D. To that space and also simulation space. We know simulation space pretty well. And. There is a lot of high R&D Synergy from our EDA R&D to SDNA R&D. So I'm pretty happy with how much R&D we have invested and we'll continue to invest there. But at the same time it is also very profitable.\nOkay. Which is, you know, our model always. Right. It's not just revenue growth, but also profitability. It, you know, which we, you. No, when you asked me what, you know, we thought it should be more profitable when we started six years ago because simulation is more profitable in EDA. So that's what is playing out in SDA. So it is pretty profitable. You know, it has played out roughly to the extent I thought it would. You know, you know, simulation always is accuracy first and then performance and capacity. The market is always looking for new simulators, new. That's how it has played out in electromagnetic and then in CFD\nNow I'm much more confident with this disruption, this massive disruption with Millennium and the key thing with Dassault SystÃ¨mes. We have mentioned this before, you. Now, as we, you know, I'm very confident in our DNA. You know, you can see in terms of product synergy, product differentiation, but we have always said that we are a computational software company. So that also means what we will not do, right? Typically things in the system space. Which are not as computational are things like PLM, things like, you know, implementation, MCAD, mechanical CAD platforms. Dassault SystÃ¨mes is the clear leader in those. You know, they are great in PLM. They are great in, you know, with SolidWorks in CATIA and the high end. So it's a perfect partner for Cadence as we focus on computational software and EDA and SDA packaging and PCB to partner with Dassault SystÃ¨mes Systèmes. We're glad to see that expansion that was announced today.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you, Anirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question your back to your IP business. It was up for 5 percentage points. Last year and I know that it. Was a relatively tough comp relative to 2022, but I would have thought that. The growth in IP would have been. Closer to your overall growth just, you know, given that higher chip design complexity does motivate your customers to license more IP in order to drive efficiencies in their chip design cycle time. So was there some customer push off of IP into this year just maybe given timing of customer programs or was. There some other dynamic that planned in. Relative to your outlook for 12% total growth this year, how do you think your IP business does this year?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, good question. I think the the shape of the IP revenue last year was little atypical. I mean I think the two reasons were because last in 2023 we had very, very strong Q4 but first three quarters were not strong at all. So overall year is in the single digits like you mentioned, but very strong Q4. So I think there are a Couple of reasons for that. One is that there were some tough. Compares from 22 to 23 in IP, especially in the beginning of the year. And then like we mentioned, you know, of course last couple of years the macro environment has been tough though it is improving now and then IP typically gets affected more than others in terms of a tough macro semiconductor environment.\nSo as a combination of that, I think the first three quarters were more challenging. But Q4 and then going into this year I am pretty cautiously optimistic about IP. You know, one, our portfolio is better, is broader and then this whole AI super cycle. Like I mentioned and then new engagements we have like with IFS and other companies. So overall I feel better about 24. John, you want to comment about the.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, of course, Harlan. As you know, we always focus on profitable and scalable revenue growth and the IP revenue contributes largely to our upfront revenue percentage. But last year for 2023 our upfront revenue percentage increased from 15% to 16%. That was on the back of a strong record hardware year. But as you say, IP revenue growth was quite, quite low in comparison to prior years. This year we're expecting the 16% to go to 17 and a half percent. That's because we expect both of those to contribute significantly to improvement in upfront revenue this year.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nAnd then we expect the IP growth. To be higher than Cadence average this year. We'll see how it plays out.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Yeah, yeah, perfect. No, thank you for that. And then good to see the strong. Outperformance on the SDA business. Right up 22% last year, certainly outgrowing. The overall market and your peers in that segment. The recent Millennium M1 supercomputer. I think it's a great example of the synergies between your chip design portfolio, your SDA portfolio. Right. You're basically taking the success you've had in hardware based verification and emulation, sort of bringing that same concept to your SDA portfolio. It seems like there would be a. Lot of untapped demand for hardware acceleration within your SDA customer base. Like how big is this market opportunity for the team as you look out over the next several years?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nOh, absolutely. You know, even for 30 years, even when I was in grad school, you know, I always believed that hardware acceleration. Is a massive opportunity for EDA and SDA in general. And you see that borne out in Palladium. So we have always dreamed about hardware acceleration and that's why this three layer cake, hardware acceleration is the bottom layer and of course AI orchestration is the top layer. And a perfect example Is Palladium. Now, in Palladium and hardware emulation, what happened is if you look at overall. Function verification on the chip side first. It'S more than a $2 billion business.\nOkay. I think if you look at all the software and hardware became roughly 50% of that. So hardware assisted verification became almost 50% of chip verification. Now CFD is also a $2 billion business and it needed this hardware based acceleration along with AI. So I don't know whether it will. Play out the same way, but there's a potential of a big portion of CFD to go to hardware based acceleration. Okay. Now it will take few years. Okay. And we are clearly leading in that. And the other thing it does, hardware based acceleration or emulation for CFD is it will improve the area, it will improve the market size of CFD as well.\nYou know, like I was talking to one of these big aerospace companies and They said current CFD, you know, the. Current simulation is only done to 20% of the flight envelope. Okay. Which is unheard of in chip design. Right. In chip Design we simulate 99 point some percent of the use cases so that when the chip comes back it works. But if you look at the system domain, because the accuracy is not there, because the speed is not there, they're only covering 20% of the use cases and all of them only in software. So the potential with Millennium is one. That 20% goes to much closer to. Much higher than 50% and then a. Big portion of that can go to. Hardware assisted emulation and verification. And by the way, the same thing can repeat again.\nThis three layer cake can repeat again in bio, which is few years out. But I think right now the opportunity is there in system simulation and CFD. So I'm pretty optimistic. But it's a new use case for that market and sometimes the new use cases can take some time to deploy. So we always have to be cautious about that. But the response so far has been phenomenal. And because they were doing some of this themselves, the customers, but to have a combined solution with AI software and hardware. And you are exactly right, it mimics our success we have done on the chip side.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nInsightful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. So I know you've touched on this already, but could you run us again through the phasing of top line and margins through 2024 guidance as well as providing some more color on what is causing the lower level of revenue seasonality in your Q1 guidance given, Q1 implies 22% versus the median of 25% over the past seven years in terms of the seasonality. Can we explain this perhaps by hardware and or IP timing or is there something else? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks Gianni for the question. But yeah, on the revenue side, the, the we expect 2024 to take a slightly different shape to 2023. That's largely a function of the revenue mix by quarter. You'll recall last year in 2023 we had 20% upfront revenue in Q1 when the year ended up at 16%. But this year for Q1 we're expecting 14% in Q1 when the year is expected to be 17.5%. So clearly from that you expect that we'd expect that upfront revenue to increase quarter after quarter this year, Whereas last year Q1 was really the high watermark for upfront revenue. And then on the expense side, we've invested Heavily, we've about 1,000 extra heads this year and that's for continued innovation and we're launching new products all the time.\nBut that expense on some of the acquisitions is more front loaded for the year and as a result that's kind of feeding into lower margins for Q1 in comparison to the rest of the year. For Q2, Q3 and Q4, we'd expect margins to be similar or higher than last year. Yeah, I think that's. Those are probably the main things to get across. Yeah, that was really good.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Really helpful. And perhaps just one last follow up on commentary around expectations of operating cash flow into next year. I mean, the lower end kind of seems flat, so perhaps what are the moving levers there? And Also how can 70% of the backlog is flowing into 2024 compared to 70% to 75 in 23? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence",
    "content2": "Yeah, Gianni. Yeah, let me take the second part first and I'll come back to the cash question. So last year we had over six months of lead times for hardware delivery. Lead times. So there was a lot of last year's hardware revenue came out of backlog. The 5% shift can pretty much all be allocated to less hardware coming out of backlog for this year. Now, hardware revenue for the year will probably be more a reflection like it has been the last few years of just how much hardware we're able to produce in the year. And we expect to increase hardware production each quarter for this year to meet the demand that we're expecting. Last year the operating cash flow was, was kind of muted. It was Less than.\nAlthough we beat on all our metrics, we came in just under the midpoint of 1350, I think with 1349 for operating cash flow. But that included us investing spending a lot to ramp up on purchase advanced purchase of raw materials to build that inventory that we believe we need for hardware. This year we intend to do that again in Q1. So we've already included that in our operating cash guide. So we're investing some of that operating cash to improve gross margins by pre purchasing a bunch of raw materials that we believe we need to keep up with the demand on the hardware side. Now the other thing I wanted to highlight is that the business's forecast for hardware is again for another record hardware revenue year and for hardware demand to continue to accelerate quarter after quarter this year.\nNormally I wouldn't include some, some of their expected demand for the second half, but until I see that, you know, it's a pipeline business. So we look at lead times, we look at the pipeline kind of closer to the summer before taking up the second half of the year. So the guide does not include the full forecast from the business. I like to hedge that back in the second half until we get to the summer. I prefer to see the pipeline come through and then there is potential to take the second half higher when we see that pipeline.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's fantastic. Thank you. Very clear.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Tilton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. John, you kind of anticipated what I. Was going to ask with your last comment there. So I just want to clarify very simply is what you should we just interpret what you said is that even. This strong upfront revenue guide, which I. Think implies another year of 20% plus growth would still fall under the motto of under promise and over deliver.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, I think that's fair. That's fair. But I didn't include the full forecast. The guide would have been higher. Of course we have strong IP as well this year. I mean certainly compared to last year, IP didn't contribute a huge amount. I mean it's been great business for us, but we're much more confident going into 24 of the IP contribution to 2024 revenue. But hardware is going to be strong again. I mean, by nature we always like to kind of hold back on the second half guide for hardware until we see the pipeline around summertime. So I haven't included the full forecast from the business in the guide.\n\nJosh Tilton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSuper helpful. My follow up is. How do you see the competition maybe. Specifically in digital Changing, if at all. If Synopsys can indeed close this Ansys acquisition and fully integrate Ansys toolset into their design flow.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nWell, I don't think that will change. The competitive landscape at all. That's my assessment in digital or even in SDNA, because digital, anyway, we are competing very effectively in the marketplace and with this AI, it is pulling in a full digital, full flow position. I think your comment may be more tied to part of digital, which is like 3D-IC. But with 3D-IC we have always. Talked about there are three big portions of 3D-IC. You know, there is the actual chip implementation tools which is, I mean digital is much bigger than that, right? Digital, we have a very big business which is growing at all the top 20 customers. But 3D-IC has these three components to it.\nOne is the chip design tools. So in chip design Tools, we are. The only company that has both analog and digital chip implementation. Okay. And the second part in 3D-IC is. Package design and Cadence is the leader in package design. And that thing is still a very strong differentiation no matter what the M&A news is outside. And then the third part is the simulation tools like thermal and electromagnetics.And there we are already doing pretty well. So I'm very confident in our product positioning and competitive advantage no matter what. Happens on the M&A side. Because anyway we are competing very effectively.\nAnd then the other thing that is. Good about Cadence is we also form very strong partnership in the ecosystem. We talked about Dassault SystÃ¨mes on the SDNA side. But the other one that I want to highlight, we have a lot of news today, but one of the things I want to highlight is our partnership with Arm. Arm is also expanding into what they call total design, going into more towards silicon, more towards custom solutions. And we are the exclusive partner with Arm as they go implement that. And that really also helps our digital business. And so overall I feel pretty confident in our digital position, including 3D-IC.\n\nJosh Tilton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nYeah, thank you. Anirud, I just had a quick question, I guess to go back to the VEX question on growth rates. I understand the 3 year CAGR, it's been excellent, it's been growing and that's really nice to see. But you know, when you think about these phases of AI at this point, is it too early to start thinking about contribution from AI as you go through these renewals? I mean, can you talk about, you know, how if there is, if you're seeing an impact yet or what that. Impact is or how we should think about AI as, you know, sort of you think about the next three years or contribution to growth looking forward.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, I think AI is definitely helping us already. Like you mentioned about our AI tools by itself has gone up by 3x. And then Cerebrus more higher than that. And then also AI itself is the infrastructure part of AI, like our partnership with NVIDIA and all the hyperscalers. So overall we are pretty pleased with that. But of course, you know, we are mostly a ratable business. So these things take like multiple years to bleed in. And I think that's fine. Our model always is to have strong revenue growth and margin growth. So I think this thing will still. Take multiple years to come into the model. But that's, I think that's a good thing. It provides multiple years of growth.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nI think it's very early innings right now on the adoption. We've been focused mainly on proliferation and we're very, very pleased with the uptake of our AI tools and just how strongly they're growing. On the booking side, it is starting to feed into the PNL already. But as Anirudh says, because it's ratable, that takes time to show up in total, but very, very early innings in adoption of AI tools right now. I think there's a lot more to go.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nRight, right. Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks guys. And then just quickly, John, you talked a lot about the hardware and I think it's pretty clear at this point. But just to make sure I understand, sounds like lead times have normalized. Is that correct? And also in terms of sort of the visibility you get from your customer base, that hasn't changed. Right. Is that what you're saying in terms of, you know, kind of how far out your customers are ordering it? And I guess it would be just a, you know, kind of a function of increased attached rates, which is giving you the confidence that you're going to have another big growth year in hardware. Just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nI think you are, yes. Yeah, I mean, the business has great confidence in terms of what they're hearing from customers and customers plans and budget plans. But you know, I push back on the forecast and as you know, I mean, the hardware itself from a purchasing perspective has some degree of seasonality in it. But like a Q4 would always be bigger for purchasing activity from customers than a Q1. And now that we're down to more normal lead times, you kind of have that growth Quarter over quarter built into the forecast. Now again, I've been conservative in the. Second half on that forecast but still. Even with my conservatism, I still have second half been higher than the first half for hardware.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nGot it. Okay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nGreat, thanks for squeezing me in. Just to follow up on some of the earlier questions. So I think of your growth as being tied to the R&D budgets at your customers, not the revenue at your customers. And certainly R&D budgets, they tend to move around more steadily perhaps. And then Anirudh, you mentioned earlier, a lot of your revenue is ratable at the same time. So basically changes can take some time to work through the model. I just wanted to ask though because I think 2024 has the potential to see a pretty big inflection and R&D spending within the semi customer base.\nIf you are maybe seeing that, you know, A is it included in your outlook starting the year and then B if it does end up moving higher and influencing kind of renewals and purchasing decision, does that actually manifest in a bigger way? Probably more in 2025 than it really would in 2024.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah Joe, that's a very good observation. I mean definitely the, you know, we are like, you know, we are very diversified, we are very ratable, we are tied to R&D which are all good things in our model. And then the mood seems to be changing a little bit. 23, as we have mentioned before was a tough environment though. We kind of grew very well and there was some change I feel in Q4 in the overall, I mean you guys know that as well in the overall macro sentiment and maybe there will be more investment in 24 and 25 but I think we based our outlook and John can comment more and more on the backlog that we see rather. Than guessing what will happen in 24 and 25. But if there is an improvement in R&D then that's good for our business.\nBut we do see that there's a. Lot of design activity and then we see our position improving EDA and IP. Especially this year and continue expanding in SDA and AI.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, certainly everyone feels seems to be more optimistic this year compared to this time last year. This time last year everyone was asking me when was the recession going to happen. But this year design activity seems to be strong. Even when we talk about China, we're still seeing strong design activity in China but I de risk the guide for that because part of the large outperformance in China last year in achieving 17% of our revenue was because of that hardware backlog. And now that we're back to more normal lead times, it's thought it's prudent to assume that the China revenue drops back to prior levels of between 14, 15%. That's embedded in the guide.\nI thought the right, I mean the approach this time of the year is always try derisk the guide for the things that we think people might be concerned about that and then have the business focus on doing the best, best business with customers for the long term. That we always feel our, our Cadence. Employees do the best business when they're not chasing.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nOkay, yeah, I think that's all smart. And then I guess John, just on kind of your approach to forecasting the upfront revenues. Yeah, I think in 3Q you were kind of intimating that look, we're running at kind of an elevated share of total. We haven't typically been 15% coming from upfront products. So maybe it normalizes and now it's changing and suddenly it's going to remain a higher share of total. Can you just go into what changed in 4Q and is any of that kind of AI, obviously verification hardware? I mean these AI designs basically need the cutting edge. Is AI acutely being seen in the strength of your hardware order activity?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, yeah, of course that and partly it's that. I mean if you've seen over the last number of years we've seen the upfront contribution to our revenue mix has been increasing and it went from 15% in 22 to 16% last year. And I think what you're referring to is we expect it to go to 17.5% this year. That's a virtue of an expectation that we're going to have another record hardware revenue year, that we expect stronger IP growth this year compared to last. We feel much more confident in contribution from IP growth and of course we're launching new products all the time now in relation to things like Millennium, we expect a large part of Millennium sales to be cloud based, but maybe not all of them will be cloud based. I think that's another tailwind potentially for upfront revenue for the year.\nBut I've hedged back slightly what I expect in the second half because I'd like to see the pipeline in the summer before we take that up even higher. But the forecast is higher than 17.5% but I'm only comfortable with going out with a guide of 17.5% for upfront. Revenue for this year.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nAnd just to add, I mean AI contributes to, I mean AI design activity. As you know, contributes to hardware strength given our strong position. And also AI is more HPC and Chiplet based and it does help our. IP business as well. All the comments on Millennium. Let's see how it progresses. Yeah, I mean the IP is also strong this year along with hardware and Millennium.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn it back to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence as we enter 2024 with product leadership and strong business momentum. Our continued execution of the intelligent system. Design strategy, customer first mindset and a high performance and inclusive culture are driving. Accelerating growth as we grow our core.

I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered strong results for the third quarter of 2023. We exceeded our Q3 guidance on all key metrics, and are raising our outlook for 2023. John will provide more details on our financials shortly. Notwithstanding the macro uncertainties, design activity remains strong, driven by transformative generational trends such as AI, hyperscale computing, 5G, and autonomous driving. Growing hyperconvergence between electrical and mechanical domain systems, and semis and hardware and software, is driving the need for tightly integrated co-design and analysis solutions. Additionally, trends such as the growing number of 3D IC and chiplet design, and system companies building custom silicon, are accelerating.\nIn this rapidly evolving design landscape, the relevance of AI-driven design automation cannot be overstated, as it's enabling customers to accelerate their pace of innovation while enabling them to meet their targets more efficiently. Over the past few years, we focus initially on incorporating powerful AI algorithms in our core engines, and then build our generative AI solutions on top of our software platforms. We are seeing growing momentum for our comprehensive JedAI generative AI platform, with an increasing number of customers adopting these solutions and achieving exceptional quality of results and productivity gains while still in the early stages. Sales of our GenAI solutions have nearly tripled in the last year. Our solutions are enabling marquee AI infrastructure platform companies to deliver their next-generation compute, networking, and memory products.\nLast quarter we had referenced our successes with NVIDIA and Tesla, and this quarter we are pleased to announce that Broadcom has accelerated the adoption of Cadence Cerebrus across multiple business units, achieving impressive quality of results. In Q3 we pioneered leveraging GenAI's LLM capabilities to chip design, successfully collaborating with Renesas on accelerating functional specification to final design. This is a key step in demonstrating the potential of LLMs to automate the translation of natural language specification to final chip design and verification tasks, thereby boosting their quality and efficiency. We also renewed and deepened collaboration with some large semi and system customers in the 5G, AI, hyperscale, and connectivity areas. For instance, we strengthened our long-standing partnership with a global marquee systems company through a significant expansion of our EDA software, hardware design, IP, and system solutions.\nAs the digital transformation in aerospace and defense accelerates, we continued our momentum by enhancing our core EDA and systems footprint with several customers, including at two market-shaping companies. Now let me share some of the business highlights. Starting with Digital IC, with 11 new wins, our digital full flow delivering industry's leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes continued proliferating with market-shaping customers. We are very pleased with the accelerating momentum of our flagship Cadence Cerebrus GenAI solution, whose transformative results have led to its deployment at all of our top 10 digital customers and in about 300 tape outs to date. Imagination Technologies used Cadence Cerebrus and our digital full flow on its latest 5 nm GPU design in the cloud to achieve a 20% reduction in leakage power.\nNext I will talk about our functional verification business, which had another strong quarter with 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Ever-growing system design complexity, coupled with the need for first-time-right silicon, continue to drive strong demand for our Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 hardware platforms that provide industry-leading system verification and software bring-up capability. Our hardware business had a record Q3, with close to half of the hardware orders including both platforms. Highlights for the quarter include a major dynamic duo expansion with a top AI and automotive chip supplier, and a significant deal with the market-shaping data center chip company. Our flagship custom IC business continued to pave the way in analog innovation, delivering 15% year-over-year revenue growth.\nWe are pleased with the reception of our AI-driven Virtuoso Studio solution, as several marquee customers adopted it for their N2 and N3 design, and it has close to 1,000 downloads since its launch six months ago. Nisshinbo Micro Devices utilize the Virtuoso Studio custom IC design platform to gain a 30% reduction in turnaround time for routing analog blocks in Q3. We continued investing in our IP business and closed acquisition of the Rambus PHY IP assets. Customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive to the addition of their HBM and GDDR IP to our standard IP portfolio. Design IP had a record booking quarter with strong AI and chiplet design activity, especially in the mobile, automotive, and hyperscaler verticals. In addition, we launched our Tensilica Neo NPU IP and NeuroWeave software tools to accelerate on-device and edge AI performance.\nOur system design and analysis business that is driving our expansion beyond EDA continued to deliver strong growth, increasing revenue by 20% year-over-year. On the PCB front, Allegro X AI has several successful engagements with market-shaping customers underway, and we announced OrCAD X, our next-generation AI-driven PCB design solution enabled by Cadence on cloud and targeting small and medium businesses. Our Fidelity CFD platform continued its strong momentum with customers in automotive, aerospace, and defense and industry verticals. In summary, I'm pleased with our team's continued improvement, innovation, and execution. We are well positioned to benefit from the tremendous opportunities ahead as we help customers design their differentiated products with improved quality of results, productivity, and shorter time to market. I did want to take a moment to comment on the unfolding conflict in the Middle East.\nThe ongoing violence and loss of innocent life is truly heartbreaking and a matter of global concern. The well-being of our employees and their families in the region is of utmost importance to us, and we continue doing everything we can to support them. Our thoughts are with everyone who has family, friends, and loved ones there, and we are helping out by providing humanitarian aid through the Cadence Giving Foundation. John will now go through the Q3 results and present our Q4 and updated 2023 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line results in Q3. All businesses contributed to revenue growth, and we completed more hardware installations in Q3 than we originally assumed. Here are some of the financial highlights from the third quarter, starting with the P and L. Total revenue was $1,023,000,000, GAAP operating margin was 28.6%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 41.1%. GAAP EPS was $0.93, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.26. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash balance at quarter end was $962 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $650 million. Operating cash flow was $396 million, and we used $125 million to repurchase Cadence shares in Q3.\nBefore I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to highlight that our outlook contains the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year. Our updated outlook for fiscal 2023 is revenue in the range of $4.06 to 4.1 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 30.5% to 31%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 41.5% to 42%, GAAP EPS in the range of $3.48 to 3.54, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.07 to 5.13, operating cash flow in the range of $1.3 to 1.4 billion, and we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares.\nAs a result, for Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $1,039,000,000 to $1,079,000,000, GAAP operating margin of approximately 31%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 42%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.91, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.36, and we expect to use approximately $125,000,000 of cash to repurchase Cadence shares. As usual, we've published the CFO Commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In summary, we are on track to deliver a strong 2023. I am pleased with our team's continued execution of our intelligent system design strategy, with our updated outlook for 2023.\nAt the midpoint, we now expect revenue growth of approximately 15%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 41.75%, a seventh consecutive year of greater than 50% incremental operating margin, and non-GAAP EPS of $5.10, a sixth consecutive year of high-teen or better non-GAAP EPS growth. As always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q and A roster. Your first question comes from Charles Shi at Needham.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask you a little.\nBit about the backlog.\nLooks like the backlog compared with last quarter was up. I mean, the September quarter kind of implies very good bookings for September quarter. Just want to ask you, see, the backlog will continue to grow into the.\nYear end because you talked about the second half booking strength. I want to see where it goes from here.\nThank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Charles, thanks for the question, and thanks for remembering what we said last quarter. Yeah, we expect a very strong second half for bookings, and Q4 is exceptionally strong. Our expectations for bookings is very, very strong. Q4.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham\n\nThanks.\nMaybe I want to ask one quick follow-up.\nYou kind of raised your full year.\nRevenue outlook a little bit less than.\nYou beat the Q3 in terms of revenue. Kind of implies that your full year outlook you provided Q1 goal was largely accurate. There seems to be some timing.\nShift for the revenue.\nI mean, pulling in from Q4 to Q3, was that related to your comment about hardware installation, the timing of that?\nThank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThat's right, Charles. You know, in hindsight now I was a little too prudent in the Q3 guide with respect to hardware installations that were scheduled in China around the end of September. If you recall, in our guide we assumed that those installations would fall into Q4. In actual fact, we completed those hardware installations, and the second half looks stronger than we thought this time last quarter. You know, even with all of those hardware, we kind of beat our expectations in Q3, and Q4 is higher than we thought.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next is Gianmarco Conti at Deutsche Bank.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, hi.\nThank you for taking my questions. I guess my first one would be when do you expect to be giving out more AI KPIs, whether on contract value uplift or penetration rates, specific any color you can provide us, somehow can we quantify the AI tailwind in your numbers, and whether we are going to see this coming through in bookings in some time? Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, hi, it's Anirudh, let me take that. Like we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing a lot of activity in AI, and that's a, you know, multiple customer and multiple verticals. Whether it's the system company designing their own chips or, of course, the semiconductor companies designing it, or we mentioned this time, for example, Broadcom, which helps, you know, other companies design it, we are participating in the AI kind of design process in all three ways. Last time we talked about NVIDIA and Tesla. On top of that, it's also applying AI to our own products, and then we have these extra generative AI products on top of our base products that also drives revenue.\nThe first part, which is build out of the AI infrastructure, whether it's with, of course, large semi companies like NVIDIA, or large system companies like Tesla, or companies like Broadcom, I mean that's a big part of our business. We don't break that out specifically because it's sometimes difficult to figure out exactly, you know, what part of customers' business is AI or not. We don't want to be in that, to try to guess, you know, what part of our, what the customers are using it for. AI is a significant portion of, you know, design activity and the build out that's going to happen for years. Now, there's a second part of our business in which we are selling AI products ourselves, you know, as you know, like Cerebrus, Verisium, and our JedAI platform, which has five main products.\nIn that segment, if our own software products and IP products are AI enabled, we did comment that even though it's early in the process, our revenue from our own AI products has almost tripled from a year ago. We are very pleased with that progress. I just want to highlight that and also say there's another part of AI, which is the build out of infrastructure, which is more difficult to predict.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGianni, I would just add to that that, you know, when Anirudh calls out that the revenue from those products has almost tripled in the space of 12 months, we're not reclassifying any revenue. This is direct revenue attributable to those five products that we have in our JedAI platform, right.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's really good, thank you. I just have a follow-up, perhaps talking a little bit on China. If you could comment on whether there is any impact from the entity list and the new rules come into place. Also, if you have any visibility into Chinese customers, into trying to understand whether you actually know whether they're designing at more mature versus advanced nodes. I feel like there's been a lot of conversation around whether there is a way to track whether EDA tools are being used in China for mature versus advanced nodes. Any color on this, it would be great. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a good question because there were a lot of recent reports on some of the changes in regulation. For us, you know, there's not that much difference. You know, most of the regulations were targeted at some chip companies or manufacturing companies. As you know, we are in the design process. Those regulations, the latest round, doesn't have a, you know, big effect on Cadence business. Now, there are some companies added to the entity list, you know, so we monitor that carefully. Since we are so diversified geographically, and, you know, in terms of customers, you know, that's not a significant impact either. All our guidance that we just gave includes the impact of all these regulations that were announced recently.\nOf course, we carefully follow all US regulations, but the latest change is not, not that material to our business.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Go next now to Harlan Sur at JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, macro conditions in the semiconductor industry are still fairly muted.\nRight.\nWe're close to a cyclical bottom, but recovery seems more gradual than expected across many different end markets. Right. Accelerated compute and AI are strong. Auto, industrial, enterprise, service provider markets still relatively soft. Across the metrics that you track, renewals, hardware buys, IP, take rates, is the team seeing any signs of hesitation or push offs across your different customers or different businesses?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Harlan, that's a good question. You know, like we mentioned last time, we still see a lot of strong design activity, and I would say compared to like three months ago, I would say the activity is similar. You know, like you mentioned, some segments are going through tough times, and then some segments like Accelerate Computing AI have a lot of growth. Overall, as you know, these products that our customers are designing take several years to develop, and we are part of the R&D cycle. What we see is the customer still investing in R&D for building our products for the future, and we are glad to partner with them. I think, I would say that largely the environment is similar than it was like a few months ago.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, absolutely. On the hardware side, we're producing hardware as fast as we were all year. You can see in our 10-Q that we filed today that the value of finished goods in our inventory was less than $10 million at the end of the quarter in Q3. The demand is really strong still, and we're just producing the hardware as quickly as we can. We're expecting a very strong Q4 as well for our IP group. I mean, they're delivering a number of silicon solutions to our customers in Q4, and I think that sets up a really strong quarter for that group. We were expecting that all year.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYep.\nNo. Appreciate the comments there. You know, one of your large AI SoC customers recently laid out their future roadmaps, right? Given the complexity of all these next generation AI compute workloads, they're actually accelerating their chip roadmap. New GPU chip every year versus every two years, which was their prior cadence. On top of that, they're starting to segment their product lines, right? Not only accelerating roadmaps, but more chips per product family. I've got to believe that other competitors in this space are doing exactly the same thing. Are you guys seeing this step up in design activity? Obviously, much higher productivity is required. How is this all being sort of reflected in the business momentum and your visibility?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, good point. I mean, like you said earlier, the macro environment is challenging, especially some of the segments are weaker, some are stronger, but design activity is very strong. I would say in two verticals for the future, for the future of the semi and the system business. At least the two very, very strong verticals in terms of design activity are data center and AI, and then automotive, given the electrification and the massive transformation that's happening. If you look at even, you know, you know this anyway, you know, Harlan, if you look at for the next three, four years, these two segments will grow significantly, the whole AI-driven data centers and automotive.\nBecause they are growing so fast, first of all, the cadence of those end customer products is increasing, and also they need to be more and more efficient given the design activity and complexity is going up. There's more design activity and also use of AI to accelerate and be more productive. Even we are using AI internally to be more productive ourselves. Definitely for these two big verticals, and this is a multi-year trend, you know, this is not a. You mentioned some of our large customers. We are very fortunate to work with, you know, we always say we want to win with the winners, and we always focus on the leading companies in the data center and AI space, and also now in the automotive space. That activity is strong, and I expect that, you know, to continue.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, well, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Gary Mobley at Wells Fargo.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. John, your upfront license revenue year to date has averaged around 17%. I think typically it's 15%. Given where you're at in the verification hardware product cycles, Z2 and X2, and the conversion of the backlog there, how do you see that upfront revenue trending, you know, looking into next year, and related to that, you know, how would you see the influence on overall growth next year?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, great question, Gary. I mean we're always watching that carefully. As you know, last year the upfront piece ticked up to 15%. This year, I think in the 10-Q, if you look over on a rolling four quarter basis to the end of Q3, it's at 16% now. I think your point is probably closer to 17% for the first three quarters. I think that's a reflection of the strength of hardware on the ratable and recurring part of the business, although that's 84% of the trailing 12 month revenue. If you look at our guide at $4,080, I mean we're assuming essentially about a 13% growth rate on a recurring revenue line for the year. That's consistent with, like, over a three year CAGR basis is about 13% as well.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOf course we're not guiding next year.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nUnderstood, understood. All right. I suspect that we're not going to get any more AI metrics out of you, Anirudh, but maybe if you can just give us a sense of where we're at in the commercialization of the five different AI tools. Have those started working their way in the baseline license renewals, or are they still on a per design basis, and maybe give a sense of where you expect them to cut into, you know, baseline licensing activity?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Gary, that's a good point. We are watching that carefully, of course. As you know, these JedAI and these five major platforms are new products that our customers should engage with us on, and they run on top of our existing kind of leading platforms. It depends on the customers. I would still say we are still in the early stages of the adoption of these AI products because, as you know, any of these new software tools takes years to fully deploy. Right. I mean, this is what happened in digital or in any major kind of platform releases we do. Even though we are like two years into it, I think it'll still take some time to fully deploy these products.\nWhat we have said in the past is, typically, at least in my experience with digital, about seven, eight years ago, it took like two contract cycles for them to fully deploy. That's still three, four years to go. You're probably like two, three years into it and still three, four years to go, which is a good thing in my mind, because this is natural progress of deployment. Now it depends on the customer. Some customers are adopting them in a much bigger way, especially like in the previous discussion, the new kind of AI designs or hyperscalers, there is like an improved cadence of design activity. They are adopting them maybe a little faster than some of the other verticals. It just depends on some are still on, like, you know, tried on few designs or few groups.\nWe have seen some pretty broad kind of deployments, and that helps our overall engagement with that particular customer. That's what I would like to say, Gary, that I think it's still early, but one good thing, I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that all top customers are now fully engaged, and some of the results are truly remarkable. Actually, I was talking to one major customer recently, and they are getting, you know, like 8% to 10% power improvement from Cerebrus. Okay. We have mentioned several of these in the past also. I mean, that's a huge improvement. You know, sometimes that's equivalent or roughly equivalent to a node migration.\nYou know, typically you go from one node to another, you may get like 10% to 15% PPA improvement, and you're getting close to that or, you know, roughly, you know, two thirds of that from better AI tools. The value is there, and you know, that's what we are focused on. Make sure the products really provide value, and then work with the customers in the pace of deployment that they want to see because it's a natural process to try some and then deploy. Some of them are doing it much faster, like I mentioned.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Jay Vleeschhouwer at Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. For my first question, I'd like to ask a variant of the EDA market environment question. On the one hand, what are you seeing in terms of unscheduled new business, that is to say intra contract new or expansion business, could be construed positively. On the other hand, how concerned are you about the evident deceleration of semi R&D growth? It's still reasonably good, better than four or five years ago, but somewhat slower than it's been. A lot of that can be attributable to Intel. Still, how are you thinking about those two different dynamics? I'll ask the follow up.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, hi Jay, good question. I will be just watching it carefully. You know, like you said, like we said earlier, I mean design activity is still strong, but of course the macro environment is challenging. You know, it's like natural. Even though the customers realize that, you know, they need to invest in R&D for the future, if you know the revenue is impacted because of macro situations, you know that that decisions become a lot more prudent. This is just natural business process. In general, still the large customers in the big segment, they're all investing in R&D. Design activity is still strong. We just have to see. We had a good Q3 in terms of bookings like we mentioned. We'll see what happens in Q4, and that will also give us a better idea going forward.\nA lot of our customers come back and purchase add-ons during the course of their baseline contracts, and with the teams releasing significantly new business, new products from the different R&D groups, the customers have an intent to come back and keep purchasing. They don't wait when we launch AI tools, they don't wait for the baseline renewal to come up or to expire to purchase them. They'll purchase add-ons, and they'll purchase a few licenses, and then hopefully proliferate more on the contract renewal. As you know, we have a lot of contracts that come up for renewal in Q4.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nUnderstood. For follow up, I'll ask about some interesting Cadence management comments. At last month's Cadence Live event up in Boston, there was an interesting comment about the role of AI as, quote, de-risking schedules in addition to the design exploration use case. What's interesting there is historically schedule risk or completion risk has to do more towards the back end of the process, for example, physical verification. To the extent that more of that risk mitigation moves up earlier in the process, do you think that there will be a spending share shift within the totality of EDA spend? Perhaps some from the back end more towards the front end where you play with a lot of your tools?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nJay, I would say that it should lead to more design activity if we are able to reduce risk in the design process. I mean, as you know, this is the history of EDA, history of automation, even for the last 20, 30 years. I remember in the old days in the 90s, we would take like five years and 500 engineers to design some big chip. Now that takes six to 12 months and maybe 50 engineers. That's like 100 times more efficient than 25 years ago. I think AI can, as you know, provide the next generation, next level of improvement in productivity and risk mitigation. I mean, part of it is also risk mitigation. I think it should lead to more design activities, especially by the system company. Now the shift of front end to back end.\nI mean, I think backend is still a complicated process and, you know, I think even though some of the things can be pulled up front using AI or using, you know, hardware platforms, I still think the backend design process requires, you know, a lot of work. I would expect it affects all of them. The other thing we are trying to do on the front end, as you may have noticed, is really incorporate LLMs, you know, like our partnership with Renesas, because all of the front end process has been less formal. You know, the backend process, you know, especially once we have RTL, then we go to gates, we go to GDS, is a very formal process, a very structured process. The front end of the process, especially verification and specification, has been less formalized.\nI think AI and LLM can help formalize that, which definitely, like you said, can minimize the risk. I think activity should still be strong in both front end and back end. Our goal anyway is to make the design easier so more customers and more people can do them.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you, Anirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Jason Celino at KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nJason Celino\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thanks for taking my question. Maybe first for John, you know, on the Q4 guide. Apologies for asking this again, but folks might, might be wondering tomorrow, I guess, why aren't we seeing more upside to the guide for fourth quarter? Because where might be some conservatism or what might we be overlooking in terms of the setup?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOh yeah, Jason, as you know, your question probably emanates from the fact that, you know, we beat by $23 million in Q3 and raised by $10 million. That was mainly due to a prudent guide for Q3 with respect to certain hardware installations. I think overall we've taken the quarter up, the year up by $10 million at the midpoint. I think there's, because it's expected to be a strong bookings quarter and a particularly strong quarter for our IP Silicon Solutions group, that, I mean, they're having, they're going to have an excellent Q4. We're expecting that all year. I think if there's upside, they'll probably come from that group.\n\nJason Celino\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay, okay. No, that's fair. Just to make my quick follow up on backlog, you know, I know you've got some weird comps because of the hardware stuff. When might we see year over year growth again? I guess if we stripped out the hardware related backlog, I don't know if there's any way to share what type of growth you might be seeing.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I think just to give you a bit of color on that, I think if you recall at the end of last year our backlog included about 28 weeks of lead time on hardware. I think we're down to an eight to 10 week range now on lead time for hardware. Of course we've eaten some backlog as a result of that. I think we troughed out essentially in the middle of the year. We're expecting the second half to be stronger for contract renewals because the number of contracts expired in the second half. In Q3 you saw backlog starting to tick back up again. We'd expect it to tick back up again in Q4 because we have a strong bookings quarter, or we're expecting a strong bookings quarter.\nThe one I'd look for really is the annual, the kind of CRPO is the one I track because I'm looking at the annual value, and I think when you compare the annual value at the end of this year with the annual value backlog at the end of last year, the thing to remember is the fact that there'll be so much less hardware in it, I would expect, because we have the production capacity now to deliver on the hardware.\n\nJason Celino\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay, perfect. No, super helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nGo next now to Vivek Arya at Bank of America.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Early for a 2024 outlook, but Anirudh, I was hoping that you could give us some color, you know, given that your model is 85% recurring. Just conceptually, what is the likelihood Cadence can maintain this kind of mid-teens growth rate, and what would make 2024 different or similar to 2023 from a growth perspective?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah.\nHi Vivek. You know, like before, you know, in Q3, you know, we don't comment on the next year. You know, we are diligent, we want to make sure we finish out the year, see what Q4 looks like, and then we'll be glad to share, you know, our assessment in our next, you know, in the full year in a February earnings call. That is what we have done in the past, and that has worked out well. Right.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. On the IP side, I think John, you mentioned that you're expecting a strong quarter for IP in Q4. I was wondering how much would your two recent acquisitions contribute to that? Just longer term, do you think IP as a category over or under grows EDA, and does that influence your growth prospects? Both kind of near and longer term question on the IP business.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOkay, well let me take the first part of that and then I'll hand it over to Anirudh for the second part. I think in relation to the IP business, like I say, we're expecting a strong Q4 for that group. I mean, if you look at the guide we've given for the year, essentially we're guiding to 14% to 15% revenue growth for the year, which means Q4 over Q4 is going to grow kind of between 15% and 20%. Now, largely that's due to the strength of our IP business in Q4. Do you want to talk about the longer term?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Vivek, I mean, as you know, already more customers are outsourcing their IP needs, and we have always participated in that, and we always said we want to participate in that in kind of a star IP portfolio so that it's more and more profitable. The profitability of our IP business has improved over the last few years, and I think we are overall happy with the profitability of the IP business. Now we're trying to see, okay, what other areas can it grow and maintain profitability. I think the areas that are emerging which are strong are this whole chiplet based design and 3D IC, which are used for a lot of AI and hyperscaler applications. That's also the reason we bought the five assets of Rambus, which is the HBM and GDDR based IP.\nI feel now that our IP portfolio is in the right areas, and also the use of this automotive, hyperscaler, and AI IP that are, and most of these markets are evolving into chiplet-based and 3D IC-based designs, which also have certain new IPs like UCIE and other things. As a result of that, we are investing more in our IP business, as you saw, and then, you know, we expect a strong Q4, and then we'll see what happens in 2024.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nJust to clarify, the contribution from acquisitions is likely to be immaterial for this year. The strong Q4 that we're expecting is really from organic business.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Ruben Roy at Stifel.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nThank you. Anirudh, I wanted to ask if you could maybe talk a little bit more in detail about the collaboration with Renesas and kind of incorporating generative AI LLM into chip design. I think you mentioned, you know, some expectations for quality improvement, efficiency improvement. I would think that, you know, longer term you'd be thinking about productivity improvement as well. Are those milestones, you know, that you're expecting to have answers about.\nWithin.\nNext year, two years? It sounds like this is, you know, sort of a longer term collaboration, and you know, sort of testing going on today. Just wondering, you know, sort of what you're thinking about time frame in terms of incorporating some of these types of tools into chip design. Along with that, you know, just the final part is would you consider this a leading edge design that Renesas is working on, or if you could talk a little about the type of design, that'd be great. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, absolutely. I mean, we are very pleased with the collaboration with Renesas, and I think they have a whole initiative if you follow them or if you look into AI for their design process. We are glad to be a very close partner with Renesas, as we are with other companies. We just wanted to highlight Renesas this time. The collaboration is broad based. I think they're using almost all of our AI tools, whether it's Cerebrus for digital or verification, Verisium, and other tools. We are also doing some new collaboration with them on LLM, like we mentioned. The LLM collaboration is fairly broad based. It can be applied to any kind of design. Especially, Renesas has a range of design all the way from advanced node to mainstream nodes.\nThe other, you know, you may know all this already, but the key thing, you know, one benefit of AI is that, you know, of course the quality of results can be better, you know, productivity can be better. There are other benefits which are also true for large, kind of global companies like Renesas. The tool that I would like to highlight, which came to the forefront with our partnership with Renesas, one is all these large companies have geographically diverse teams. It's not that the team is only in one location. Typically, they are in multiple locations. The good thing with AI is that we can do, in a lot of cases, design better than a human can do. Also, it depends on the starting point, right?\nIf you have a geographically diverse team, not all teams are super expert. If the AI tool is same or better than your best team, then the reason to deploy it is that wherever you know, just by the nature of, you know, human productivity, there's a variation across the organization. The results can be even greater in your teams which were historically not performing as well as you would like. The other thing is also true in terms of experience. This will happen, I believe, in AI in other industries as well, but it's definitely happening in chip design. If you have three years experience doing chip design versus 20 years experience in chip design, with AI, you know, that gap is narrowing. So, you know, less experienced engineers can be almost as productive as more experienced engineers.\nApart from like productivity and quality of results benefit, it has this other kind of almost workforce management benefit for a large organization like Renesas, because they have organization in multiple locations, and also a wide experience range from young engineers to experienced engineers. This we are seeing in other companies as well. I think what is also interesting is that the companies that adopt these AI tools first and faster will benefit more versus their peers. We are seeing that the fast moving companies, and Renesas is definitely one of them. We talked about, of course, Broadcom, we talked about NVIDIA, we talked about Tesla, and there are so many other kind of great large multinational companies we have the privilege of working with. There is more than one. There is a whole workforce development benefit of AI, which is actually quite profound.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nThat's very helpful. Thanks for all that detail. Anirudh, I guess just a quick follow up. I mean, it sounds, you know, from what you're saying this should be incremental. I mean, EDA has grown nicely if you look at the core EDA growth over the last several years. You guys like to call out the three-year CAGR, but from what's going on here, we should assume that this would be incremental on sort of the way you've seen EDA growth. Can you comment on that? As you think about whether it's software renewals or adding add-ons, as John talked about over the next 12, 18, 24 months. Would you say this would be incremental to sort of that mid-teens growth that the EDA tools have been growing at over the last three years or so?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWell, I would comment on that. I think our style at Cadence is to be patient with our customers, and we'll go at the pace that they're ready. As Anirudh said earlier in the call, we expect to proliferate our AI tools across our entire customer base over about two contract cycles. Some are adopting more rapidly and embracing the AI tools. Some are adopting the AI tools in add-ons, but they might be shaving back their configuration somewhere else. That tends to be a false economy because they'll just come back and purchase more add-ons later. To get the full effect, it probably takes a couple of contract cycles. We're very, very pleased with the start we've made.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nVery helpful. Thank you, John.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Josh Tilton at Wolfe Research.\n\nJosh Tilton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Can you hear me?\n\nOperator\n\nClear?\n\nJosh Tilton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. My first question is just how does the, how does the Q4 hardware pipeline look compared to kind of some of the strength that you saw in the first three quarters of the year? Given that you mentioned that the macro is still challenging, is there any extra conservatism in the Q4 guide to account for the potential for maybe some hardware to slip into next year?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, it's a great question. That pipeline is very strong. I mean, the hardware demand just continues to amaze me. It's just tremendous. Those products are, that verification group is just performing at a really, really high level, and in such a consistent fashion through probably eight quarters now. Very pleased with that. You might have noticed that we kept the same range on the guide from last Q3, from Q3, the same, same range. We thought there's probably a broader kind of array of potential outcomes with the amount of business that we expect to sign in Q4. We're expecting a strong bookings quarter in Q4, and there is a strong pipeline for hardware.\nLike I said in relation to the AI question, you know, we're very patient with our customers, we'll go at their pace, and naturally if something slips from Q4 to Q1, it goes from this year to next year or vice versa. You can have stuff that customers are planning to buy in Q1 happen in Q4 as well, but I think we've accounted for that in the guide. Everything we know is in our guidance.\n\nJosh Tilton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSuper helpful. Just a follow up, obviously on AI, cannot touch it. As that business of yours triples, are you seeing the drive or the want to adopt these AI tools cause more of your users to make full flow decisions when maybe this has been more of a best of breed market historically.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, absolutely, that's a very good point. Because the AI tools, you know, our AI tools will run on the full flow by nature, whether that's digital implementation or it is on and verification. Of course, we believe we have best on breed tools anyway on the base. You know, it's like you have to have the full flow, the basic engines to be best in class, and then add AI on top of them, which is best in class. It is helping the underlying tools. When our customers are doing more AI tools, and also, as you know, we have commented in the past that the AI tools by nature use a lot of underlying tools. When Cerebrus runs, for example, you know, which is an AI tool for digital implementation, which is one of the most difficult tasks in chip design.\nTypically, the customers will use them on, like, you know, one run of Cerebrus will typically run on 10, 20 machines. Each of them could be, like, 32 CPUs or 16 CPUs. They are using a lot of compute, and also they're using a lot of underlying licenses. It could be, like, you know, 10, 10 instances of Innovus, which Cerebrus is running. It is also, you know, synthesis, place and route, and signoff, like in case of digital, and then, you know, logic simulation, you know, formal verification hardware in case of verification. Same thing with analog. It's not just Virtuoso, but it's Spectre. It's definitely a full flow is enabled. Typically, it requires more instances because, you know, we're doing AI-based design or AI-based intelligent search of the design process.\nIt will require multiple runs. You know, typically instead of one or two runs, it may require, you know, 100 or 200 runs. The user were doing that manually, you know, in a sequential manner. We can do that automatically in a more parallel manner. It definitely helps. It's still worth it because you get much better PPA. It's like using more compute, more software, and more automation in place of more human effort, and we can do it faster and a better PPA.\n\nJosh Tilton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSuper helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Joe Vruwink at Baird.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Hi everyone. Sorry to belabor the backlog questions, but I suppose I'm going to. If we rewind two years ago and look at Q3 in the Q4 of 2021, current RPO then went up by I think nearly $400 million sequentially. Is that maybe how you would start to frame just renewal values that are coming due and what you could potentially look to build on? Second part of my backlog question, it gets back to Jason's question on just the changing composition of hardware and software. Just given what Cadence has been able to do on production capacity and ramping there, does that change the relationship in terms of what needs to be sitting in backlog at year end in order to support some sort of next 12 month revenue expectation?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems",
    "content2": "Hi Joe. You know, great questions there, yeah, I guess the way your profile last year has grown, a large portion of that growth would have been, of course, the hardware we weren't able to service at the time. The reason I called out the lead times was, end of last year, that backlog and current year, or the next 12-month backlog if you like, contained about 26 to 28 weeks of lead time for hardware. That's down to about eight to 10 weeks now. I guess to answer the second part of your question there, when you get to the end of this year, because we've ramped up on the hardware production, you'll need less to be in backlog. There'd be less need for revenue to come out of backlog for next year's revenue than there was for this year.\nLike I said, we've kept the production levels at the same level all year. Every quarter we ratcheted it up in Q1, and we've maintained that production level to try and reduce those lead times because we think we're more competitive with customers. I mean, I was impressed this time last year people were waiting, you know, over six months for our hardware solutions. We'd be silly to assume that would continue, as it's important to get the lead times down to eight to 10 weeks. I think that's a more normal, kind of more normal level to get to. Yeah, very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far this year. Again, I mean we're not really talking about next year, but we've got a very busy Q4 ahead of us.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat, thanks John. I can squeeze one more in. I think we're about to lap the OpenEye acquisition. I just wanted to see how that generally is tracked relative to your original expectations, and maybe just get an update about how Cadence is thinking about the opportunity from the molecular sciences group and the role you can play in life sciences. Looking forward to.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nAbsolutely. You know, we are super excited about that. You know, we're super excited about molecular design and the future. It's almost like, you know, where EDA was maybe 20 years ago. You know, before I talk specifically about molecular design, I want to tell you in terms of our product strategy and how that is synergistic and similar too. I see a lot of activity in our main products, which, you know, I would describe as like three layers, you know, three layers. The middle layer is actual, you know, software products that we have, which are like either you're doing like EDA design, or they're doing system simulation, or they're doing finite element computational fluid dynamics, or molecular simulation. That's the middle layer of the cake.\nBelow that is this new emergence of, you know, computational hardware, which is, you know, special purpose hardware. Like we had in the past, we had special purpose hardware with Palladium, which is our custom chip. Now we use FPGAs for, for Protium. We have, of course, x86-based, you know, Intel and AMD CPUs, and then recently a lot of activity on GPUs, you know, especially with NVIDIA GPUs and accelerated computing. That's the bottom layer of the cake. The top layer of that three-layer cake is AI orchestration. AI can provide this new level of automation and productivity, and doing what was typically done by humans can be done with AI, like we talked about Cerebrus or Verisium. This three-layer cake is central to our product strategy. The middle is simulation, which is physics-based, biology-based.\nThe top is AI orchestration. The bottom is computational hardware. Then this can be verticalized across multiple verticals, whether it's EDA and chip design, whether it's package design with Allegro X AI, whether it is Clarity and Optimality, whether it's CFD with Fidelity, and more importantly, like you asked, with biosimulation. The reason we acquired OpenEye is that gives that critical middle layer of, you know, physics-based biological simulation, which are the very few companies that can do that. Then we can add to it AI-based drug discovery and computational hardware with GPUs. As you may know, OpenEye has an Orion cloud-based platform. It already runs on GPUs, giving significant speed-up for biosimulation.\nRecently, and we'll talk more about it in the future, we expanded our collaboration with one major, you know, top five pharmaceutical company to do traditional and AI-based drug discovery on top of OpenEye and Orion platform. I think this thing in the future, if you go forward, and I mentioned in the last time also, you know, the application of AI also I think is going to go into three steps. First step, application of AI is going to be in building out the infrastructure like we talked about. Of course, the great companies like NVIDIA, Tesla, and now Broadcom, so the buildup infrastructure and there's so many other hyperscaler companies, as you know, they're all building out AI infrastructure. That's the first way of AI adoption.\nThe second phase of AI adoption is applying AI to our own products, you know, like Cerebrus and JedAI and Verisium. We talked about that today also, and that's going pretty well. We talked about the progress in the last one year, and that I think will still take several years to go. The third phase of AI adoption is AI applied to areas that were not automated in the past. I think that may take longer, you know, maybe five years plus, but that has to be driven to digital biology and life sciences. I mean, there's a huge application of AI, and to do that properly, we need that three layer cake, and we need AI on top. We need biosimulation with OpenEye bring, and then computational hardware with our leading compute platforms.\nI'm very optimistic about the future. It will take some time. This happens in a quarter or two quarters, but it's right to invest for the future. It is synergistic with the other parts of a lot of the biosimulation, which is similar to what we do in circuit simulation or and things like that. Overall, I would like to say still in the early innings with biology and biosimulation and OpenEye, but it is a good start, and we are investing in it for the future in a controlled way. Of course, we are always financially disciplined, but I think the potential is there in the future for it to emerge as one of the big areas.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThat's great. Thanks very much, Anirudh. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Anirudh DiGasperi at Berenberg.\n\nAndrew Digiaperi\n\nAnalyst, Berenberg\n\nThanks for fitting me in.\nJust had two quick ones. I know most of them were answered so far on this call, but first on the margin, maybe could you lay out, John, in terms of the guidance for the year, I know you took down slightly the top end of the range for the operating margin on a non-GAAP basis. Just wondering maybe if you could lay out what the puts and takes are there? Is it revenue mix? Is it the recent acquisitions that you made that might have sort of crystallized that number and, without, you know, having to answer the second time, like, in terms of investments that you're making for next year, is the pace of hiring going to change at all based on what you're seeing right now?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGreat questions, Anirudh. Yeah. In relation to the margin, you know, the recent acquisitions are more dilutive to this year. We're picking up more expense, we're picking very, very little revenue. We're picking up expense immediately, and that kind of narrowed the range on the margin outcomes for us. At the midpoint of 41.75, I think it works out to be about $5.10 on non-GAAP EPS in relation. What was the second part of the question? Sorry, I've forgotten the second part of the question.\n\nAndrew Digiaperi\n\nAnalyst, Berenberg\n\nNo, no worries. It's just on the, in terms of hiring, just in terms of how you're thinking about it so far.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I mean, it's great. We continue to attract top talent to Cadence. You may notice, though, in our 10-Q, we did some restructuring in August. We initiated a restructuring plan to better align our resources with our business strategy. We incurred about $12 million of costs, comprised of severance payments and termination benefits in relation to headcount reductions. That's, I would kind of categorize that as a bit of housekeeping and preparation for next year.\n\nAndrew Digiaperi\n\nAnalyst, Berenberg\n\nUnderstood.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll now turn it back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. Strong execution of the intelligent system design strategy and customer first mindset continue to drive growth as we expand our portfolio with new, innovative, AI-driven solutions. We are proud of our inclusive culture and focus on enabling sustainable innovation, and honored to recently be named to Newsweek's America's Greenest Companies 2024 list. On behalf of our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect. You may now disconnect."

Cadence delivered excellent financial results for the second quarter of 2023 with strong ongoing. Customer demand for our innovative technology. We exceeded our guidance on all key metrics, and are raising our financial outlook. For the year yet again, resulting in 14% year-over-year revenue growth. 19% non-GAAP EPS growth. John will provide more details shortly. Both our Q2 results and the updated. Outlook for the year. With its unparalleled promise, Generative AI is. Beginning to make a significant impact globally. Our dedicated focus on AI over the. Past several years, combined with our computational software expertise and invaluable data that lies at the core of AI, it uniquely positions us to deliver to this tremendous potential of this transformational technology.\nWith escalating design complexity, increasing design starts, and a growing talent shortage, AI driven. Design automation is crucial in empowering customers. To fully realize their innovation potential, our customers are increasingly adopting our chip, package, board, system, Generative AI portfolio as. They are achieving exceptional quality of results and productivity benefit. With these solutions, customers are ramping up. Their R&D spend in AI-driven automation opening up significant opportunities for Cadence. Our solutions are enabling marquee AI infrastructure. Platform companies to deliver their next generation. Compute, networking, and memory products.\nFor instance, in his COMPUTEX keynote earlier this quarter, Jensen Huang of NVIDIA noted. NVIDIA is a big Cadence customer and commented on the expanding strategic partnership between NVIDIA and Cadence to accelerate EDA. System analysis, AI, and digital biology. Cadence has successfully collaborated with Tesla on. The development of their game-changing Dojo AI supercomputer. Tesla utilized a broad array of Cadence. Solutions across digital, custom analog verification, 2.5D and 3D IC, and system analysis for developing Dojo Chips and Solutions. We are very excited to extend our.\nPartnership to Tesla's next generation Dojo and FSD platforms. Our customers like Tesla are able to leverage the power of revolutionary Cadence Cerebrus Generative AI technology to optimize the quality of results of their groundbreaking AI chips and related solutions. From a product perspective, we began by providing AI driven. Solutions for core EDA applications, then expanded our AI portfolio to include system design and analysis, and plan to extend it to life sciences in the future. With AI as their underpinning, other generational. Trends such as hyperscale computing, 5G, and autonomous driving continue to spur robust design activity across semi and system companies, creating ample market opportunities for our differentiated technology portfolio.\nNow let's talk about our key highlights for Q2. In Q2, we deepened our long standing. Partnership with the marquee electronic system company through a broad-ranging expansion of our core EDA, hardware, IP, and systems portfolio. Emulation and prototyping have become a must-have part of the chip tape out. Software bringer flows and secular demand for our hardware platforms drove our verification business in Q2 to 27% year-over-year revenue growth following a record. 2022 and Q1 2023. Our Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 hardware platforms delivered a record Q2 as market demand accelerated for these best-in-class solutions. With 14 new customers and 45 repeat customers, more than half the orders during the quarter included both platforms.\nDemand for our hardware solutions was broad. Based, with particular strength seen in AI. Hyperscale computing and automotive segments. A global communication services leader successfully deployed. The Z2 and X2 systems to significantly accelerate the development of their data center. Chips for internal use, including those designed for AI applications. Our hardware platform enabled them to accelerate. Their verification workload and software bring-up. Enabling first class silicon and software success. Verisium, our AI-driven verification platform, that's built upon the JedAI database and. Natively integrated with our verification engine is gaining traction at market-shaping customers.\nFor instance, a large mobile chip company is working with us on developing a. New Verisium regression optimization app and a Japanese semi customer is actively deploying Verisium apps across his automotive SoC and already saw a 4x improvement in the identification of erroneous source code check ins. Our digital IC business had another solid quarter with 15% year-over-year revenue. Growth largely driven by proliferation of our digital full flow, especially at the most advanced node at market-shaping customers. Our Cadence Cerebrus solution leverages breakthrough AI-driven technology to explore the entire design space and automatically optimize the digital full flow.\nFlow to deliver transformational results. Adoption and proliferation of Cadence Cerebrus accelerated. With multiple new marquee wins, it is now deployed at eight of our top 10 customers. A leading hyperscaler doubled their run rate through a major expansion that included our. Digital full flow and Cadence Cerebrus. Another market-shaping hyperscaler successfully used our. Digital full flow and Cadence Cerebrus to achieve a 16% leakage power reduction on their latest custom silicon, and Socionext achieved 2 to 3x better productivity with our new Joules RTL Design Studio through analysis efficiency and significantly reduced iterations between RTL and implementation.\nOn IP, our scalable and profitable growth strategy continue. Continues benefiting from ongoing outsourcing trend, as well as the opportunities offered by expanding foundry ecosystem. Demand for our design IP was strong, led by our multi-year agreement with Samsung Foundry to expand the availability of. Our design IP portfolio for Samsung's advanced process technology, we signed a definitive agreement with Rambus. To acquire their PHY IP asset along. With the talented team. The addition of their leading HBM, GDDR5 PHY solutions and SerDes IP enhances our established IP portfolio, providing complete subsystem solutions for demanding networking, hyperscaler, and AI applications.\nOur system design and analysis business continued. Its strong momentum in Q2 delivering 23%. Year-over-year revenue growth. With Moore's Law slowing down and chip complexity and cost increasing, companies are looking to multi-die 3D-IC and chiplet-based architectures to achieve better performance and greater cost savings. In Q2, we expanded our collaboration with Samsung Foundry through the delivery of reference flows and package design kits based on our uniquely. Differentiated Integrity 3D-IC platform, the industry's only unified platform that includes system planning, packaging, and system level analysis in a single cockpit. Our multi-physics solutions, boosted by our Optimality.\nGenerative AI technology leverage differentiated system simulation and optimization techniques to deliver superior results. Our CFD portfolio that includes recently acquired high fidelity simulation technology won large renewals and add-on business with top Aerospace & Defense companies. We were pleased with the new wins and growing repeat orders for our multi-physics portfolio from customers across multiple end-markets. In summary, I'm pleased with our Q2. Results and the continuing momentum of our business. AI driven automation and chip and system. Design offers massive opportunities for Cadence over the long term that seamlessly align with our computational software core competence and Intelligent System Design strategy.\nWe continue to invest in our world. Class EDA system design & analysis, and AI capabilities to deliver cutting edge innovation. To our customers and partners, now I will turn it over to. John to provide more details on the. Q2 results and our updated 2023 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved strong results for the second quarter of 2023. Driven by the broad-based strength of our business, our customers are increasingly adopting our Generative AI portfolio, and they are achieving exceptional quality of results and productivity benefits with these solutions. Here are some of the financial highlights from the second quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $977 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.7%, non-GAAP operating margin was 41.8%, GAAP EPS was $0.81, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.22. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash balance at quarter end was $874 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $650 million. Operating cash flow was $414 million, and we used $325 million to repurchase Cadence shares in Q2.\nWe are increasing our outlook for the remainder of the year due to continued broad-based strength across our technology portfolio. Demand for our functional verification hardware solutions remained particularly strong, and as a result, our updated outlook for the second half of the year reflects approximately 15% revenue growth compared to the second half of last year. Before I provide our updated outlook for the year and our expectations for Q3, I'd like to highlight that our outlook contains our usual assumption that the export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year.\nOur updated outlook for fiscal 2023 is revenue in the range of $4.05 to 4.09 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 30.2% to 31.2%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 41.2% to 42.2%, GAAP EPS in the range of $3.35 to 3.41, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.05 to 5.11, operating cash flow in the range of $1.3 to 1.4 billion, and we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares. A large number of hardware systems are slated for delivery in late September and early October. For the purposes of providing our outlook for Q3, which ends on 30 September 2023, we thought it was prudent to assume that the vast majority of those hardware deliveries fall into October and Q4.\nWith that in mind, for Q3, we expect revenue in a range of $990 million to $1.01 billion, GAAP operating margin of approximately 29%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 40%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.76 to $0.80, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.22, and we expect to use approximately $125 million of cash to repurchase Cadence shares. As usual, we published a CFO Commentary document on our investor relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, we delivered a strong Q2 and first half of the year.\nWith the increase in our outlook at the midpoint, we now expect revenue growth for the year to exceed 14%, which would take our three-year revenue CAGR to approximately 15% and non-GAAP EPS growth of approximately 19%, which would result in an average annual growth rate of 22% over the past three years. As always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support, and with that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. John, Anirudh, good quarter? I think if we take a step back, you know, up 14% for the year, still pretty impressive. Sounds like hardware had another record quarter and was up 27%. I think some investors will still wonder, you know, could it have been even better? Maybe. Can you speak to any areas that maybe weren't as strong that you were hoping, or how do we kind of level set the performance?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Hi Jason, good question. You know, in general, you know, we manage our business for the long. Term and we are pretty positive with the results for the full year. Like you mentioned, it's more than 14% revenue growth, and earnings are growing at 19%. Our strategy of doing EDA plus SDA plus AI with the computational software expertise. I think overall we're pretty pleased. With how all the businesses are performing. Continue to drive on all fronts, working with customers and partners to deliver the right solutions.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Jason, as Anirudh says, we're very happy with, very pleased with the first half performance. If there's anything unusual essentially in the numbers for the first half, I think one unusual thing for me would probably be the operating cash is flat in our guide to last quarter. That's because, as Anirudh says, you know, we manage the business for the long term. There's an opportunity, we've had some opportunities to build inventory. We've had very strong hardware demand, so we need to buy inventory, and we were offered some larger discounts for payment upfront. We embedded that into the guidance. It'll help us with gross margins in future years, but it doesn't help with. Operating cash for this year.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGotcha. My quick follow up. The IP acquisition from Rambus, is it included in guidance? Maybe can you speak to strategic rationale? What goes into the decision build versus buy as it relates to IP? Thanks.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, Jason, everything we know is included in our guidance, but it's immaterial. To us for the year.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, it's a great opportunity for. Us to acquire a very good set of IPs and a talented team. You know what is particularly good. In this case, it is an existing commercial operation. Sometimes we have opportunity to acquire teams. From other semiconductor companies, in this. Case it was existing commercial operation with key IPs like HBM and GDDR. We took that opportunity and we're. Glad to partner with Rambus here. It really helps IP for AI and 3D-IC with HBM and DDR IPs. Overall, I think it's a good acquisition, and we continue to invest in. All our businesses, including IP.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nExcellent, excellent. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham & Company.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. First, I want to ask about bookings. I have a follow-up on hardware. John or Anirudh, are you guys still seeing strong bookings potential in the second half? I definitely saw your bookings. Implied bookings are actually already up in Q2, but I think people are probably accustomed to like a $1 billion+ per quarter kind of bookings. When can we get back to that level? Do you still expect the second half bookings to be as strong as, let's say, maybe first half 2022? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, Charles, great question. Yes, we'd expect a stronger second half for bookings. As we said last quarter, we had very few contracts expiring in the first half of this year, and we have more contracts expiring in the second half of 2023. We'd expect bookings to be higher in the second half compared to the first. When we look at backlog, we filed our 10Q, by the way, so you'll see our backlog at the end of Q2 dropped from $5.4 billion to $5 billion, and RPO at the end of Q2 dropped from $5 billion at the end of Q1 to $4.9 billion. The current value of that RPO, the annual value, as you know, backlog and RPO is a combination of the annual value multiplied by the time essentially that you've contracted with customers. Our current RPO is up from last quarter.\nIt was $2.7 billion last quarter. It's up to $2.8 billion this quarter. We've improved the annual value, and that's typically what we focus on, making sure we're improving the annual value. Yeah, we're very, very pleased with the bookings performance for Q2. It was slightly stronger than we had anticipated or expected. Second half we think will be better again.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nYeah. Is it safe for us to, for you guys to call? Maybe Q1 was probably the 12th in terms of booking, and we are way past that going forward.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes. Yeah, Q1 was definitely a low bookings quarter for us. Q2 was a lot stronger.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Maybe a follow up question around hardware. You kind of said for Q4 you're expecting a good amount of hardware revenue. Maybe it's parked in Q4, but when. Folks look at your full year guidance. Your Q4 isn't really up by a lot. They implied the guidance for Q4, but given you just said that bookings are expecting relatively strong, I would think the ratable part of the business should see a very strong sequential growth into Q4. The layer. On top of that hardware strength, being you're expecting Q4, can you kind of reconcile what you guided for Q4 versus the commentary you made about hardware and bookings? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, Charles, I think you're referring to the step up from Q3 to Q4 in our guide. We're guiding about $1 billion of revenue in Q3, with a balance of just over $1,070,000,000 in Q4. Now, that's slightly exaggerated, the Q3 to Q4 step up. When we originally looked at the top-down forecast for the second half, there was a lower step up in revenue, mainly due to software increases in annual value in software bookings that we expect. When we looked at the hardware and the timing of when hardware deliveries happen, and there are so many that fall late in the quarter, we thought it was prudent to assume that those bookings, we should include them in our implied Q4 guidance, so to speak, rather than including it in Q3 because I'm not really sure about the timing of those.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi, this is Blake Freeman. I'm from Vivek. Just wanted to start out if you could provide some insight on how you quantify benefits from AI. Just looking at the semiconductor landscape, there have been several AI related design programs that started a few years ago. Would you say you've already seen. The benefits in your financials or should we expect even more growth acceleration in the future? If you would comment on the. Attach rate of your AI enabled products to baseline contracts, that would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYes. AI has multiple implications for us. The first part is we enable the development of AI systems. This is more like a horizontal application. Like we talked about our partnership. With NVIDIA, and there are other companies building AI systems. Like we talked about today, our partnership. With Tesla, which is building both, you know, server side AI and, you know, on the car AI, and then other kind of data center companies. That's a. We are in a unique position to supply to all the, whether it's GPU, data center, or automotive applications of AI to do the AI build out. I think that is still continuing. There will be more and more systems designed. Our tools and IP can play. A key role in that.\nThat's kind of the first application. I believe we are still in the beginning stages of that kind of build out and monetization. The second part would be more vertical, applying it to our own products. We have JedAI platform, which is with a unique position as a kind of a data platform for AI, and then five unique AI applications all the way from analog, digital, verification. Package. Board and systems. I believe we have the most comprehensive product portfolio for chip, package, system design.\nI think we are in the early stages, but we are seeing a lot of adoption of those kind of vertical applications, and we are also using them internally. We design our own chips for Palladium systems. Right. We have a big application engineering team that work with customers. Not only are we providing solutions to our customers and partners on EDA and SDA, but we are also using them internally and seeing good benefits. The third part, which is more out in the future, you know, I think AI will also drive new kind of applications, and one of the biggest ones is definitely going to be life sciences. We are laying the groundwork for that, you know, with our OpenEye.\nYou know, there's a lot of opportunity to apply their AI there in digital biology, which will pay out in the next five to 10 years. For all these kind of three big, there's a horizontal play for building out the AI systems, GPUs, and data center. Other things, vertical play of EDA and system both to our customers and ourselves, and emerging areas that will emerge in life sciences. Overall, I feel we are very. Well positioned to really capitalize on this mega trend.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Blake, to answer your revenue question, I mean, I think it's clear that it's showing up quickly in the hardware space. We feel on the software side it'll probably take a couple of contract cycles for that to flow through. We're seeing strength in pockets on the software side, but the software side, because it's recurring in revenue, will take a while to play through. You're definitely seeing the impact of AI in hardware. Strong hardware demand.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGot it. Helpful. Just quickly as a follow up, hoping we can discuss your capital allocation policy as well. Given the pretty solid cash position and significant cash generation of the company, is there any interest in allocating more cash towards share repurchases? Also, if you could comment on any interest in issuing a dividend in the future as well.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Blake, we look at that all the time. In terms of our cash allocation policy, in Q2, we used $325 million on stock rep purchases. $200 million of that was due to an accelerated share repurchase. The timing of that was timed deliberately to coincide with our merits and promotion cycle. You might have noticed as well in our guide that expenses take a step up, and margins slightly down, second half compared to first half. That's because our pay rise and promotion cycle kicks in on 1 July at Cadence, and that's typically when we do our stock refresh for employees in the company.\nBecause we grant a lot of stock at that time of the year, in our stock repurchase approach, we want to make sure that we're offsetting the dilution first, and then ideally we want to reduce that share count over time. We've talked about dividends with the board from time to time, but we think it makes most sense to use our excess cash for stock repurchases. Our policy is essentially to use at least 50% of free cash flow to repurchase our shares, and that should more than offset dilution, see the share count continue to decline over time, and give us enough to grow the business.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nNo worries.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Business question first, then a technology question as a follow up, Anirudh. As you know, for the last couple. For years we've often spoken about how. Semiconductor companies and systems customers have become increasingly alike. The question though is in what important ways do they remain dissimilar in terms of sales cycles, conversion of RPO to revenue, services requirements, account profitability, anything you care to mention that continues to distinguish those two classes of customers?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Jay, I mean, like you also written, right. I mean the semi companies are becoming system companies, and system companies are becoming semi companies. You know, some, you know, traditional semi companies are, you know, much more. System companies now with software. You know, a lot of traditional system companies are doing a lot of semi, you know, one of the big, several big semis are done in system company. There are a lot of similarities. You know, you're asking in terms of differences. I mean, I guess one key difference has to be that the system companies by definition have hardware and software together. You know, you are a system company.\nBecause you have software and also have electrical and mechanical together. I mean, a good example is a car, right? It's a merging of electronics and mechanical, and it's emerging of hardware and software. For that reason, I think, you know, like the strength we talked about in the hardware business, a lot of it is not just for chip design, it is for software bring up. We are seeing that in AI applications, a lot of the software has to be built along with the hardware. Even for, you know, even for. You know, NVIDIA, which is traditionally a semicompany, has a lot of software, of course. CUDA and a lot of the data companies that are doing their own chips. Have a lot of software. I think the enablement of software becomes key.\nThe other thing is this merger. Of electrical and mechanical. That's why our whole investment, you know, in system design and analysis, in thermal. Simulation, which is a big thing for. Data centers and cars, you know, electromagnetics, you know, CFD. The key thing I think is unique is different is hardware plus software, and electrical plus mechanical. Now in some cases we do do, you know, strategic services for some system companies to get them started. I think that's also a unique difference. Sometimes we will provide help them to get going with chip development. I would say, Jay, these are. Probably three big differences compared to. It's good to see the growth in the semis too.\nYou know, we are happy to have. In who new market with system companies, we still love all semi customers, and they're doing phenomenal, you know, and we are partnering with them in all kinds of ways.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nOkay. As the technology follow up at DAC two weeks ago, there was a quite interesting presentation by Cadence at the conference related to AI and there was the. Use of a very interesting with regard. To productivity or where productivity is going. To come from in future for EDA. That term used by Cadence was task abstraction. A new kind of abstraction from the decades of abstraction we've seen in EDA for the last, well, many years. How are you manifesting that new concept of abstraction in terms of product development, packaging, all those sorts of things going forward? Since that term seems to be very. Much a critical part of your thinking going forward for EDA productivity.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Jay, you know, if you step. Back, right, you look at, you know, fundamental innovations, of course we have a lot, we talk about a lot of things. You know, if you look at mathematics or computer science, I mean, there are two big innovations. One is abstraction, the other is parallelism. In the history of EDA, it is moving up the abstraction layer, right from all the way from polygons to transistors. To gate to RTL and also parallelism. You know, the last 10 years. You know, I think if you look at history of EDA, it started with abstraction first as you know. In the last 10 years.\nIt went back to more parallelism with use of cloud computing and CPUs. With this AI there is opportunity to do more abstraction, you know, move even higher level. You know, basically the real opportunity is. To automate mundane tasks, right? What was done by the user. Can be done by the AI engine. Abstraction will provide, in the end, a lot of automation and productivity improvement. We are seeing that, you know, we can apply it to even technology design, technology co-design, you know, DTCO with leading foundries. We can apply AI to design a. Floor planning and higher level functions, which. Are previously manual applied to 3D-IC partitioning with Integrity. Overall, this theme of applying AI.\nDoing more abstraction, doing more of the. Mundane work and let the user focus on higher level tasks and be more. Productive is only the beginning of that, and is enabled in all these aspects. Digital verification, system design, and so on.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you. Anirudh, if I could start from where you left off there. I had a question similar to Jay's, but I was wondering, I think you mentioned that Cerebrus with AI was deployed at eight of your top 10 customers, and just wondering today, can you talk about how AI is being used? Is it mostly place and route, or are you seeing some of these other areas being implemented in leading edge designs, whether it's packaging or even some of the floor planning, et cetera? How far along are we?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nIt's getting pretty pervasive. The first thing I'm certain of now compared to like two years ago, we started on this journey two, three years. Ago in terms of working with Cerebrus and our customers. One thing I'm positive now is that, you know, a few years from now almost all our customers will be using these. Tools because they are, it's almost like an irreversible trend.\nYou know, Cerebrus or placement route was the first one in some ways. It has, you know, a lot of adoption. It is extending to, like I mentioned, working with foundries, working with, you know, floor planning, higher level functions, verification. In the end, I do believe verification will have a most profound impact within EDA on AI, will be on verification because it's an unbounded NP complete problem, right? You can do more and more verification. You're never done. That's why you see us investing heavily in Verisium, and we are the first to apply AI to verification. We talked about a couple of examples. With customers in the prepared remarks.\nThe other thing is, you know, areas that traditionally haven't had a lot of automation, like package and PCB. With Allegro X AI, that area has. Not seen automation for like 20, 30 years. For the first time, it is possible with AI. In system simulation. See the system EDA by its nature. Has had a 30-year history of optimization and automation. It was not with, it was more with classical techniques and now with AI. If you look at the system area like CFD or electromagnetics, you know, they could barely simulate stuff, forget optimizing. Not only now we can simulate things, you know, because our algorithms are faster, and we are also accelerating them.\nOn GPUs and all to give massive speed up on system simulation. Now for the first time, you. Can simulate a very, very high-fidelity simulation of the whole car. Then on top of it, Optimality. AI, you can do the design of the car or the shape of the wing, which is what in the end the user wants, right? They just don't want to simulate. All this applies exactly to this. Big market of SD&A. I think that's a huge opportunity. We're already seeing that like even with some of the car companies we work with, we can optimize the shape of the wing that affects performance. Like for a racing car is using AI. We already have pretty promising results.\nWe will talk more about that in the future. I would say that first of all I think it will be deployed. Across all these platforms. It started with P&R, but already we are seeing a lot of potential. In the end, in EDA the huge potential will be verification. The other area I'm very optimistic is system simulation and AI.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThanks very much, Anirudh, for that. Quick follow-up for John. Just on operating margin down a little bit in Q3 with what sounds to me like hardware kind of strengthening towards the end of the quarter and obviously into Q4. How are you thinking about that or how should we think about operating margin and sort of the moving parts between Q3, you've bumped it up a little bit for the full year. If you can help us out on how you're thinking about operating margin in the context of hardware attach rates going up as you exit the year, that'd be helpful, thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, no worries. Great question. As you saw, I think the first half was roughly just under 42%. I think for non-GAAP operating margin for the second half, the guide essentially implies 41% to 42% operating margin. Now, it's slightly down as it has been the last few years in the second half compared to the first half. That's because 1 July is our merit cycle. That's when we do pay rises, promotions, and generally pay increases. The vast majority of our expense base is people and engineers. About 90% of the employees are engineers. Pay increases impact us from the first day of Q3, and that step up in cost is really the headwind you're seeing from Q3 when you compare Q3 and Q4 combined or second half compared to the first half.\nI've exaggerated that a little bit by being prudent with the Q1 or Q3 guide on the hardware side because there's a number of hardware systems that are scheduled to be delivered in late September, and late September, early October is a holiday period in China and other parts of Asia. I'm just worried that some of those will slip to Q4. I've assumed the vast majority of them slipped to Q4 in the guide just to be prudent. That, of course, is impacting the operating margin that we're showing in the guide for Q3. I think if you look at the second half as a whole, generally it's 41% to 42% for the second half when you take out the impact of that prudence.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGot it. It makes sense. Thank you, John.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThanks, gentlemen. A great quarter. Just wanted to dive in a little bit on China. The growth this quarter on a year-over-year basis was quite strong, and anything you'd, any color you could give there on what's driving that and how this continues would be helpful. Secondly, just back on the hardware side, John, you've commented in the past about your production capacity ramping up. Just wondering where you're at midyear here and how lead times are doing.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, I'll start first, then John. Can comment on the inventory. Overall, China, we are pleased to see continuing strong design activity in all kinds of end markets, and also good strength for hardware business. We have also had a good hardware business, China. You know, particularly in Q2, I.\nWould say there was a lot of strength from, from mobile vertical, you know, a lot of companies, you know, some big system companies designing their own own chips, and also automotive, especially EV automotive in China was particularly strong. I mean, China is a, just like the rest of the world, is pretty diverse market, and we play in all aspects of it. Those two verticals were pretty strong in China.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah. In terms of your question in relation to lead times, I think at the start of the year we ramped up production capacity because lead times had exceeded 26 weeks, and we thought that's going to hurt us when we're competing for hardware business. We put a big dent in that in Q1. We ramped up production capacity, we kept it at those levels for Q2, and intend to keep it at the higher production levels throughout the rest of the year. Going forward, we're bringing down those lead times. Our goal is to try and get it down into the 10 to 13 week kind of time frame. We're not there yet though.\nI mean in terms of the guide that I've given you for Q3, even with prudence and all in, if I took the prudence out, we don't need a dollar of Q3 hardware bookings to meet those numbers. We're slightly over the 13 weeks, probably around the 15-week mark in terms of what we have in backlog right now to deliver. We won't actually get through all of the hardware orders that we have in backlog in Q3. Demand is still strong. We are reducing, it's probably around the 15-week mark now, but I'd like to get that down to 10 to 13.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nOkay, great, thank you. Actually, just one more question on the hardware if I can. The Palladium Z2 and the Protium X2 have been out in the market now for a bit of time. When can we expect to see next generation version?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, it's been only out for two years, you know, which is, you know, our last system, it was like, I don't know, five, six years between launches, and I think this one has been out two years, and even when we launch Z2 X2, even Z1 and X1 were doing great. So. Right now we are pretty pleased with these systems, and we also can, you know, add. We keep improving the software. I mean, that's the hardware part of it, but we're always improving the software and compile times that go on top of these systems. There is ongoing software rhythm to them anyway, independent of the hardware.\nOverall, I mean, this is phenomenal performance by the team, and we really appreciate all the support from our customers and partners.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nGreat, thanks very much, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Joe Vruwink with Baird.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nGreat. Hi everyone. Let me begin with a bit of a leading question. You're now talking about second half revenues growing 15%. The multi-year CAGRs are closer to 15% to 16%. There are things on the horizon, not next couple quarters, not trailing, but longer out just in terms of how your customers are acting and also what Cadence is offering that would seem to be better than what you've experienced both in terms of R&D intensity and your potential wallet share. The question is, you know, instead of this 15% rate of growth being the high end of what historical growth rates have been, do you think we're maybe seeing a resetting of the overall base case for growth rates and what might be available to the company going forward?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nWell, first of all I would say. You know, 15% growth rate and 19% EPS growth is amazing performance of any company. We are very proud of the team to deliver this. In terms of, you know, design activity and R&D intensity, I mean that is strong, if not getting stronger. Of course, the overall, you know. Micro environment, tough as it has been. Last year and this year, we do see a lot of semi and system activity. That's not any different than before. We have to carefully monitor how. Things go in the future. Of course. Overall, we're pretty pleased to see the design activity.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Joe, you'll see it in the—we publish our CFO Commentary. In the second page of the CFO Commentary, you'll see that we track three-year CAGRs, but we're really trying to grow the account through a complete contract cycle, and most of our customers do three-year baseline contracts. Then they do add-ons throughout the year that co-terminate with those baseline contracts. We think the three-year CAGR is a good metric. If you look at the revenue growth rate on a three-year CAGR basis, it's continuing to climb. Certainly, the pace of acceleration seems to have slowed down these last two years in the mid-teens mark. Our focus is on driving revenue growth, profitable revenue growth.\nWe're using, we generate huge amounts of cash flow, and we aim to use more than 50% of that cash flow to buy back shares and reduce share counts. We're trying to drive that non-GAAP EPS higher and be disciplined with our stock-based compensation. You'll see our stock-based compensation has consistently been around 8% of revenue, and our non-GAAP EPS CAGR has been 20% or higher for the last five years. With this 19% rate that we're on now at the midpoint of the guide, that has us on track for 22% EPS growth on a three-year CAGR basis for 2023. Our focus is really on bottom line. We care about EPS and growing EPS for investors, and growing profitability and revenue growth is a means to an end, I guess, in that respect.\nWe're very, very pleased that it's continuing to increase.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nOkay, thank you for that. One AI question. I think it's a follow up on Jay and Ruben's questions. The point about it seems like maturity and certainly customer experience, referenceability, it's greatest in the backend areas. It's greatest around Cerebrus. When you think about the pace of adoption on the things you've introduced into market since last fall, do you think it's any quicker or slower than the experience with Cerebrus so far? Is there any reason that debugging verification would not be a prime candidate for your underlying technology? Just wondering if you can maybe compare and contrast the adoption curve.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, that's a good question. I would say that the adoption curves are at this point, I would say they are similar, you know, especially Verisium. As I said, verification is a big area now. They're easier in some sense that there is already a proof point that the. Customers have seen with Cerebrus, so they are confident in our ability. To deliver overall AI solutions. Same thing with like Allegro X, you know, Virtuoso Studio. Also, you know how it is.\nIn this business, right? The customers have to try the things and, you know, they try it on some design, then they do broad adoption. That's always there in new areas as well, like with Verisium and Allegro. I would say overall it is similar, and there's a lot of interest. I mean, the amount of interest in. Other AI solutions apart from the original. Ones like Cerebrus is very high. I would say the rate at. This point is similar of adoption, and this is going to take some time, which is okay. You know, it's a natural process of trying and deploying. Now some areas, you know, it's faster. Like hardware because of the nature of the revenue recognition. Overall, the adoption is great and moving along.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors, Wells Fargo\n\nHey guys, thanks for sticking to my question. I wanted to ask about the commercialization of the five different tools under the JedAI umbrella. I wanted to confirm something first of all, is that in baseline, are those products in baseline license renewals with customers, or are you licensing those on a per chip design basis? Have the tools made their way from price discovery phase to general availability?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Hi Gary. These all are new to products. They're not in previous contracts. All of these products have to. Be purchased, and they can be purchased with the renewal or outside of renewal, as you know, in add-on business. They are not part of existing contracts with customers. You know, we have different business. Models in which we introduce these products just like our base product. As we talk to customers. Some of them are in very wide deployment. I think I gave example in the prepared remarks on what hyperscaler. We had a very, very wide deployment.\nOf some of these AI tools, some are in the early stages, but these are all new products versus what was there in previous contracts.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it, got it. Thank you for that, Anirudh. I wanted to ask about what you're signaling with the acquisition of the PHY business from Rambus. I know you went through a period of time where there was a decision to maybe refocus some of the energy, some of the investments from the company away from IP into areas like SD&A. Now you're making an acquisition to grow some aspect of your IP business, so I'm wondering if you can give us an update on how you view the IP business as it fits with the overall business in terms of investment and effort.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, IP is an important segment of our business. It's like having, you know, five kids, right? We love all the five kids, you know, all five lines of business. Now, one of them is, you know. Very young and growing like SD&A, growing 20%+. That's great. That doesn't mean we don't take care of all the lines of business. So IP, this was a great, great opportunity to get a right team and IP, which is synergistic, useful for AI and 3D-IC. I think at the right time we will make investments in all lines of business, and we have done so, like with Virtuoso, with digital. We want to make sure. All lines of business are competitive.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thank you, Anirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nTake our next question from Andrew DeGasperis with Berenberg Capital Markets.\n\nAndrew DeGasperi\n\nSenior Analyst and Associate Director, Berenberg Capital Markets\n\nThanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I have is on the individual segments. I noticed the IP business in Q2 came down a bit, and also system analysis, slight deceleration. Just wondering if there's anything you would call out for those two and have a follow up?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Andrew. In relation to IP, we've always been expecting more IP to be delivered in the second half compared to the first half. It's actually the opposite of 2022. I think we called that out on last quarter's call as well. We're expecting a stronger second half for IP. IP can be a bit lumpy at times because it's based on the timing of deliveries. On system design analysis, we're very, very pleased with the strength of the growth there again. I mean, all of our businesses are growing strongly. I think when I look at the second half and the 15% that we expect our total revenue to grow compared to the second half of last year, I think all of our businesses are growing double digits in that outlook.\n\nAndrew DeGasperi\n\nSenior Analyst and Associate Director, Berenberg Capital Markets\n\nGot it. In terms of your guidance, if I were to look at the high end of the range for the top line specifically, what exactly would assumptions would we have to make for you to get there or even exceed it? In other words, is there a potential for surprises, positive surprises on that front?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence",
    "content2": "Well, I'm certainly very confident in the second half guidelines, but I'm now confident also in the Q3 guide. I was less confident when I saw all those hardware deliveries timed for kind of the final week and the final few days of Q3. I didn't want to take the risk of including those in the Q3 guide. For the second half, I'm very confident in the second half. As we reduce the lead times on our hardware, we found that we've certainly seen the demand for our hardware strengthen, and we have strong demand across the growth across all lines of business. As Anirudh said, I mean, design activity is very, very strong.\nI guess, you know, to the extent that we can continue to reduce those lead times and deliver hardware earlier, that's certainly a track to the higher end of the guidance range because with hardware, of course, you get revenue upfront. On the software side, growth takes revenue takes longer to kind of play through because of the recurring revenue profile.\n\nAndrew DeGasperi\n\nSenior Analyst and Associate Director, Berenberg Capital Markets\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The fact the full year is playing out as you expected, right? The stronger second half in front of you, your semiconductor, your systems customers continue to drive strong chip packaging, system design activity, and roadmaps, especially in the area of accelerated compute and AI. When you combine this with your pipeline, your renewal visibility, you guys have already said your second half bookings will be strong. Does the team believe that it can grow its backlog for the full year?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nIn terms of backlog, I mean, we don't guide bookings, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect our backlog to end the year higher than here. Where we are here, our focus is really on growing the annual value of that backlog. I mean, you know, like a three-year software contract worth $10 million a year will add $30 million to backlog and to RPO. A two-year contract worth $12 million a year will add $24 million to backlog and RPO. Now, if it's a choice between those two options with one customer, we'll typically take the $12 million a year because $12 million a year is better than $10 million a year, and it'll be a lower booking number, lower RPO number, but it will show up in the current RPO.\nLike I said earlier, if you look at our Q2 backlog compared to Q1, it dropped down from $5.4 billion to $5.3 billion. If you look at our Q2 current RPO, that's the amount of our RPO that we expect to turn up in revenue in the next 12 months. At the end of Q1, with a higher backlog number, that was $2.7 billion. At the end of Q2, with a lower backlog number, that's gone up from $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. Our focus is generally on the annual value. I think I understand where your question is coming from though, because first half was quite light for bookings, we expect the second half to be stronger. I do think that it's, like I say, not unreasonable to expect RPO and backlog to increase from here.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nI appreciate that. For Anirudh, you know, all of the leading edge chip companies are moving to this chiplet stack die based packaging architecture. Their systems customers are adopting these very, very complex board designs right here. You guys benefit with Allegro, Integrity, Clarity, Celsius platforms. Can you just give us a rough sense on the revenue contribution from advanced packaging and board design simulation verification? Is it near 10% of revenues, and roughly how fast is this sub segment growing on a year-over-year basis?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, that's a good observation. Of course, I mean there's a lot of chiplet-based design activity and it. Started in HPC, you know, the high. Performance computing AI, and I think it will permeate to, you know, other parts, other verticals as well. Also all the leading foundries, as. You know, are now leading with their 3D-IC kind of solutions. You know, it shows up in different parts in our business. It definitely shows up in SD&A because. SD&A, you know, system design and analysis includes both the Allegro and all the system analysis stuff, Clarity, Celsius. That's why you are seeing very, very strong growth.\nI mean that's a very, very strong growth number, I would say, especially on a ratable revenue model, right. If you're growing 23% this quarter, you know, 20%+ for the last several years. A lot of it is driven by this 3D-IC chiplet because the system market is interesting, right? The thermal market and the electromagnetic market traditionally. A lot of the new growth is this intersection of chip and system, which is by nature 3D-IC and chiplet. We have a lot of customers buying thermal solutions, especially targeted for chiplets.\nBecause that's a big thing for electromagnetics targeted for chiplets. We definitely see that in SD&A, and then we continue to see that. In our regular business like Virtuoso or Innovus and Digital. I still think this is still early inning. It's still the, you know, baseball analogy. Still the second, third inning for, but.\n3D-IC and it will become the dominant technology. I mean, of course, the 2 nanometer and 1.4 nanometer, all that will be critical, but they will be all integrated on chiplets and interposers going forward. What I see, what I think, what is important to remember, you know, of course, a lot of people talk about chiplets and 3D-ICs, but we are uniquely positioned not only for chip implementation, but then also for package design. We provide the leading, we are the. Leading software provider for package design with Allegro, and then all the thermal and system analysis tools. I think Cadence is, I believe. Very uniquely positioned to benefit from chiplet and 3D-IC.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nWell, thank you for the insights.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi Anirudh and John, and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is, I know you've touched on this a little bit. Could you share some more color on the usage of AI tools in system companies this quarter? Are any of the new wins related to AI tools for system customers? How can we think about the acceleration of usage, not just leading nodes, but in the broader design space, even at more mature nodes? I think investors are thinking what next when taking the current use cases of the next two, three years where the cost trade off might not be as imperative as per se in the GPU market. I imagine is this a function of better price discovery matched with higher adoption, proven use cases?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYes, I think the application of AI. Has, like, as you know, has both horizontal and vertical components, right? Horizontal is building out the AI infrastructure. Those in the beginning tend to. Be, you know, advanced node GPUs and also system companies. The system companies we mentioned because one of them is Tesla, right. That's, you know, they have a server side chip. They have talked about this, which is Dojo, and then also in the car ride with Full Self-Driving. I think that is a pretty, you know, pretty remarkable use of AI that's only going to grow with other companies doing this, other auto companies doing similar things.\nWe have several customers, you. Know, which are hyperscalers, which are building their own silicon for AI. I mean this is well publicized also, and you can guess who they are. We are continuing to work with them, and we had several meaningful expansions in Q2 linked to AI chips done by these large hyperscale companies. Now on the vertical side, it can apply to all of five. Main product portfolios for AI, like we talked with, are built on. JedAI and those that application in. EDA and SDA is not node dependent. That can be in all nodes, and even the horizontal AI application.\nI think it started advanced node, but it will go to mainstream nodes because of edge computing. You know, the edge computing doesn't need to be at 3 nanometer or 2 nanometer, but especially the vertical ones. When we put it AI in Virtuoso or Allegro, or you know, verification, these are, these can be applied across all the nodes, not just advanced nodes. The potential, the benefits are there we are seeing are independent of the nodes, you know, and to just give you example, you know, like in some cases, you know, depends on the design. In some cases we can get like 10, 15% PPA benefit from AI. If you go from one node.\nTo another node, sometimes the benefit is 10% to 15%. You're getting as much benefit from better AI algorithms as moving to a new node. It also improves the efficiency at your current node. I think in terms of applying it to EDA and system design and analysis, that will be node independent.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Just a follow up on hardware. Could you talk about the renewal cycles for hardware? When do you expect a customer to come back and buy newer generation of Protium or Palladium, and if it's in line with the EDA cycle, i.e., two and a half to three years.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah, that's a good question. Typically, what we see, hardware purchases are tied to their design cycles and sizes of the chips, not necessarily tied. To our, you know, when we introduce our new systems, you know, that can help, you know, when we go from Z1 to Z2. Typically, you know, any big customer will typically buy hardware every year because they are doing more designs, or the design size is going up. If the design size goes up, then they need to consume more hardware. That is why this hardware business has been so good over the last four or five years, because it is not a one and done kind of purchase. You need to buy multiple times as.\nYou do bigger and bigger chips and more chips. We have multiple lines now, Palladium and Protium, so it makes it much less cyclical. Than you would expect or what it was like two years ago.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, there's a secular demand for hardware capacity or emulation capacity. It's a pipeline business. Unlike our software business where, you know, when the existing contract expires and the renewal opportunity comes up, typically we see, you know, in the past we used to see a hardware customer come back and purchase a new system maybe, you know, two and a half, three years after the first system. Now they're purchasing new systems regularly because, like I say, demand is really, really strong. There's just a secular trend in that demand for growth of emulation capacity.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector of Technology Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks for sneaking my two questions in here. The first one, I want to go back to the, to the full year guide. I know that you guys mentioned that you expect, I think, hardware to grow 15% year-over-year in the second half. What about compared to the first half? Are you still baking in any conservatism in the hardware guide relative to the strength in hardware that you saw in the first half of the year?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Cadence\n\nJoshua, just to correct that, the expectation for 15% growth in the second half is comparing second half versus second half for total revenue at Cadence. All our businesses, we expect all of our businesses to grow by double digits in the second half compared to the second half last year. Some are stronger than others. In relation to hardware specifically, we've seen strong demand pretty consistently for a couple of years now. In Q1, we ramped up production capacity because lead times had gone over six months. We tried to address those, and it certainly helped with improved demand in the second quarter. We're seeing more opportunities in the pipeline for the second half. That gives us comfort to raise the guide for the second half of the year. It is a pipeline business.\nTypically people only put their opportunities into the pipeline about a quarter before they intend to purchase. In some cases, you might get visibility four to six months in. It's a pipeline business. Right now, we have strong backlog for hardware, and that's fed into our decision to increase our guide for the second half. There is potential for that demand to continue, and if we're going to keep production capacity at the levels we're at right now, it's because we expect that demand to continue into the future.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for clarifying that. My second one, in the prepared remarks, I think you guys used the words full flow and Cerebrus in the same sentence. Are you seeing a dynamic where maybe. Your AI tools are driving more of your customers to want to choose to go full flow with Cadence?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYes, absolutely. That's a very good observation. I mean, one trend that is driving. Full flow adoption is advanced nodes. When you move from 7 to 5. To 3 to 2. That is because things get more complicated, and we architected this years ago to be full flow. That helps. The second thing that helps is AI orchestration or Cerebrus, because it can give better results if the AI engine is able to optimize all aspects of the flow. There is a natural tie in. That is great for us. This is a fabulous thing. Same thing in other areas as well, like verification. Both these trends are accelerating. The deployment of full flow advanced nodes and AI.\n\nJoshua Tilton\n\nDirector, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence with strong business momentum and growing opportunities. The semiconductor and systems industry. With a world-class employee base, we continue to deliver on our innovation roadmap and delight our customers, partners, and investors. On behalf of our Board of Directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. This concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect.\nSa."

I'm pleased with the momentum in our core EDA business as well as our.\nContinued expansion into systems area that provides us both revenue and margin opportunity.\nNow let's talk about our key highlights for Q1. In Q1 we deepened our collaboration with.\nMediaTek, which includes a broad base of.\nOur digital, analog, verification, and system design and analysis solutions. We significantly expanded our collaboration with a.\nMarquee Aerospace & Defense systems company that included the proliferation of our digital full flow, custom verification products, as well as RF and system analysis solutions.\nAnd Cadence.\nExpanded its collaboration with TSMC and Microsoft.\nAs we leverage our Pegasus Verification System.\nCloudBurst platform to accelerate gigascale physical.\nVerification in the cloud. Ever increasing complexities in system verification.\nSoftware bring up continues to propel our verification business to a 31% year-over-year revenue growth.\nHardware based verification has become a.\nMust have part of the customer's design flow, and on the heels of a record year, our Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 hardware platforms delivered a record Q1.\nMarket demand remains strong for these best-in-class solutions, with 14 new customers and nearly 30.\nRepeat customers, customers, more than 50% of the orders during the quarter included both platforms.\nDemand for hardware was broad based, with particular strength seen in the aerospace and.\nDefense and automotive segments.\nOur new Verisium platform leverages big data.\nAI to optimize verification workloads, boost.\nCoverage and accelerate root cause analysis of bugs.\nCustomers are realizing significant efficiency gains, with Renesas seeing up to a 6x improvement.\nIn debug productivity, shortening the time to.\nMarket for its R-Car design.\nOur digital IC business had another solid.\nQuarter with our digital full flow continuing.\nTo drive growth, especially at the most advanced nodes at market-shaping customers, our innovative Cadence Cerebrus solution provides customers an AI-driven cockpit by applying generative.\nAI to explore the entire design space.\nIntelligently optimizing the digital full flow in a fully automated manner.

Now I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q1 results and our updated 2023 outlook.\n\nBlair Abernathy\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our key financial and operating metrics for the first quarter of 2023. As planned, we increased our hardware production capacity to improve delivery lead times, resulting from strong demand for our hardware solutions. Here are some of the financial highlights from the first quarter. Starting with the P&L, total revenue was $1,022,000,000. GAAP operating margin was 31.6%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 42.1%. GAAP EPS was $0.89, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.29. Next, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, cash balance at quarter end was $917 million, operating cash flow was $267 million, and we repurchased $125 million worth of Cadence shares.\nBefore I provide our outlook for Q2 and the year, I'd like to highlight that it contains our usual assumption that the export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year. Also, for the year, we continue to expect our revenue mix to be consistent with the 15% upfront and 85% recurring revenue mix that we experienced in 2022. With that in mind, our updated outlook for fiscal 2023 is revenue in the range of $4.03 to 4.07 billion.\nGAAP.\nOperating margin in the range of 30% to 31, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 41% to 42, GAAP EPS in the range of $3.26 to 3.34, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.96 to 5.04, operating cash flow in the range of $1.3 to 1.4 billion, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $960 to 980 million, GAAP operating margin in the range of 29% to 30, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 40% to 41, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.73 to 0.77, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.15 to 1.19, and we expect to repurchase approximately $125 million worth of Cadence shares.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nAs usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our investor relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, we had a good start to the year. With the increase in our outlook at the midpoint, we now expect revenue growth for the year at approximately 14%. As always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support, and with that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. Now, we'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Semiconductors Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about an observation that is your upfront revenue, your functional verification revenue, and your China related revenue were all very strong in the first quarter. I'm curious to know if all those were related and relate specifically to maybe some pull forward of some customer deliveries or some customer orders, or was it more so a function of having the ability to turn the hardware verification business around a little bit quicker than expected?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, Gary, great question. Yes, they're all related. We were very pleased to be able to ramp up the production of our hardware because we had such strong demand for hardware solutions in the functional verification business. We successfully ramped that up in Q1, and the subsequent upfront revenue benefited functional verification. It benefited China. I think China is up to 17% of our revenue for Q1. That's mainly hardware driven. Again, we wanted to reiterate the fact that, you know, last year we did, our recurring revenue mix was 85% of our total revenue, 15% upfront. We still expect that to be the case for this year. In Q1, because of the increased hardware deliveries, the mix was 80% recurring and 20% upfront for the quarter. We wouldn't expect that to repeat for the rest of the year.\n\nRichard Gu\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOkay, related to that, John, if I'm not mistaken, two and a half months ago, when you gave the initial fiscal year 2023 revenue guide, you were expecting maybe the hardware related business to tail off into the second half of the year. Is that still the expectation, or are you still running near record backlog for that hardware verification business? That's it for me. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, great question again, Gary. Yeah, we were very pleased with hardware bookings again in Q1. We didn't take up the second half of the year. I want to wait until the summer to have a look at the pipeline because hardware is very much a pipeline business. However, we did take up the year by $20 million, and part of that is the beat in Q1, which was some hardware, but the rest of that was strength on.\nThe software side.\nProbably predominantly in the system design analysis space. We raised that for the year, and that's kind of recurring throughout the year. We haven't taken up the second half of the year for hardware. I'd like to wait until the middle.\nOf the year for that.\nWe still expect, I mean, we expect all the businesses to grow strongly this year.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you.\nJohn.\nFor you, first on RPO, according to the 10-Q, it looks like you had.\nAbout a $400 million sequential decline from.\nThe end of Q4 and also a sequential decline in the next 12-month expected revenue from RPO. I know that can move around.\nOf course, with hardware and contract timing and so forth.\nMaybe just talk about the magnitude of that sequential decline in RPO and perhaps any expectations for that the remainder of the year and then my follow up.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, sure, Jay. The second half of this year is very heavily weighted for bookings for the total year. We're very light in the first half of the year for software renewals. The second half of the year, Q3 and Q4, are very strong for software renewals this year, unlike last year. Last year I think the first half was. We had a number of big software renewals in the first half. We don't have that this year. When you look at the second half, of course, I mean any big renewal you have in Q3.\nAt the.\nEnd of last year we had like nine months in CRPO for that, and now it's only six months at the end of this quarter. It's really just a function of renewal timing and the fact that the first half of the year is light for renewal timing. I'd remind you as well, in terms of renewal timing, Q1 and Q2 are the two quarters that are like three years after the breakout of the pandemic back in 2020. Those were light for us anyway in terms of light renewals. The second half of the year is much more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year for software renewals. You see that impact on the RPO and CRPO to a lesser extent.\nThere was some drop off on hardware because we deliver so much hardware in Q1, but it's mainly the timing of renewals.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nOkay, understood.\nAnirudh, for you on AI, the product launches the last couple of weeks, including last week, and the customer presentations were certainly very interesting. I just wanted to ask you about management comment at the conference last week that you were making massive investments in AI. What was interesting about that is just some of the ad hoc conversations at the conference suggested that the AI.\nDevelopment teams are relatively small, perhaps a.\nFew dozen per product or per group, but not necessarily very large percentage of your R&D headcount.\nWhen you say massive investment, in what other ways perhaps do you mean that?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Jay, good question.\nI think first thing I would like to say, just to add on.\nTo what John was saying earlier, I mean there could be some fluctuation in renewal timing, but the great thing about our business is we are not sensitive to that, right?\nI mean it's mostly ratable business, but what I'm pleased to see is that both in system and semi companies, that design activity is very strong. Okay, because a lot of these products are.\nI mean, we are resilient to the.\nOverall kind of macro environment.\nResilient because our products are critical and essential.\nYou know, we are mostly ratable business, and we are very diversified, as you know, both geographically and markets.\nNow, in terms of AI, I mean.\nThis is having, of course, a significant effect in terms of the amount of automation we can provide and the increased automation we can provide. We are embedding that, you know, as we mentioned in our Cadence Live conference last year, in all products. It will be pervasive throughout the product line. I'm actually pretty pleased to see not only our base kind of JedAI.\nPlatform, which is, you know, you need.\nA data analytics platform to really do AI in an intelligent, comprehensive way, but also, you know, there are five big.\nPlatforms on top of JedAI, from chip to package to board to system.\nWe always had Cadence Cerebrus, which is doing phenomenal with more than 180 tape outs. Verisium for verification. Now Studio, you know, Virtuoso Studio for analog with layout migration and, you know.\nDesign centering using AI and then X AI.\nFor Allegro, you know, PCB and packaging.\nOptimality for system design and analysis.\nIt's a very comprehensive portfolio.\nYou know, amount of R&D.\nInvestment just depends on different products. You know, sometimes we have it within the product, sometimes we have outside, but it will be pervasive through the product portfolio.\nLike I have mentioned before, you.\nknow, our strength in computational software, you know, naturally allows our regular, even legal R&D to do a lot of AI. You know, we of course have AI.\nSpecific R&D, but our regular R.\nGiven the rich history of EDA and computational software, you know, we can embed that in our product. The real value is to really do it comprehensively and make a big difference in terms of productivity, in terms of automation, you know, in terms of PPA benefits that we are delivering to the customers.\n\nRichard Gu\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you.\nJay.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Shi with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGood afternoon.\nThank you for letting me ask a question or two. We really just want to go back to the second half EDA renewal, the expected strength. May I ask, those expecting renewals, are they already in the backlog or not, or are they not in the backlog? You expect to sign a renewal in the second half of the year? That's my first question.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah.\nCharles, yes, just for clarification, all of our renewals will already be in backlog. If there's, let's say, you have a renewal that's coming up in September, you would have had nine months of backlog left on that renewal at the end of Q4 last year. Now you have six months left in backlog. When you get to September, you'll have nothing left in backlog, and then you have the renewal will come through.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nOkay. Okay. Those renewed contracts are not yet in your current backlog. That's what you're saying.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOh, the new ones will not be until we do them in the second half of the year.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it, got it, got it. May I ask.\nYeah, go ahead, please.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI just wanted to clarify that, yes, the remainder of the existing bookings will be in backlog, but that will reduce until we get to the actual renewal date. On the renewal date, we'll have a new booking come through.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThat will be additive to the backlog.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it. Just wanted to really clear this up. I think another analyst just asked about that. The implied booking seems to be down in Q1, and I think you did provide some color. I want to ask from another perspective. I think in the March 2021 quarter, if you still remember the details in that particular quarter, you had some similar relatively lower bookings back then. Now in hindsight, it looks like it was just one-off weakness in bookings and not meaning much in terms of the broader industry trend. Is that the same case this time, or are you seeing some other, more like a trend indicative of the trend going on in industry today? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks for the opportunity to clarify there, Charles. Certainly I didn't see any weakness in bookings in Q1. Bookings in Q1 were stronger than we were actually expecting at the start of the quarter. What I was trying to convey was that we had very few software renewals that came up for renewal in Q1, and therefore bookings were expected to be light. The beauty of the recurring revenue model that we have is that, you know, the timing of those renewals is not especially important, that it's the annual value of those renewals, and that we continue to see growth in the annual value of those bookings. We see growth across all of the businesses.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nThank you, John.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon. Nice job on the strong quarterly execution. You know, we had a call last week with one of the largest ASIC semiconductor companies, a very large customer of yours, that they've got chip design programs with many of the cloud and hyperscalers, and they told us that they're seeing a pickup just over the last sort of 60 to 90 days. Just a meaningful pickup in design activity and design project pull ins on their accelerated compute and AI SoC programs from their hyperscale customers. I guess it's not a surprise given the AI arms race amongst the cloud titans. Have you seen this recent pickup in customer design activity program pull ins reflected in your recent discussions on upcoming renewals and or customer engagements?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Harlan, that's a great point. In general, like I mentioned earlier.\nI mean, there is a lot of strong design activity, you know. We see with our customers, you know, both on.\nThe semi and the system side.\nWhen I talk to our ecosystem partners, the foundries and the IP providers, overall I think design activity is very strong. Now, in particular to your specific question on AI, I definitely see a lot more interest, and the reason is, at least one of the reasons I think which you may know already, is this new kind of generative AI and all this talk about, you know, ChatGPT is that either traditionally, you know, search or this kind of AI inferencing, the past.\nWas done on.\nCPUs, but this new generative AI tools, you know, of course the training is done on GPUs as always. Even inferencing, you know, when you ask the question, you know, a lot of the inference is done on GPUs, which is traditionally, you know, it's a great accelerating platform, but traditionally more expensive than CPU platform. Not only will it drive more and more adoption of GPU and accelerated computing in the cloud, it will also naturally look for customized silicon that can do it much more effectively and efficiently, both for performance and power.\nWe do see generative AI and.\nThe adoption of this more reinforcement learning based inference training and inference, especially the inference part of it, to drive more silicon demand and more customized silicon, and you are correct in your observation, in general, right. We have talked about for several years the need for customized silicon, whether it is for generative AI now or in general for self driving or a variety of applications, is expected to continue, and we are pleased to see continued momentum in that space.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nNo, I appreciate that. Maybe as just a follow on to that question, you know, many of your cloud and OEM customers that historically have worked with these large ASIC companies, we're also hearing that some of them may be trying to go the extra distance.\nRight.\nPull together the capability to do the entire chip designs themselves. Right. Or what we call DOT based models, which I would think would mean further expansion of their design teams beyond just front end design, which again would be maybe more market opportunity for things like your Virtuoso franchise, and many of your backend physical implementation and verification tools. Are you guys seeing this trend as well?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, absolutely.\nI think if you look at this kind of transition of system companies doing their own silicon, I think there are at least three phases of that. That's why I've commented in the past that we are still in the second inning of this. You can look at other companies like in the mobile space when they started doing their own silicon.\nThe first phase is using ASIC.\nProvider, and actually we have great relationship with almost all the major ASIC providers. We have very deep partnership with all the, you know, in all geography, world leading ASIC providers. Typically, the system companies will start with the ASIC provider, then typically go to a COT flow or customer owned tooling. In that, you know, they will do more and more back end design and more and more. Usually, that is, you know.\nMore opportunity for Cadence and so that.\nThe front end and back end can be optimized together. I mean, the ASIC provider can do that too. Typically, the customer will go to a COT flow over time.\nThat's one thing that really has.\nAlready happened in other system companies is happening in the newer ones.\nThe other trend of course is.\nThey will do more and more designs. Also, initially they start with one or two designs, and you can see these examples in all the public ones, like Amazon doing in the beginning a networking chip. Once that networking chip is successful, they move to Graviton, which is a compute server. Once that's successful, they go to AI chip.\nThe number of chips also increases.\nThe third reason that there is more and more business is new system companies get in. Traditionally, like in the auto space, in the beginning only one or two will do it, and then more companies will do it. See, that's why I think there is a growing trend with loss for a while, because there are companies moving from, you know, part of the flow.\nIn house to full flow in house.\nWhich is, you know, moving to COT from ASIC, you know, more and more designs being done, and thirdly, more and more companies doing silicon.\nAll these three trends are positive.\nFor Cadence and the products that we supply.\n\nRichard Gu\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYep. Insightful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Just two questions for me. Maybe my first one. John, you mentioned taking up the full year guidance based on some strengths in system analysis. I'm curious, you know, was this driven more from your existing business there or was it from OpenEye? I guess. How is OpenEye doing relative to expectations?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Jason, we took up the year by about $20 million. About half of that was with hardware from Q1 because that was a big portion of the beat in Q1, and the other half of that was spread across our software business, mostly in the system design, analysis space, and mostly organic. There was some inorganic contribution as well.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc\n\nOkay, my second. Sorry, go ahead.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGo ahead, Jason.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc\n\nOh, sorry. Yeah. My second question on the guide, you know, it looks like second quarter is going to decline sequentially by about 5%, you know, consistent with what we saw last year too. Maybe just a quick refresher on, you know, what's driving the seasonality here.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Jason, I mean, when you look at it, it'll be, it'll be, it'll show up in the functional verification number next quarter. I think when I look at like Q1 was great. I mean, functional verification was up 30% year-over-year. The quarter was up low teens. When I look at Q2, Q2 also looks great. It's going to be up low teens again compared to Q1 2022, but functional verification will be up probably closer to 20% rather than 30%. It's our expectation that in our guide, we're assuming that the recurring revenue mix for the year stays at 85%, 15%. 85% recurring, 15% upfront, same as what we experienced last year. Now in Q1, it was 80%, 20%. There was a lot of upfront revenue for the hardware deliveries that went out in Q1.\nIn Q2, we expect Q2, Q3, Q4 to be less than the 80%, 20%, and it'll average 85%, 15% for the year. You're seeing that in the Q2, guys.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc\n\nOkay, excellent. Also, just Jason, just to add on.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nTo what John said, you know, if you look at the Q2 guide, we're.\nStill up nicely from Q2 of last year.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc\n\nOkay.\nOkay, awesome. Good. Thanks for the clarification.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. I had a near term and then kind of a bigger picture question. Near term, your IP sales have slowed down, I think, for three quarters now. I think they're actually down year on year. I'm curious on what's Anirudh, what's driving the slowdown, and do you expect IP to grow in line with the 14% sales growth for the entire company?\nWhat will help those sales reaccelerate.\nIn the back half?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nVivek, in general, IP is still.\nA good business, and we expect in 2023 IP business to grow in the.\nLow teens compared to last year. There is some quarter by quarter fluctuation, but in general we expect IP business to perform well in 2023.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, what I would.\nAdd to that is that when you.\nknow, IP revenue generally can be lumpy because some of it's upfront, and it's based on the timing of deliveries. Last year, our IP revenue had more deliveries that fell into the first half compared to the second half. This year, it's the other way around. We have more IP deliveries that fall into the second half compared to the first half. It kind of skews the year-over-year numbers. We're very, very pleased with the performance of the IP business. As Anirudh says, we're generally targeting increasingly profitable low-teen growth every year for our IP business, and we're on track for that.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGot it. My bigger picture question is, what is the right, you know, kind.\nOf public metric to gauge how much.\nBenefit you're getting from AI?\nIs it accretive to your pricing, to your growth rate?\nWhat is the best public metric to, you know, appreciate how much benefit you're getting from AI? Is there a scenario where just the improved productivity, right, or accuracy that AI provides, could it?\nEven cannibalize some of your hardware, or.\nSoftware part of the business? You think it's kind of net accretive longer term just given the larger TAM size, and the greater customer engagement? Just what have you seen so far from AI?\nWhat is the best way for us?\nTo track how much incremental benefit and.\nDo you expect it to be net accretive over time?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Vivek, what I would say qualify.\nAI is another way of providing dramatic automation.\nThe history of our industry is to provide more and more automation. I would say AI is like the third wave of massive automation and productivity improvement.\nI mean the first wave was moving up abstraction level, going from transistor level to gate level, to RTL level, to sea level. That's one wave that drove our industry, which is the second wave in last.\n10 years is parallelism.\nCadence has invested heavily in massive parallelism, whether it's on prem or on the cloud. Starting from 2013, we have a lot of parallel products. Now the third wave of.\nProductivity and automation is using AI or.\nWhat I always call AI for optimization, now called reinforcement learning or generative AI. We have a history over the last 20, 30 years of doing this kind of.\nIn all cases it doesn't cannibalize.\nActually, the activity increases, and the amount of software used and the amount of optimization that happens. More and more designs are done with the available resource headcount. I expect AI to do that. I mean, in general, the benefit is so huge that when you get these new capabilities, you use it to do much more efficient design. Okay, I'll give you an example. I was talking to some very senior people in our industry, and one comment.\nHas been that, oh, the Moore's law.\nHas slowed in terms of actual improvements. You're getting from one node to another node. When you went from 65 to 40nm, you get X amount of improvement. Now when you go to 5 to 3, that used to be 20%, now went to 50. Now maybe it's like 10% improvement.\nEven our tools like Cadence Cerebrus or.\nA lot of the other AI-based.\nTools can provide easily 5% to 10 improvement in PPA.\nYou are getting improvement from better algorithms, which are similar to half or full node of a process technology improvement. Okay, and that's just huge.\nYou know, the amount of improvements you.\nCan get from this third wave or third wave of automation, you know, using generative AI is huge. I think that's one metric that we have published a lot in terms of how much PPA and product improvements we are getting. That's what we closely monitor with our customers. I think the other thing is to apply that across, across other things, you know, not just digital implementation, to apply to, you know, package design, to board design, to simulation.\nWhat I think opportunity it gives.\nUs is over time we can get higher share of R&D invested in automation because the complexity of these.\nThings is going up exponentially. The headcount can go up exponentially.\nI expect headcount still will grow five, 10 years from now in terms of R&D spend in our customers, but we can get a bigger share of that R&D.\nSpend applied to automation.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Anirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi there. Hi, Anirudh and John, thanks for taking my questions. On my first one, I just want to touch base again on the AI suite piece. Firstly, whether you're entering a more mature phase of the price discovery mode as you're accelerating volumes, and secondly, perhaps thinking about the specifics of what are the AI demand drivers here, whether those are correlated to increased design at the lower nodes or the other trends that we should be aware of, other than the increase in complexity. That is, some specific trends in the industry that you're seeing beyond the semi players. Particularly as you've mentioned, of course, Optimality and SD&A. If there's anything that we can sort of track or understand what's going on behind the bonnet, I'll ask a follow-up question. After, thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nAbsolutely. I think we talked about chip, right, and how AI can help this third wave of automation, but the same thing can be applied at package and system level. I do want to highlight that, you know, we have talked for a few years on importance of merging of.\nSystem and semis and how system companies are doing semi.\nWe can also provide solutions for system design and analysis like thermal simulation, you know, electromagnetic simulation, you know, fluid dynamics.\nTraditionally, you know, those areas were, first of all, the simulation capabilities were, could be improved, you know, just the raw simulation speed. For example, Clarity for electromagnetic, you.\nWe got order of magnitude improvement versus traditional methods because, you know, applying our computational software expertise, we can do a lot more simulation. On top of that, you know, there are two other things that can jump start, you know, system design and analysis. You're seeing that, you know, even our growth that you're seeing. One thing is use of GPU acceleration. You know, we talked about this in my prepared remark, and I think GPU acceleration is significant for system design and analysis. The other thing is applying AI on top of simulation.\nEDA has a long history of.\nOptimization, you know, not just simulation and AI for optimization of generative AI is really new for system design and analysis.\nBecause they are barely, you know, even.\nThe simulation capabilities were not keeping up.\nThey didn't really have that much optimization capability.\nThe response we are getting from Allegro X AI and Optimality is huge because not only simulation is possible for the first time, but the optimization of simulation, you know, because in general if you're doing some thermal design or, you know, design of the data center. Yeah, yes, you want to simulate or, you know, of a car, but you want to optimize, you know, whether it's the shape of the wing or placement of the racks in the data centers.\nAll this is really now possible with generative AI. I think the impact on this.\nSD&A will be profound, apart from the impact on chip design.\nWe are the company that can.\nCombine those two things and apply AI.\nTo both of these areas.\n\nGianmarco Conti\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thank you. Just my second one is on M&A, whether there's any M&A insight or plan on increasing the portfolio, perhaps in system design analysis. Sorry, in system design analysis, or is 2023 consistent with the plan of distributing cash to shareholders via Buybacks?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I mean, in general we want.\nTo start with the strategy, we feel we have a very, very strong strategy with intelligent system design, this combination of silicon, system, and data. We are very pleased with our progress, and we continue to grow organically.\nPerform well both in terms of.\nRevenue growth and margin.\nYou know, that's our base strategy, base outlook. Now we always evaluate M&A.\nAs it comes up, if it's a good return for our shareholders and a good return in terms of R&D, in general we are pleased with our strategy and our organic execution.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGot it, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Blair Abernathy with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nBlair Abernathy\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThank you. Just a quick question. On the multiphysics side of things, the system design, the growth I think you call it, was around 27% year-over-year. Just want to clarify, was that including the acquisitions or is that organic? Secondly, just on the multiphysics side of things, how are you doing in terms of your go to market strategy and scaling the business up? It looks like it's getting close to a $500 million run rate. Just want to see how you're doing in the go to market side of things.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, absolutely. The growth rate is a combination of organic and inorganic. The acquisitions we made in the past, and in terms of go to market.\nYou know, we have of course there.\nis a lot of overlap with our current customers too. Of course, some of the customers are new customers. We try to leverage both our existing channel, and we also have set up a, you know, a system kind of sales team that targeted new customers that we traditionally haven't talked to. One thing to remember in SD&A is this overlap of system and semi companies, a lot of the leading companies.\nIn SD&A are companies that Cadence already.\nHas a very deep relationships, and we are still selling to the engineering organizations.\nIt's just.\nThe good part is both the EDA and the SDA are engineering software, maybe different parts of the customers' engineering organization, but more and more coupled engineering organization with the combination of system and semi. Then when we go to SD&A.\nSide, we always look at a three.\nPronged approach in terms of go to market.\nOne is direct sales like we.\nFor our EDA business, you know, we have great relationships with, you know, the top customers in the world which are consuming both EDA and SD&A. I think in SD&A there is a bigger portion of indirect or channel. You know, we had a strong channel for our Allegro and Or CAD businesses, which is PCB and packaging, but we have expanded the channel to now include SD&A to bring out new.\nChannel partners throughout the world. The third part of our.\nGo to market is using cloud, and on cloud we announced last year. Go direct especially for smaller customers who don't want to have in their own IT department, and especially in the system space they are much more amenable to direct SaaS kind of cloud offering. Overall, this is an ongoing progression as you said. Now, the business is getting to a good scale, and especially in SD&A we want this three-prong approach of direct, indirect, plus cloud.\nOne thing to remember is lot.\nOf the top customers in SD&A are already existing EDA customers, and that really helps us as we go to go to market.\n\nBlair Abernathy\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThat's great. Thanks, Anirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel. Your line is now open.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you.\nThanks for taking my question. John, I had a question on the commentary around renewals, and just thinking back to the pandemic and how you guys thoughtfully took into account some of your smaller customers and how that might impact some of your software renewals. Just wondering, given the state of the economy right now and we've already seen some slowing in IT spending, do you think you might see some uncertainty given the soft macro and renewals in the second half? You calibrating that into your thinking for full year guidance at this point, or is that not something that you're worried about?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Ruben, I'm not really worried about that in the second half in terms of the renewals. The renewals are with really large, very, very highly creditworthy customers. We did see some softness in the lower creditworthy tier of customers like startups in Q1, and we have already factored that into our guidance for the year for both Q2 and for the year. Generally, at the high, the big renewals are with the strongest creditworthy customers in the industry.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nRight, got it.\nThank you, John.\nA quick follow up for Anirudh on the hardware. It's come up now a few times. Anirudh, on your call, which is nice to see that the take rate or attach rate, I should say, of hardware continues to move up. The numbers have been quite strong, obviously. Is there a way to think about the percentage of your customers now that are on the new Palladium and Protium systems? Just wondering if there's a continued refresh cycle coming around that investment relevant metric at all. To think about kind of what the percentage of customers is and if that continues to go up, is 85%, 15% sort of the right way to think about the longer term mix for the company.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI mean, the good thing with the hardware is that, like we mentioned in the past, it has become almost essential part of the design process.\nIt's almost, it's not, it's.\nVirtually impossible to design these complex chips without use of the hardware platforms. I would say, you know, all the major customers, especially all the big.\nMajor customers that drive most of our revenue are using, you know, hardware anyway. Now there is, so there is always.\nRoom for, you know, refresh of that, you know, of the hardware they're using.\nAs the chips, as they.\nGo to different nodes, I mean we are at like 5nm going to.\n3 to 2 to 1.4 to 1. There is at least, you know.\n10 years of node refresh ahead of us.\nEvery time you go to a.\nNew node, you know, the size of the chip increases, you know, the number of gates that are on a chip increases. You typically need more and more hardware. The capacity requirement for hardware increases. That's why I think that for long term, hardware is going to be in a secular growth period. Not only is it critical, but you need more and more, and that's going to last for at least the next 10 years, if not more. Sometimes there's opportunities for some of the smaller customers to add hardware, and we look at that also, and we have a variety of business models to help the smaller customers.\nAt this point, most of our.\nBig customers are using hardware. Still, there is growth because the chip size increases, or if they're using Palladium, they can use more Protium and vice versa.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI would just add to that, Ruben, that I think your question emanates from the fact that back in 2021, I think our recurring revenue to our upfront mix was 88 12, and of course that grew. The upfront hardware was so strong last year it went to 85 15. Of course, we're guiding to the year of 85 15 now, with the caveat that, you know, we're going to take another look in the summer, and we may take the second half up if we see continued hardware strength because strength continued into Q1. Although we're guiding 85 15 right now, I would take the over on the 15 rather than the under.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThat's really helpful, John, thanks. I guess, just really quick, I know I'm only allowed one follow-up, but just on that point, have lead times.\nNormalized, would you say?\nIs there more work to be done on the production side?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWe should get back to more normal lead times by the middle of the year. We thought it was really important in the first half to prioritize deliveries to customers that have been waiting the longest for the hardware. I mean, as you know, we have multiple uses for the hardware. We want to set up demo models for customers for future sales and things like that. The first quarter was heavily weighted towards deliveries to customers. They've been waiting a long time for those orders. We're still working through those lead times. We expect to be back to more normal lead times by the middle of the year.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThat's great.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is now open.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to take another crack at the topic of AI and adoption. When you think about maybe the best example of Cerebrus within an implementation effort, if you think about the total block engineers at an account, what share of those engineers are typically using the product at this point? In your mind, is that something, as we enter the next round of renewals, it could get more widely deployed across the entire team.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems",
    "content2": "Yeah, Joe, what I would say is that, I mean, like we talked about, I think out of top 20 customers, I think 10 of them are using Cerebrus for production, and then we are engaged with all the top customers, and then five hyperscalers are using.\nI think, but still, you know, it's not, I.\nThink, you know, there's still a lot of opportunity for growth there. Because the way I look at it is especially Cerebrus or JedAI, all these.\nPlatforms that I think over time, they.\nWill become the cockpit. In the old days, in case of digital implementation, Innovus was the cockpit. The customers would run Innovus or try different experiments with Innovus. Now, Cadence Cerebrus can do that mathematically with AI, and you can still combine that with, you know, you can still do manual experiments on top of that.\nI think overall I would expect.\nIn, you know, three to five years, you know, almost all designers would be using Cerebrus.\nWhat they were using, you know, Innovus in the past.\nOkay.\nSame thing with Optimality, same thing with Allegro X AI.\nWe are still way from that. There is still this progression that has to happen.\nI think we are engaged with all the customers.\nWe are, you know, they're using it.\nI think over time, you know.\nIt will become the dominant way of running products, will be using Cerebrus rather than using, you know, the old way. It's like going from, you know, manual cars to automatic cars. You know, some people may still want to drive manual, but more and more people will drive automatically using Cerebrus. I think in that, we are still in the early innings. It's still like years to go in that, and that's good. You know, we are in our business, like we mentioned earlier, we're looking at.\nAnnual contract value and let the natural.\nAdoption happen over the next few years.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay, that's great. On the system design segment, can you, I don't think I heard it, just an update on where you expect growth to be in 2023. In reflecting on the developments here and kind of the upside you're seeing in bookings, is it possible to pinpoint it? Something like you talked about the repeat orders on the organic solvers. You've obviously built a bigger CFD business through some new channel initiatives. Are any of these things more important than others in terms of driving the upside you've seen?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI think 2023, I still expect very.\nGood year for system design and analysis. In terms of initiatives, I think there are a whole bunch of initiatives we are driving. I think what we always say is we are obsessed with best of class products first.\nThat's the most important thing.\nIf the products are differentiated, the customers always use it.\nAll these channel initiatives help and.\nAwareness of our products with marketing helps. In the end, we are always focused on, you know, developing and supporting, you know, making best in class products. You know, we made a lot of progress and benefits.\nI mean, recently, you know, I talked.\nAbout in my prepared remarks. You know, one thing I think in system design and analysis, like I mentioned, I'm very optimistic about use of GPUs. GPUs have done wonders in AI, right, by accelerating AI computation. Traditionally, GPUs haven't worked that well in EDA. They do help EDA, but it can dramatically help SDA because SDA is more kind of the, it's more physics-based simulation. It's more kind of matrix multiplier, which is similar in spirit to AI.\nLike recently with our collaboration with.\nNVIDIA, you know, Jensen talked about that.\nCadence CFD on GPU for the same.\nCost is giving a 9x improvement in.\nSpeed up and 17x improvement in power efficiency.\nYou know, GPUs are slightly more expensive than CPUs. I mean, typically I would guess, you know, at least 3 to 5x. You're getting 30 to 50x speed up on GPUs that, normalized for cost, you're still getting 10x or 9x improvement in speed. That's a huge improvement, you know, based on our special algorithms because we have a long history of massive parallelism in CPUs, and now we are applying it to GPUs, especially in SD&A, both for electromagnetics and CSD.\nI think that can also provide.\nA lot of growth. I talked about AI and all for.\nChip and system, this acceleration on.\nGPUs accelerated compute for system analysis is another big vector. Even in OpenAI, we use GPUs for acceleration. I think that's it. We have multiple ways to accelerate our position in SD&A, but we are always focused on best in class first.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of [Andrew Digasferi] with Berenberg. Your line is now open.\n\n[Analyst] (Berenberg)\n\nAnalyst, Berenberg\n\nThanks for fitting me in. I guess one question I had is, I know you've talked a lot about AI on this call, but just wondering if you think this could potentially lead to more pronounced market share shifts in the future. I know historically there's not have been a lot of market share changes in EDA, but just wondering if we thought within portfolio that you have relative and your investments that you've made relative to your competitors. Do you think that could change?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a good point.\nI mean, in general, like I mentioned, we are always focused on best in class.\nRight.\nSo.\nAI can play big role in that. I do think that the real opportunity for the industry, you know, both for EDA, SD&A, you know, is more and more share of R&D going to automation.\nI think that will be good for.\nAll players, of course we invest heavily, we want to have best-in-class solutions in our products. I think the bigger trend will also be, you know, these things are getting so complex, there's not going to be enough headcount to design these things, you know, five, seven years from now. The bigger opportunity for the entire industry is more shift to automation.\nI think that's good for everyone.\n\n[Analyst] (Berenberg)\n\nAnalyst, Berenberg\n\nThat's helpful. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. Yes, please.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI mean, yeah, the other thing I think the way we are unique is.\nNot just apply, you know, best in.\nClass products in EDA, we combine chip and systems.\nI think that also provides us unique.\nDifferentiation with our customers and our market position.\nThat's the strategy we have been.\nImplementing for the last four or five years.\nApplying AI improves our EDA solution.\nThe combination of EDA plus SDA and computational software also improves our competitive position in the market.\n\n[Analyst] (Berenberg)\n\nAnalyst, Berenberg\n\nThat's helpful. Maybe on just general trends this quarter, just wondering, in terms of the systems business, have you seen any change, particularly in the data center side in terms of demand, or has it been kind of consistent relative to the previous quarters?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI think that, I mean, you know, the news is, I mean it's a tough environment for our, you know, in general, you know, with all the news. In general, like I said, the design activity is strong. Okay. Our results are strong. I think the data center customers still invest heavily in automation and R&D. The new uptake, like the beginning of the call we talked about, the new uptake I think is more.\nThe infrastructure to serve generative AI. I think that's definitely a very active area for the big data center companies.\nBecause these things are really complicated.\nComplex to serve this whole generative AI base. That will require use of specialized.\nHardware, also different kind of hardware mix in the infrastructure. I think that's going to be a change, and that's good for our opportunities for us.\n\nRichard Gu\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Arsenije Matovic with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nArsenije Matovic\n\nVP, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, this is Arsenije for Josh. Just to double click on the systems company strength, I wanted to see if there was any kind of call outs in particular end markets and how maybe the shifts in end markets have changed relative to last year, or any kind of outlook changing in terms of end market demand within those companies. Thanks. Then a quick follow up.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWell, I would say that, you know, in system companies, data center is always a lot of activity, you know, driven by generative AI. I think we mentioned also in our prepared remark, automotive and AMD are definitely seeing a lot of design activity in those. I would, if you have to pick like a few verticals.\nDefinitely data centers with AI and.\nAutomotive AI in general, but also electrification and more A and D. We are seeing that in our own engagements with customers.\n\nArsenije Matovic\n\nVP, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. If we could kind of think about some of the strength in hardware, how much of that is driven from refresh from existing large semi customers versus maybe new purchases from systems companies, if you kind of like quantify that from a high level, be helpful.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI think it's a combination of both.\nThere's both, you know, like the system, the semi companies. As you know, more designs and newer designs require more and more hardware.\nSystem companies by its nature also have software. You know, that's why otherwise there wouldn't be system companies.\nIn system companies, you know, our dual, you know, dynamic view of Protium and Palladium really helps because Protium is more for software bring up, and then Palladium for chip bring up.\nI would say both are strong.\nThere is more software content by nature in the system company.\n\nArsenije Matovic\n\nVP, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCEO and President, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence with strong business momentum and growing opportunities in.\nThe semiconductor and systems industry.\nWe are proud of the innovative and.\nInclusive culture we have built at Cadence. On behalf of our employees and our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This concludes today's call.\n\nRichard Gu\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYou may now disconnect, SA."

The rest of the Board and I look forward to working closely with ML in her new role.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our strong execution in 2022 and are thrilled by the business momentum and market opportunities ahead of us in 2023. Now I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q4 results and our 2023 outlook.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded all of our key financial and operating metrics for the fourth quarter and 2022. Robust customer design activity and demand for our strong technology portfolio continued to drive growth across all of our businesses. Cadence had an excellent 2022, and we began 2023 with a lot of confidence and strong momentum on the back of the stability and resilience you'd expect from a predominantly recurring revenue model.\nHere are some of the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $900 million for the quarter and $3.562 billion for the year. GAAP operating margin was 23.5% for the quarter and 30.1% for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 35.6% for the quarter and 40.3% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.88 for the quarter and $3.09 for the year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.96 for the quarter and $4.27 for the year.\nNext, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $882 million at year-end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $750 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $264 million and $1.24 billion for the full year. DSOs were 49 days, and we repurchased $1.05 billion worth of Cadence shares during the year.\nBefore I provide our outlook for Q1 and 2023, I'd like to share a few comments. Our most recent fiscal year ended on December 31, 2022. This fiscal year will also end on December 31 as we've now moved our fiscal year to a calendar year. Approximately 15% of our annual revenue for fiscal 2022 was upfront, with 85% recurring. At the midpoint of our 2023 revenue outlook, we're expecting a similar revenue mix for the year. And our outlook for 2023 assumes export control regulations remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year.\nIn our outlook for 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.06 billion, GAAP operating margin of 30.5% to 32%, non-GAAP operating margin of 40.5% to 42%, GAAP EPS in the range of $3.24 to $3.34, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5, operating cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2023. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.02 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%, non-GAAP operating margin of 41% to 42%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.84 to $0.88 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.23 to $1.27. And as usual, we published the CFO commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.\nIn conclusion, I am pleased that we achieved double-digit revenue growth across all of our businesses, increased 3-year revenue CAGR into the mid-teens and I'm especially pleased that we continue to expand annual operating margins. As always, I'd like to thank our customers, partners and our employees for their continued support. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.",

Today's earnings release for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, related financial tables, and CFO commentary are also available on our website. For the Q&A session today, we would ask that you observe a limit of one question and one follow-up. You may re-queue if you would like to ask additional questions, and time permits. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anirudh.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered excellent results for Q3, driven by our technology leadership, strong execution, diversified customer base, and resilient business model. We weighed our Q3 guidance on all key metrics and are raising our financial outlook for the year yet again to 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 40% operating margin. John will provide more details on our Q3 results and updated outlook for the year. Notwithstanding the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainties, our thesis about generational drivers such as 5G, hyperscale computing, and AI/ML driving robust design activity over the long term remains intact. These secular trends are accelerating the digital transformation across several end markets, while the growing hyper-convergence across multiple domains—mechanical and electrical, hardware and software, and systems and semis—is driving the strong need for continued innovation in compute, connectivity, and storage.\nCustomers are investing heavily to differentiate their next-generation platforms, with system companies increasingly developing purpose-built silicon, and semiconductor companies benefiting from expanding silicon content. Our comprehensive offerings, comprised of leading end-to-end EDA solutions, IP, hardware, and an expanding systems portfolio, uniquely position us to support our customers while providing us with ample growth opportunities. In an environment of increasing design complexity, tighter time-to-market requirements, and growing shortage of talent, sophisticated AI/ML solutions can greatly help to democratize chip and system development while dramatically increasing productivity and quality of results. Customers deploying our game-changing AI-driven Cadence Cerebrus and Optimality solutions are realizing amazing results. In Q3, we augmented our portfolio with the transformative Verisium AI verification platform and the JEDI data platform. Verification continues to be the critical part in system time-to-market, consuming the vast majority of resources, with debug being the largest component.\nVerisium provides a generational shift in verification, moving from a legacy single-run, single-engine approach to algorithms that leverage big data and AI to optimize multiple runs across multiple engines, leading to a 10x boost in debug productivity. Several customers, including Samsung and STMicroelectronics, have observed impressive results with Verisium for automatically triaging and root-causing bugs. JEDI is our revolutionary AI-driven big data analytics platform that is foundational to unifying our AI innovations across Cadence Cerebrus, Optimality, and Verisium. JEDI operates on a vast amount of data, including all types of design, verification, analysis, and methodology information, to facilitate smarter design optimization and enhance productivity. In Q3, we significantly expanded our footprint with market-shaping customers as they increasingly embraced our optimized platform offerings.\nWe deepened our partnership with BAE Systems across our core EDA and systems portfolio, including proliferation of our digital full-flow, analog products, and a broad expansion of our PCB and multiphysics system analysis solutions. Additionally, in Q3, we strengthened our collaboration with Teradyne, which included a broad proliferation of our core EDA software across digital, analog, and verification, as well as a significant expansion of our PCB and system analysis business. Demand for our core EDA software remained strong and broad-based. Our digital business had another strong quarter, with 22% year-over-year growth driven by key competitive wins and continued proliferation at market-shaping customers. Thirteen new customers adopted our digital full-flow in Q3.\nIt's been just over a year since we launched Cadence Cerebrus, and it's fast becoming a linchpin technology for customers as they derive incredible productivity and PPA results on a wide variety of their most advanced SoC designs. Several leading customers have major multi-design, multi-project production deployments underway, and are reporting up to 30% improvement in quality of results and 30x productivity improvements. Additionally, we see accelerated growth in our front-end and sign-off offerings, in part due to the Cadence Cerebrus pull-through effect. We launched the CERTUS Closer solution, which dramatically accelerates complete design closure by using an innovative hierarchical architecture and a fully automated environment for concurrent full-chip optimization and sign-off. Using CERTUS, Renesas observed 6x faster chip-level sign-off closure versus current methodologies, and MaxLinear experienced overnight full-chip sign-off closure while realizing up to 5% of untapped power savings.\nOur custom IC business continues to define the analog market with its bold vision, market-leading technology, and comprehensive portfolio. In Q3, it grew 12% year-over-year, driven by best-in-class Virtuoso platform, and by strong growth in our spectral simulation solutions. Now, moving on to functional verification. In Q3, our business grew 31% year-over-year, led by hardware and Xcelium. Our Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 hardware platforms, providing industry-leading system verification and software bring-up capabilities, added three new customers and had 20 repeat orders, including from high-end mobile, AI, and hyperscale customers. Our IP business, led by our star IP offerings at the most advanced nodes, continued to benefit from the ongoing IP outsourcing trend, and from customers increasingly embracing IP reuse for risk reduction and faster time-to-market.\nDuring Q3, we signed our largest IP contract ever with the marquee US semiconductor company and had a major expansion at a leading US 5G company. Tensilica extended its leadership in the true wireless stereo market, while proliferating its functional safety and infotainment solutions with automotive companies. We also had multiple design IP wins across our leading PCIe, DDR, and die-to-die portfolio. Our system design and analysis business is a key tenet of our growth strategy to leverage our computational software expertise and expand our TAM by growing in near-adjacencies. This business continued its strong momentum, delivering 29% year-over-year growth as we increased our footprint in several verticals, including aerospace and defense, and high-tech electronics. Our broad systems portfolio, providing tightly integrated platform solutions across the design, simulation, and analysis, is resonating strongly with customers as they increasingly choose a broader set of our solutions across these domains.\nIn Q3, we broadened our collaboration with Emerson, a global industrial technology and software leader, as they significantly expanded their use of our system solutions, notably our PCB, AWR, and system analysis technologies. Fidelity CFD software that was announced earlier this year is ramping nicely, facilitating customers in verticals such as aerospace, marine, and turbo machinery to do design optimizations, leading to efficiency improvement and meaningful reduction in emissions and energy consumption. The addition of Future Facilities, digital twin-based thermal and power optimization technology, will further help data center customers to reduce their carbon footprint. Lastly, we completed the acquisition of OpenEye Scientific, a leader in the computational molecular design space.\nWe are very excited to bring our system-level simulation and AI/ML expertise to the life sciences market to help improve the speed and accuracy of biosimulations, thereby enhancing the efficiency and success rate of the drug discovery process. Integration of both our Future Facilities and OpenEye acquisitions is progressing well. In closing, Q3 was an outstanding quarter as we advanced our intelligent system design strategy and continued to closely collaborate with our customers on their next-generation designs. We are managing our business with an intense focus on innovation, operational excellence, and driving both revenue growth and margin expansion, and are very well positioned to capitalize on the massive opportunities ahead of us. Now, I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q3 results and our updated 2022 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI'm pleased to report that we completed the acquisitions of OpenEye Scientific and Future Facilities in the third quarter of 2022. Cadence exceeded all key financial and operational metrics for the quarter. Here are some of the financial highlights from the third quarter. Total revenue was $903 million. GAAP operating margin was 29%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. GAAP EPS was $0.68, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06. Operating cash flow was $317 million. We used $150 million of cash to repurchase Cadence shares, and at the end of the quarter, our cash balance totaled $1 billion, while the principal value of our debt outstanding was $800 million. Before I provide our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022, I'd like to take a moment to share certain key assumptions embedded in our outlook.\nWe expect the impact of the recent changes to US trade restrictions on our business to be limited and manageable. The impact is included in our outlook. Our outlook also assumes that the export limitations that exist today remain substantially similar for the rest of the year. Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal 2022, we now expect revenue in the range of $3.532-$3.552 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 29.7%-30.7%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 39.7%-40.7%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.71-$2.75, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.20-$4.24, operating cash flow of approximately $1.2-$1.26 billion, and we expect to use approximately $1.05 billion of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2022.\nFor Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $870-$890 million, GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50-$0.54, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.89-$0.93, and we expect to use approximately $300 million of cash to repurchase Cadence shares in Q4. Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In summary, I'm pleased with our progress across all lines of business this year. At the midpoint of our outlook, our Q3 revenue CAGR continues to increase, and I'd like to thank our Cadence team for their exceptional execution and financial discipline. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect our annual non-GAAP operating margin to exceed 40% for the first time, which is especially pleasing.\nAs always, I'd like to thank our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, operator, we'll now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, to please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad now. We will pause for a moment to compile the question-and-answer roster. Your first question comes from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nJason?Celino\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys hear me?\n\nRichard Gu\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, Jason. Go on.\n\nJason?Celino\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Sorry to be straight to the point here, but China's on everybody's minds. It was 50% growth in the quarter. To some extent, it was an easy comp, but it was the largest revenue that you've seen in each period. I guess, where did you see the strength, and then how would you describe the linearity of that strength? Was it all throughout the quarter, or was it front-uploaded or back-uploaded? Curious, and then I'll have a follow-up.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOh, that's a great question, Jason, and thanks for the opportunity to clarify. In Q2, you saw 13% of our revenue in Q2 came from China, and that jumped to 17% in Q3. Most of the increase, the vast majority of that increase, was a result of hardware sales in the quarter, hardware revenue that was recognized from deliveries into China during Q3. That uptick in China revenue is all from upfront revenue sources.\n\nJason?Celino\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Perfect. I did notice that backlog was kind of sequentially down a smidge in the quarter. How much of that was due to the inclusion of some of these new restrictions? Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, another great question, Jason. Last quarter, I think it was $2.75 billion in terms of our current RPO, and that's down to $2.7 billion now. That's partly as a result of that hardware delivery into China. It also includes this quarter, we've included the impact of the new US export regulations. On backlog in total, I think it went from $5.6 billion to $5.5 billion. The RPO piece, that was slightly down more, and we had an increase in IP. We signed our largest IP contract ever, and that's in the non-cancelable commitment portion of our backlog.\n\nJason?Celino\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Great. I'll get back in Q. Thanks, John.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks, Jason.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Anirudh and John, I really just want to go back to the China question. Maybe not immediate Q4 or fiscal 2022, but try to look a little bit ahead. Among your kind of meetings of the total revenue coming from China, I know you sell to China to various kinds of customers. You've got multinationals, you've got the large semiconductor companies, domestic, you've got AI startups, Chinese system companies. Across this wide spectrum of the different kinds of customers in China, what kind of customer, the sales to the customer, could be the most impacted by the export control? Can you kind of quantify to us how much of the percentage of your revenue is going to be impacted because of the latest round of export controls? I have a follow-up to that.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, Charles. This is John. Yeah, the good point there, we did call out that the impact is limited. We believe the impact is limited and manageable. That's not just for Q4, but for the foreseeable future going forward.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nAny thoughts on any specific type of customers that you may see the greater impact in your China market?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Hi, Charles. This is Anirudh. Overall, China is a diversified customer base, and we have a lot of design activity in China. The thing about Cadence is we participate in all kinds of designs, right, whether analog, digital, or memory, and different market segments. Overall, I feel that that will be intact. I think there is some effect on local China foundries in the latest regulations, as you probably know. Overall, our business is very diversified, not just in China, but other geos, and therefore, we feel the impact is limited and manageable.\nLike what John said, not just for the remaining of the year, but also going forward.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about perhaps the indirect impact from the China export restrictions, as well the general semiconductor market backdrop and the challenges this may present for companies like Cadence. You have some of your large customers who can ship product to China because of various export restrictions, one of which can't ship $400 million worth of product because of these export restrictions. To what extent, long term, might the R&D budgets of those types of companies be impacted in relation to that, the chip design activity, as they can no longer sell to various large end markets like China?\nRelated to the overall market backdrop, are you seeing any change in customer behavior with respect to the time it takes to get sign-off on any large license deals?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, Gary. That's a good point, especially the indirect effect and also overall macroeconomic uncertainties. We are carefully monitoring the situation on both of these fronts. As you know, we are more on the design side than on the volume of shipments. On the macroeconomic trends, of course, there's a lot of news in the press, and we are carefully monitoring it. Right now, we see robust design activity. As you know, we participate in all the market verticals. Even if some verticals may be weaker on their shipment side, they will still do design. Some verticals are still good on the shipment side as well.\nWith this combination of us being on the design side and us being very diversified across multiple verticals, right now, we still see very robust design activity. That's reflected in the results that we are reporting today, right, and our outlook for the rest of the year. Now, on the indirect effect on China, that's to be observed also. Again, we are pretty diversified. There's always some effect on some of our customers. Again, we are pretty diversified. Right now, we feel that that's manageable, but we will carefully monitor that going forward.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Thanks for that color, Anirudh. I wanted to switch topics to your JEDI-based AI machine learning tools, including Cerebrus and some of the others you recently announced. I know you're in the early days of price discovery and introducing those products to market. What has been the feedback as it relates to price discovery? Related to that, how deeply you may be seeing penetration in some of your early days customers there?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Hi, Gary. That's a great point. We are super excited about this new AI-based solution because, like I mentioned earlier, this is a great opportunity for EDA to add more value to our customers. If you look at historically, EDA has always been like we have done a lot of great productivity improvements for our customers, but it has always been like a single-run environment, right? You run our tool one time, and then the multiple runs have been managed by the customers. Typically, when you do the design, you're not running our tools one time. You're running it multiple times. With this data analytics and AI, we can really offer solutions in this multi-run environment.\nAI is a key part of that. In a multi-run environment, you also have to manage the data because AI tools run on top of all the data that's generated. We are very proud of this new JEDI platform. It's a new data analytics platform to capture all kinds of data in the design process, and that unifies our solutions across this space. We have three big apps on top of JEDI, on top of this data analytics. One you already know, like CADENCE Cerebrus, which was launched last year. Optimality, which is on the system space, using some of the similar technologies as Cerebrus but applied to system simulation. Now Verisium in verification, which, by the way, verification, as you know, is one of the most time-consuming parts of the design flow and also the one that generates the most data.\nLogic simulation, hardware verification generates the most amount of data in EDA. That's why it was critical to have JEDI to unify all these things, but also get ready for more data like in verification. The adoption has been actually surprisingly good, and all the big customers are engaged. You see in Verisium, we have endorsement from several big customers. We talked about Cerebrus last time. At this point, all the major customers really do want to deploy these solutions. Like I mentioned in the script, not just for one or two designs, we are seeing broader and broader adoption. We are very happy with the progress so far.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Anirudh, for you first, when you look back at the last one or two years, how would you rank the contribution to your bookings growth and/or share gain in what we define as core EDA from the various products that go under Cadence Innovus platform? I assume Innovus has been part of that given its size. When you look at some of the various other sign-off and other tools that you've introduced under that nomenclature, again, how would you rank the new momentum or incremental contribution from those? Perhaps even look out ahead over the next one or two years in that respect. Secondly, for you, John, what has been your experience to date in terms of the predictability of your IP business?\nThis is not a China-specific question, but feel free to talk about China, specifically in terms of the increasingly material upfront component that we've seen for IP rhetoric, as well as for your services engagements related to IP. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Hi, Jay. That's a good question. Actually, I'm very pleased with our strength of portfolio in core EDA. As you know, we have been doing increasingly well over the last couple of years. I can say that Cadence's core EDA portfolio is strong as it has ever been. We want to apply our expertise in computational software to new areas like system analysis and system design and analysis. It's super critical to maintain the leadership in the core because core always comes first. Then we take those expertise and apply it to new areas like systems.\nWe are always focused on the core first. Core parts are, let's say, three big areas, right, in core EDA: digital, analog, and verification at a high level. I feel that we have a very strong portfolio now. In terms of contributions of growth, in analog, we were always strong. I think there were some areas to improve in Spectre simulation, which have been fixed over the last two years. I think analog is more steady. You can see even this quarter, it grew a healthy 12%. A lot of the growth has come from digital and not just Innovus, which is place and route, but also now with Synthesis and Signoff and Cerebrus. I would say digital is growing very well also in terms of strengthening the position in the market. I'm especially pleased with verification.\nNow, verification, there are systemic growth drivers that are helping hardware. I think that some of it is strength of our portfolio, and some of it is hardware becomes more critical to the design portfolio. In verification, I'm actually also pleased with Verisium, our logic simulator. I think that's doing really well this year and over the last couple of years. That completes our overall verification platform because we are now strong in hardware with Palladium and Protium. Jasper, we have always been the leading solution in formal verification. With the strength of Xcelium, it completes our verification platform. I would say the growth in core EDA is driven by digital, number one, verification, close second, and then maintaining and strengthening our position in analog. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nIn relation to your IP question, and particularly the predictability of IP revenue, our focus remains on profitable growth through differentiated star IP that's highly reusable and easier to scale. I've been very pleased with the discipline from the management team that run that business for us, and their ability to target more profitable and sustainable revenue growth. That's what we ask for. We always ask them to run IP like it's our family business, sign us up to business that you'd want to do if this was your family business, not just a public company. Of course, with IP in amongst that profitable, sustainable, regular, recurring revenue, there's also some upfront components to IP that can have more variability. Naturally, we're cautious on that going forward. We'll have to look at the macroeconomic environment and the impact of that for next year.\nWe see a lot of upfront revenue this year in our numbers. I think upfront revenue for 2022 is on track to be almost 50% growth year-over-year. That sets up some pretty tough comps for next year. We'll look at that carefully. Most of that's coming on the hardware side. When I look at all of the businesses across Cadence, they're all on track to go by low teens or more growth this year. Like I said, very, very pleased with the predictability of the IP business, particularly because they focused on profitable and sustainable revenue growth for us.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you both.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask the China question in a different way. How much of your 17% of sales to China were to customers that were involved in or would eventually be involved in sub-14-nanometer logic design or in leading-edge NAND or DRAM? I guess it's just not intuitive that leading-edge design is not possible without your tools. China just got restricted from doing leading-edge, yet you are not seeing the restriction in any ways. It's just not intuitive to me at all.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, Vivek. I mean, we've taken the necessary steps to be in full compliance with the new export regulations, and our guidance includes the full impact. We haven't broken out how much of our China revenue is sub-14-nanometer. We do believe the impact to the company is limited and manageable. Is that a near-term view, John? Is it because you are more involved in analog? Is it because you are in two or three-year contracts?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nIs it because you think that there are other revenue sources outside of China that can help you kind of offset that deficit?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWell, we also feel it's limited and manageable going forward. Again, I mean, we're applying these rules, these new US export restrictions. We've applied them. We've included the impact in our guide. We believe it's limited, and like I say, manageable from an R&D perspective. We have to look at some resources and maybe redeploy some of those resources.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nOkay. For my follow-up, I'm curious, what happens if semiconductor sales go down 10% or 15% next year? What happens to the budget for EDA? Even if you don't decline, is it possible that the growth rate slows down from the mid-teens? I guess asked in a different way, under what scenario would Cadence's growth rate slow down next year? Yeah.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, this is Anirudh. First of all, I think you know already, I just want to remind you that we believe our business is more resilient. Of course, we are not immune to macroeconomic situations, right? At a high level, it will depend on if there is a recession, how severe the recession is, right? Is it a mild recession, or is it like a very, very severe recession? If it's a very, very severe recession, then of course, nobody is immune to it. In general, from our kind of business, I think there are three factors that make it more resilient. One, as you know, we are an essential part of the design process. We are not tied directly to volume of shipment, more to design activity.\nDesign activities, they're both in the semi companies and, of course, the system companies. We are also expanding our portfolio into systems. I think the first part is we are more essential and tied to R&D. Second part, as you know, we are very ratable. Most of our revenue is ratable. Third part is we are very diversified in multiple geographies and verticals. That gives us more resiliency than other companies in this environment. Of course, like I said, we are not immune to it, especially if there's a very severe kind of correction. We are carefully monitoring that. I think when we talk to you next time in January, we'll have more information on the macro situation and can provide more color for next year.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, and the macro will really impact upfront more. I mean, we have a very resilient, robust stream of recurring revenue. I think that's what Jay was getting at in his earlier question about the predictability of the IP business. I feel very confident in the IP business because we've been focused on profitable and sustainable revenue growth there. We've had a really strong hardware revenue year-this-year. I know myself, if there's a severe downturn in macroeconomic conditions, IT budgets are one of the first things that you look at in terms of do you need to purchase hardware, capital equipment, and things like that. That could impact us on the upfront side.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Yeah. Maybe as a follow-up to the last question. Your functional verification portfolio, which includes hardware emulation and prototyping, right, that's up 25% through the first nine months of this year. Very strong growth. If I think about a weaker semi industry next year and think about where the risk could be, you talked about some of the upfront portion of your revenues. I think about hardware emulation and prototyping platforms.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOn the flip side, we continue to hear that design verification and early software development continue to be very significant bottlenecks in these next-generation digital SoC chip designs, so actually very critical to your customer's overall design process. Do you guys agree with this? Given your pipeline visibility, backlog, do you see your hardware emulation and prototyping pipeline, at least as you're looking at it now, remaining relatively strong into next year?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nFrom a backlog perspective, we probably have six months of hardware revenue in backlog. Any kind of increased issues on the macroeconomic front will probably slow down hardware purchasing going forward. We'll need another few months to assess what the climate's like there. Hardware is really a pipeline business. You get about three or six months' kind of visibility into what that pipeline looks like. Again, I think on the hardware side, it's been a phenomenal year. The functional verification group has had a tremendous year this year. We'll be lapping some tough comps next year. We need a few more months to assess before we can guide anything to next year. In general, your thesis is correct. I mean, hardware almost becomes indispensable to the design of chips and electronic systems.\nWithout these emulation and prototyping platforms, it's almost impossible to design that. As the chips get bigger, as you go to newer nodes, the chips, in terms of they get bigger in terms of number of gates, right? The next node always has more gates than the previous node, even if the chip size is the same. As the chip number of gates gets larger, it requires more and more verification and emulation. Overall, I think there is a systemic kind of support of how much emulation and verification needs to be done. It just depends on how that overall baseline growth required gets affected by any large macroeconomic shift. In general, these hardware platforms are almost indispensable now as you do design, and almost all our big customers are relying on them. Yes.\nFrom a business perspective, I mean, we're building out our cloud infrastructure to be able to provide that hardware in the cloud. That changes spend for emulation capacity from being capital spend to expense spending. Now, from a revenue standpoint, though, emulation capacity that's used in the cloud, we would have to recognize that revenue ratably. We do have a business solution if there are cutbacks on CapEx spending.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. I appreciate that. Maybe just a longer-term question because we're hearing more and more about this. On the move to 800 Gb and higher optical speeds in the data center, this is driving a pretty strong focus on more integrated silicon photonic space solutions, either optical module-based or co-packaged electro-optical. Intel, Marvell, Broadcom, NVIDIA, Cisco, some of your big customers, are all working on SiPho solutions.\nI know you guys have a pretty strong portfolio here. You've got Virtuoso Photonics. I think you've got some of your advanced packaging and module design solutions, thermal and power modeling solutions as well. You guys also have pretty strong partnerships with some of the manufacturing guys. How do you guys see this market opportunity unfolding for the team over the next few years?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a great point. I mean, Photonics is big. You also touched on package-level integration. I mean, these things, again, play to the we are in a good position there based on the strength of Cadence. A lot of these things are done in Virtuoso platform, which is the flagship platform. Also, Allegro, which is, again, a flagship platform for advanced packaging.\nOver the last four years, we have built all these analysis tools like Clarity and Celsius for electromagnetics and thermal, which are critical for Photonics and 3D IC. We have a pretty broad solution. The other exciting part is there are multiple vectors of growth that are possible with Cadence. This is definitely a very exciting area, as you know. We are working with all the, because of our position in Virtuoso and Allegro and the new analysis tools, we are working in this very important market.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Yeah. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Gal Munda with Wolfe Research.\n\nGal Munda\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, John, for you. When I think about the guide heading into Q4, especially around the OpEx, what's implied to get to that level of profitability, is there anything accelerated, anything that we need to kind of factor in there in terms of the hiring or on cost side? Do you think incremental margins implied is kind of low 30s to get you to that number? Is it more conservative? How would you kind of assess that part of the guide?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Sure. Good question, Gal. On the operating expense side, of course, it includes a full quarter now of expense for OpenEye Scientific and Future Facilities, plus incremental hiring that we did during Q3 and intend to do again in Q4. You get the full bow wave effect of any hiring in Q3, you have a full quarter of that expense in Q4.\nAlso, on the bookings front, we've seen a substantial increase in bookings compared to our forecast this year. Sales have been very, very good, so there will be increased commission costs embedded into that Q4 guide as well.\n\nGal Munda\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, that's helpful. As a follow-up, guys, obviously, hardware has done really well this year. If you think about back when you introduced at Q4 the guide for the year, and then this is the third raise in a row, look back nine months, what is the thing that surprised you most? Was it the hardware itself, how strong it's been this year, or has it been anything else that's allowed you to keep raising the guide on the top lines throughout the year?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI've been very, very pleased with the performance of all the businesses. Like I say, every single one of our businesses is performing exceptionally well. The lowest-performing business is showing team growth year over year. Absolutely tremendous. What I wasn't expecting was upfront revenue to grow by almost 50% over 2021. I don't think any of us would ever have predicted that. You're seeing a lot of that upfront revenue coming through from hardware. It's the popularity of our emulation systems. It's just been off the charts. Long may it continue, but it's very hard to determine how long that will continue for. We do have substantial backlog already and a long lead time. We're making those systems as fast as we possibly can. I think if you have a look at the inventory, we've less than $10 million of finished goods there. The vast majority of that is already out on demonstration with customers. There's a triage situation that goes on every system that comes off the production line.\nThere's a plan for getting that out to our customers as quickly as possible.\n\nGal Munda\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's really helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John?Marco?Conti from Deutsche Bank Securities.\n\nJohn?Conti\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities\n\nHi, everyone. Yeah, thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations on delivering another great quarter. Now, given the strong, clear performance that you've had in system design analysis, and JEDI, and Cerebrus, could you perhaps give some color on how your customers are reacting to budgetary decisions regarding spend in this category given the current economic climate? Are you seeing customers speaking similar to that with EDA consumption, or is this bucket of software spend more volatile to economic boundaries? I'd imagine companies, particularly for this bucket, are more defensive, generally speaking. I'll ask a follow-up after. Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, hi, this is Anirudh. I mean, it's a good question.Like I mentioned, we are pleased with the adoption of these AI-based solutions because I think it can provide more automation than what EDA tools have done in the past. To some extent, they're also deflationary. You have an opportunity, I think, for the entire industry to move more of the work from people to automation, from people to tools. This is possible because with JEDI, and then Cerebrus, Optimality, and Verisium, a lot of the lower-level tasks, which were very mundane, can be automated. The designer can focus on more value-add, higher tasks. That's the theme of our kind of AI-based solution, to remove the mundane work, make the designer focus on higher-value work, help in terms of you need the same resources, can you do more work? That theme is very popular.\nI've met all these CEOs over the last three to six months. That's even popular in a tough environment because there's a need for more automation. It's even more so, this is actually very timely, the launch of AI-based solutions, launch of Cerebrus, because the productivity of the organization goes up, and also productivity of the talent, because a lot of companies, one big issue is they have large teams which are deployed across multiple countries or locations. The question always is, are you getting enough value from all the locations? Something like Cerebrus or AI-based solution naturally uplifts the talent of your whole organization because these algorithms are the same, whether they're run in one part of the world or the other. I think these AI-based solutions, this is very timely and appropriate in this kind of tough environment.\nI think we have a very good platform with JEDI. We have three major solutions on top of it, and we will do more. I mean, you'll see more from us next year in this area. We are very pleased with the progress, and I think it's very timely to the situation we are in, the macro situation.\n\nJohn?Conti\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities\n\nYeah. Right. Thanks. Just could you shed some color on whether there have been any changes to the backlog growth, pipeline conversion, lengthening of sales cycles given all of what's happening in software? Are your expectations unchanged to that report in Q2, whereas circa half of the backlog is expected to slow in revenues over the next 12 months? Maybe any commentary here on sort of economic impacts for next year would be fantastic.\nI'm just trying to understand if there's any material changes to your backlog to pipeline conversion, in how you're looking at it compared to three months ago. Yeah, any kind of color, that would be great. Thanks.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nFair point, John that when I look at the current RPO, despite the fact that it's slightly down from Q2-Q3, slightly down, including the impact of the latest US export restrictions, also including the fact that we ship more hardware into China in Q3, I feel very, very confident in the current RPO and the RPO, and very, very pleased with the growth that we've seen there. Typically, I know you've just started covering us, but typically what we tend to see is about 55% of what we have in backlog turns up in revenue in the next 12 months.\nGenerally, Q4 is a good kind of add-on quarter for us for growing that current RPO. I feel very pleased in terms of where we are. Annual value is about $2.7 billion now off of a total backlog of $5.5 billion. The annual value is $2.7 billion. $5.5 billion represents time, but $2.7 billion is the annual value there. I would anticipate that should grow through to the end of the year and set us up well for next year for our recurring revenue. The upfront revenue is a lot more difficult to predict because it tends to be more lumpy.\n\nJohn?Conti\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities\n\nRight. That's very fair. Yeah. It's interesting to see how much upfront revenue actually generated this year. Yeah. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Joe Vruwink from Baird & Company.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird & Company\n\nGreat. Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to the IT topic and specifically ask about the record award. If I look at your non-cancellable access arrangements, it looks like that value went from $171 million-$434 million. Is that primarily reflecting this award? Is there anything unusual, or is this a normal term length? Kind of reading between the lines, this big step up in what's visible in backlog, we should see that hitting revenue next year?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, Joe, that record contract in IP is included in our non-cancellable commitments in our number in our backlog. We're delighted with the performance of the IP team and how well they're doing. What's interesting, what I always find is kind of not intuitive when you look at Cadence's results, is that sometimes in the biggest bookings quarters, you may not have a great increase in your current RPO for that particular business. I find when you have big renewals coming around, we tend to play defense on the renewal, and then leave room for add-on opportunities later. Often you can have a big bookings quarter that may not generate a huge amount of growth in current RPO. In contrast, you might have lower bookings quarters where there's a lot of add-on opportunities get booked in those quarters, and that can increase your current RPO and drive growth for the company. In this particular case, it's a record contract, so you're trying to pay more defense on something like that.\nYou haven't seen a huge uptake in current RPO for IP this quarter, but I think that will come later.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird & Company\n\nOkay. That is helpful. I appreciate you're not guiding to next year, but there has been some conversation just around how good upfront deliveries have been this year. Obviously, that creates a tough comp. I wanted to take the other component and just focus on recurring revenue. John, I think in the past, you kind of framed recurring revenue on a three-year CAGR basis. Last quarter, the number was, I think, 12%-13%. You mentioned how you thought that rate of growth was sustainable going forward.\nJust a quarter later, some things have changed, but given the visibility you have in hand today, any difference that you would comment on, kind of 12, 13, or some other rates on a kind of three-year CAGR basis as it just pertains to recurring revenue?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGreat question, Joe. I think I would characterize my opinion on our recurring revenue. I'm more confident now, now that we know what the US export restrictions are. I think I'm more confident in our recurring revenue going forward now than I was this time last quarter. I think the challenge from a macroeconomic standpoint is what the macroclimate does to our upfront business for next year. I mean, that's the toughest one to predict. That's why we need an extra few months just to figure out what that means for next year.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird & Company\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Blair Abernethy from Rosenblatt Securities.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nHi. Nice quarter, guys, and thanks for sliding me in the questions here. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the cadence on cloud and, in particular, the Palladium Cloud. Can you just walk us through sort of how you're looking at this cloud-based emulation, how as a customer coming to you, having to maybe make a decision between an on-prem hardware solution versus Palladium Cloud? Just walk us through that a little bit, and maybe how are you thinking about or how are you approaching pricing?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems",
    "content2": "Yeah. Hi, Blair. This is Anirudh. Thanks for asking this question. That's a very important point. In general, we really like these cloud offerings, especially for hardware, because even if you think about in the regular cloud, right, with the CPU cloud by the big cloud vendors, what they're doing is they're amortizing hardware across multiple customers and moving more from a CapEx to OpEx model. The cloud model has been successful in hardware first, right? You build all kinds of software solutions on top. This is the same hope for our Palladium business.\nWe would want more and more customers to go to our cloud offering because that also makes the hardware business more and more ratable, and also gives a lot of flexibility to our customers. One of the issues with Palladium and Protium being even more popular than they are now is that sometimes the smaller companies are not able to deploy as much as some of the big companies because there is the upfront cost to get a full Palladium rack. Whereas if you have them on the cloud, it gives access to a lot of small companies also to use hardware emulation as they're doing more and more complicated designs. The second reason, of course, is it makes it more and more ratable. We encourage all our customers to move to the cloud.\nWe have built infrastructure in data centers together with some big data center partners to have this capacity in the cloud. Now it depends on customer choice, right? If the customer wants to buy more for in-house use, then of course, we support that. I think I feel customers are becoming more and more flexible in terms of whether they want to deploy on-prem or on the cloud, I mean, the hardware that they buy from us. Like what John was saying earlier, in this kind of tough environment, if they want to reduce CapEx and use more OpEx, then Palladium Cloud gives that opportunity. I mean, this is something we have been building for several years, and we'll see how it goes. In general, we want to encourage all our customers to move to the hardware cloud.\nOn the on-cloud, which is on the software piece, I think like we talked about in the last earnings call, that's also great for startups and also for system companies that don't have big IT departments, I mean, IT departments and data centers. We really feel that on-cloud, that's why we started first with system products from Cadence, is suitable for because system companies, there could be like 50,000, 70,000 customers in that space. Some of them are big, of course, and have their own data centers, but a lot of them are not as big, and they prefer this kind of cloud. It also helps us go to the long tail in a much more smarter way. We want to innovate not just on the product side, but go-to-market side. Especially innovating on the system side, the long tail on-cloud is great.\nPalladium and Protium Cloud are even good for the EDA big customers because it gives more ratability, flexibility, and choices on how they buy hardware. Overall, I think these are two very strategic areas for us, and we want to encourage our customers to use more and more of these cloud offerings.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThat's great. Thanks for the call, Anirudh.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Ruben Roy from Stifel Nicolaus.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stifel Nicolaus\n\nHi. Thanks. Anirudh, I think you answered just about every question there was. I wanted to maybe drill into the new customers on the digital design flow. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what type of customers you're seeing? Is that competitive displacements for traditional semiconductor companies or non-traditional, a combination of both?\nI guess attached to that, are you seeing a higher attach rate in either semiconductor companies or systems companies for hardware these days as you sign up these new deals on digital design? Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, Ruben. Great points. In general, in terms of the digital business, I think it's both new customers and existing customers and taking share. In general, I think what's great about Cerebrus, one is, like I mentioned earlier, it does more automation of mundane tasks. It's almost like having automatic driving versus manual driving, right? You don't have to control all the knobs and all the tedious works. The tool does it for you. It also unifies the platform. We've been talking about unified synthesis, placement, and sign-off from, I don't know, 2014 or 2015.\nI think Cerebrus naturally unifies the whole platform too because it can work across the whole synthesis, place and route, and sign-off. Like I mentioned in my comment, there is a pull-through of synthesis and sign-off along with place and route through Cerebrus. We are seeing that. We are pleased with the progress we are making in synthesis and sign-off along with place and route implementation. It does help in terms of full flow. This drives full flow wins, right? Not just place and route. I think in 2022, we have more than 40 new full flow wins. Okay. That's helping our digital business. You see this quarter, we had good growth in digital just like we had last quarter.\nNow, on the hardware side, I mean, that attach rate is there in the large kind of semi companies, but also there's a lot of hardware being used as system companies design semiconductors. Because by nature, as you know, system companies have more software, right? That's why they are a system company. When you have software, you naturally need these hardware platforms for software bring-up. I think we are very pleased to see the growth of hardware, not just in the traditional large semi, but also in the large system companies. We try to do these new offerings, like I talked about, cloud to help lower barrier to entry for smaller companies, whether they are system or semi for hardware. Overall, I think we are pleased with the progress of both digital and hardware, and we just carefully monitor it going forward.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stifel Nicolaus\n\nThanks for all that detail, Anirudh. I'll leave it there for now. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn it back to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We are excited about our business momentum, and the tremendous market opportunities ahead of us. We are proud of the innovative and inclusive culture we have built at Cadence, and we are grateful for the recognitions we have received over the years, including most recently being named as one of the world's best workplaces for the seventh time by Fortune and Great Place to Work. We are also honored to be included in Investor Business Daily's 100 Best ESG Companies for 2022, the fourth year in a row that we have achieved this recognition.\nOn behalf of our employees and our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for your continued trust and confidence in Cadence. We look forward to speaking with you again on our Q4 2022 earnings call. Thank you, and have a great evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence third quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Anirudh.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Cadence delivered outstanding financial results for Q2, with accelerating, broad-based demand for innovative solutions driving double-digit growth across all our business groups. We beat our guidance on all key metrics and are significantly raising our financial outlook for the year, resulting in 17% year-over-year revenue growth, as well as exceeding the rule of 55. John will provide the details in a moment on both our Q2 results and the updated outlook for the year. Generational trends such as 5G, hyperscale computing, and autonomous vehicles, underpinned by AI/ML and data analytics, are accelerating the digital transformation across multiple industries. Notwithstanding the macroeconomic uncertainties, our customers continue relentlessly investing in their next-generation innovation, with semiconductor companies benefiting from increasing silicon content, and system companies investing in building custom silicon.\nThese exciting trends are fueling robust design activity and driving a strong secular tailwind for end-to-end core EDA, IP, and expanding systems portfolio. In Q2, we significantly accelerated our intelligent system design growth strategy through the introduction of five new innovative products, as well as through the transformative OpenEye Scientific and Future Facilities acquisitions that expand our TAM and position us well for future growth. This morning, we announced our intent to acquire OpenEye Scientific, a leader in computational molecular design space. Over the past few years, we have successfully extended our multi-decade chip-level simulation expertise to the system level, first to finite element analysis and more recently to computational fluid dynamics. With OpenEye, we are now expanding into molecular modeling and simulation, an emerging area of growing interest as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies accelerate their emphasis on software solutions for drug discovery.\nThe acquisition will allow us to leverage our solver and AI/ML leadership, along with large data management infrastructure, to significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of biosimulation. This will drive disruptive innovation in the life science market through increasing the efficiency and success rate of traditionally long and complex drug discovery processes. Additionally, OpenEye's market-leading Cloud-native SaaS platform can capitalize on our Cloud expertise, thereby benefiting highly computationally intensive biosimulations. OpenEye's scientifically proven, innovative solutions are used by 19 of the top 20 pharma companies, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and leading biotech firms. We excitedly look forward to Dr. Anthony Nicholls and the OpenEye team, with their deep science expertise and rich domain knowledge, joining Cadence. During the quarter, we also acquired Future Facilities, a pioneer in the data center digital twin space that expands our CFD portfolio and extends it to data centers.\nIn addition to electronics cooling analysis, Future Facilities' innovative solutions enable customers such as HP Enterprise, Digital Realty, and Equinix to optimize the thermal and power efficiencies in the data center using physics-based 3D digital twins, thereby helping reduce their carbon footprint. We are excited to welcome Hassan Moezzi and his talented team to Cadence. Now, moving on to Q2 product and customer highlights. A key element of our approach has been to partner closely with market-shaping customers and win their confidence by providing leadership platform solutions based on best-in-class engines. In Q2, we deepened our longstanding partnership with Samsung through a wide-ranging expansion of our core EDA, system software, and hardware solutions. We are excited to have extended our collaboration with AMD through a far-reaching commitment to our innovative core EDA, hardware, design IP, and system software solutions. Demand for our core EDA software remained strong and broad-based.\nOur digital business had another strong quarter with 14% year-over-year growth, fueled by key competitive displacement, as well as significant expansions at several market-shaping customers. Adoption of our digital full flow, delivering industry-leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes, continued to accelerate with close to 25 new wins in the first half of the year. Our innovative, automated, and scalable Cadence Cerebrus solution, with its unique self-learning capabilities, allows users to explore the entire design space and intelligently optimize the digital full flow to meet their aggressive PPA schedule and productivity goals. Cadence Cerebrus continues to see accelerating proliferation, especially with market-shaping customers, as they realize transformative results across a broad range of complex production designs and getting as much as 30% reduction in leakage power and up to 30x productivity improvement for design tasks ranging from design technology co-optimization, automated floor plan implementation, and final PPA push.\nAt our recent Cadence Live Silicon Valley User Conference, several key customers, including Intel, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Samsung, and Renesas, presented their remarkable successes using Cadence Cerebrus. Functional verification is becoming a key differentiator as we enable our customers to improve system quality and speed up their time to market. In Q2, our business grew 13% year-over-year, led by strong growth in hardware and Jasper. Strong secular demand for our industry-leading Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 platforms, especially from hyperscale AI/ML and server customers, led to our best Q2 ever for hardware. With 10 new customers and nearly 50 repeat orders, more than two-thirds of the orders during the quarter included both the platforms. Our IP business had a very strong quarter, growing 30% year-over-year as the continuing IP outsourcing trend drove strong design and foundry activity for our star IP, especially at the most advanced nodes.\nOur leading DDR IP solution continues to proliferate strongly, especially at hyperscaler and memory customers, while our PCIe portfolio had significant wins with compute and automotive companies. Tensilica continued to expand its footprint in true wireless, stereo, and Bluetooth headsets, and had notable wins in automotive, mobile, and AR/VR end markets. Our system design and analysis business that is driving expansion beyond EDA continued its strong momentum in Q2, delivering 29% year-over-year growth as we increase our footprint in several verticals, including high-tech electronics, hyperscalers, aerospace and defense, and 5G communication. In Q2, Ciena, a leader in intelligent networking, adopted our advanced node custom design, photonics, multiphysics analysis, and 2.5D/3D packaging solutions for their next-generation coherent optical solutions. Exploring design complexity, coupled with rising product development time and cost, is driving the need for innovative packaging solutions that can handle heterogeneous integration in a modular manner.\nWe are seeing accelerating growth for our Integrity 3D-IC solution, which is the industry's only comprehensive platform with all in-house technology that provides a truly tightly integrated, optimized solution across system-level floor planning, implementation, packaging, and system analysis. Our system analysis portfolio, delivering disruptive performance and capacity benefits without compromising accuracy, is proliferating nicely with both semiconductor and system companies. For example, in addition to multiple repeat orders, Clarity 3D Solver was adopted by leading companies, including a Marquee US Semiconductor company, a market-leading US company providing RF and mobile communication chips, and a global marquee hyperscaler. We also announced a new multi-year partnership with McLaren Racing, who will use our Fidelity CFD software to investigate airflow. We are also very excited to have introduced Optimality Explorer, which brings the revolutionary AI technology implemented in Cadence Cerebrus to the system space for the very first time.\nThis solution enables the delivery of optimized designs about 10x faster on average than traditional manual methods, with up to 100x speedup having been seen on some designs. Optimality is quickly ramping up with early adopter customers as they realize these compelling results, with Microsoft, MediaTek, Baidu, and Umbrella having provided strong endorsements for the product. As we innovate on our systems technologies, we are also enhancing our go-to-market strategy. In Q2, we launch our transformational OnCloud SaaS and e-commerce platform, a scalable solution offering instant access, flexible use models for companies adopting a cloud-first approach. This new e-commerce platform is the industry's first, and offers a consumption-based use model that's built upon the well-established Cadence CloudBurst SaaS platform. Several customers, including Bombardier, Cisco, and Amazon Web Services, have endorsed the significance of this game-changing platform.\nTo summarize, semiconductor and system companies are relentlessly investing to accelerate their innovation, and this continues to drive secular tailwinds for our business. Q2 was an outstanding quarter as we raised the financial outlook for the year while advancing our intelligent system design strategy, setting us up well for future growth by expanding into new end markets with our OpenEye and Future Facilities acquisitions. Now, I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q2 results and our updated 2022 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. Cadence achieved strong results for the second quarter of 2022, driven by broad-based strengths across our technology portfolio. All of our product categories saw double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, and we exceeded all key financial and operational metrics in Q2. Here are some of the financial highlights from the second quarter. Total revenue was $858 million.\nGAAP operating margin was 33%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 42%. GAAP EPS was $0.68, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.08. Operating cash flow was $325 million. We used $350 million of cash to repurchase Cadence shares, and at the end of the quarter, our cash balance totaled $1.03 billion, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Before I provide our updated outlook for fiscal 2022 and what we expect for Q3, I'd like to take a moment to share certain key assumptions embedded in our outlook. We assume the export limitations that exist today will remain in place for the remainder of the year. We have included the expected impact of both the Future Facilities and OpenEye acquisitions.\nAt the midpoint of our fiscal 2022 outlook, we have included the following for these acquisitions: revenue of $15 million, that's one-five, $15 million, and an operating cash outflow of $60 million, largely due to our expectation that some of the price paid for these acquisitions will flow through operating cash in the second half. Embedding these assumptions into our updated outlook for fiscal 2022, we now expect revenue in the range of $3.47 billion to $3.51 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 29.25%-30.25%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 39.25% -40.25%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.59 - $2.65, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.06 - $4.12, operating cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, and we expect to use our free cash flow to repurchase approximately $900 million of Cadence shares in 2022.\nFor Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $860 million to $880 million, GAAP operating margin in the range of 26% - 27%, non-GAAP operating margin of 37% - 38%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.58 - $0.62, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.94 - $0.98, and we expect to use approximately $150 million of cash to repurchase Cadence shares in Q3. Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, 2022 is shaping up to be another strong year for all of our businesses at Cadence. I am pleased that revenue growth and profitability continue to improve. At the midpoint of our annual outlook, we now expect revenue growth of 16.8%, non-GAAP operating margin of 39.75%, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 24.3%.\nAs always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees, and with that, Operator, we'll now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad now. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question is from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and let me extend my congratulations to a strong first half to the fiscal year. I wanted to start out by asking if you could give us some additional detail as to how material multiphysics simulation software is becoming now as a portion of your systems analysis business.\nAlong the same lines, given that you're now moving into areas like aerospace, life sciences, data center infrastructure, and other non-semiconductor end markets, maybe if you can share with us your view on how you need to build out your sales channel or your SaaS model to address these non-traditional customers for Cadence.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Hi, Gary. That's a great question. First of all, we are very pleased with our execution to the intelligent system design strategy. As you see, we are doing well applying computational software expertise to our core and then new areas. All our businesses are doing well.\nAs we expand into the system space, like we did with finite element and then CFD, I also think that it's very important to not just disrupt existing areas of simulation, but also get into new areas of emerging areas of simulation, like we announced today with the molecular simulation. That naturally adds to our customer base and expanding opportunities. Now, in terms of OpenEye, it will operate as a, when it closes later, it will operate as an independent business unit. In general, like we have talked about in the past, we are focused on expanding our go-to-market. If you look at that OnCloud, there's another way to reach the long tail and expanding customer base. Overall, we have structured our go-to-market to be slightly different in this new area.\nThat's only natural because it's not just the direct channel, but also the indirect channel, and now the Cloud and SaaS offerings. Okay.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAppreciate that, Anirudh. If I could just ask some, I guess, maybe said differently, double-click on the backlog metric of $5.6 billion. Any notable changes to the average license duration? Maybe if you can speak to the diversity of the backlog growth.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, sure. Gary, great question. Yeah, of course, there's an element of time in that backlog number. I think if you look at the RPO number, that excludes the $171 million from other arrangements with non-cancelable commitments, it's about $5.4 billion in RPO, of which about 51% of that is backlog that's expected to revenue in the next 12 months. It's your 12-month backlog.\nI think the annual value of that backlog, I mean, your backlog number of $5.4 billion, or your RPO number of $5.4 billion, is a mix of your annual value and time. We're very pleased that we've hit, it's roughly $2.75 billion in one-year backlog now. Very pleased with that. The systems business itself is about 12% of revenue, and probably a similar percent of that one-year backlog.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay. Just to be clear, there wasn't one or two particular customers that drove the increase in the backlog?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nWell, the first half was very strong for us. We had some big renewals in the first half. As you recall, last quarter, we talked about a US Marquee Semiconductor company in which we had a record contract. We had big renewals again in the second quarter.\nI think the thing to focus on when you look at the backlog is certainly the one-year backlog. I think it reflects the quality of the backlog, and then the $5.4 billion reflects the amount of time that we've booked with customers.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you for taking my question. If I go back to the start of the year when you reported Q4, you had suggested a 12% growth rate for the year, and now you're guiding to 17%. I'm curious, what created this big 500-point delta? I don't remember the same kind of pace of upgrades of revenue through the year, especially if the business has such recurring elements. I'm just curious, what is driving this pace of upside surprise?\nI guess part B of this is, what is the sustainable growth rate for Cadence? Is it the 10%, 11%, which is what your exit Q4 revenue implies, or is it now at this new baseline of mid-teens growth or so?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nHi, Vivek. All great questions. I'll take that, if you don't mind. Essentially, at the start of the year, we were guiding to 12% with an expectation that I think we expected 87% or 88% of our revenue to be recurring in nature. It's been a great year, certainly great first half for our functional verification, particularly the hardware business there. IP has done quite well in the first half. We've had a higher mix of upfront revenue in the first half, and that's driven up the percentage to a certain extent. I know you're rounding up to 17%.\nI think if you extract the impact of inorganic revenue that we've included in our outlook for the remainder of the year, if you take the $15 million out, it's up to 16.5% now. That's largely due to growth across all of our business lines. Our business lines are all performing really, really well. There's also a higher mix of upfront revenue this year compared to what we expected at the start of the year and compared to last year.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks, John. I guess then the part B of is this mid-teens growth, whether it is 15% or 16% or 17%, is this the new baseline of growth for Cadence? Has something changed to get you into this higher tier of growth, or is the 11% that you had previously in the three-year CAGR basis still the right way to think about Cadence from a longer-term perspective?\nIf I could just sneak in a quick one to that, what happens if there is a downturn? I know your business model is fairly resilient, but if there is a downturn in semis, which part of your business will see it first?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nOkay, Vivek, a number of questions in there. Let me unpack it a little bit. I think if you're looking at the underlying growth rate in the business, a good way to look at it is to look at the three-year CAGRs, because that reflects how well the business has done over one contract cycle. Typically, our customers sign up to three-year contracts with us. There has been more upfront revenue business this year. If you look at our Q, we disclose that in quite some detail.\nI think if you unpack that, you'll find that the recurring revenue business is probably growing at 12% - 13%. The upfront revenue business this year, our upfront revenue this year compared to last year is up considerably. The recurring revenue is much more sustainable going forward. Let me hand you over to Anirudh to talk about the impact to our business if there's a downturn. I think the recurring revenue is very, very sustainable.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, hi Vivek. That's a great point. As you know, our business is very resilient. I would say that's probably three main reasons. One is we are critical to our customers' R&D, we're essential products for their current and future roadmaps. The second reason is we are a highly ratable business, as you know, as John explained, which gives some higher visibility, and also traditionally, historically strong renewal rates.\nThe third thing I would like to highlight is that we are very diversified, both in terms of geographies and markets. I mean, we are carefully watching the macroeconomic environment, but overall, I feel we are in a good position to weather whatever uncertainty is in front of us. The generational trends are intact, right? We always talk about the three big drivers for our business. One is the semiconductors and the growing need for semiconductors and digitization of all verticals. Second thing is the system companies doing more silicon and our growing relationship with the system companies. The third big mega trend is our own move beyond EDA into TAM expansion to system design and analysis to different kinds of simulation and optimization. That also brings more customers and more diversification.\nOverall, we feel good about where we are, but we are watching the environment very closely.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks very much.\nYour next question is from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Anirudh, let me start with you, referring back to a couple of important points you made in your keynote addresses, both at Cadence Live two months ago and at DAC two weeks ago. You've said two things that are, I think, important. One is that AI-based EDA is, in effect, the next big thing in EDA. The question there is, what are the implications for you in terms of your services model and specifically the kind of AE capacity that you need to provide over time to support that for both your semi and systems customers?\nRelatedly, you said two weeks ago, very interesting point, that EDA needs a framework for optimizing multiple runs in lieu of the single-run history at EDA. The question there is, do you, in fact, have that now, or are you still working on getting to that point? Second question for John, excluding acquisitions, how are you thinking about headcount additions for the balance of the year? You've, interestingly, as compared to other tech companies, maintained a fairly high level of open positions. How are you thinking, again, ex-acquisitions, about your ability to bring on both R&D and AEs for the rest of the year?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Hi, Jay. First of all, thank you for attending the keynotes. That's great. Now, in terms of, like I always say, our strength is in computational software.\nI want to highlight computational software, as you know, is not just simulation. Of course, we have big expertise in simulation, but it's also optimization and design. EDA has a rich history of writing one of the most complicated optimization or design software. I mean, for example, things like place and route and digital implementation are probably the most complex optimization software that's available. What I'm really excited about use of AI is not just in simulation, but more importantly, in optimization. You can see that in Cerebrus. Cerebrus, coupled with our digital flow within of us, can provide dramatic results. I think this combination of inside-out or simulation-based or science-based, physics-based simulation, whether it is in chip design or system level, combined with outside-in AI for optimization, is a huge mega trend. The simulation plus AI, a combination of analysis plus optimization.\nOf course, we applied it to chip design with Cerebrus. Recently, I'm also very excited about Optimality. We have dramatic results because similar technologies can be applied to system simulation. To your point, Cerebrus and Optimality, based on reinforcement learning, require this multi-run kind of optimization, which traditionally EDA hasn't done. We are very pleased with the progress. I mean, there's another area, as you can know, which is like verification that also requires multi-run. We are tying all these things together and applying this kind of multi-run data analytics and AI across our product portfolio. The benefit of that to our customers is, of course, they can do more with our software.\nWhat I expect is that over time, we should be able to get more and more spend of the R&D to automation with things like Cerebrus, Optimality, and overall automation. John, you can comment on this segment.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYes, yeah. Jay, in relation to headcount, I think if you notice the second half where our margins tick down a little bit in comparison to the first half, that's all due to employee costs, really. Our merit cycle kicks in on July 1st, so pay increases impact us in the second half of the year, and we expect to continue hiring at pace in the second half of the year. Chip design activity has been very strong, both with semiconductor and systems companies.\nThe market for talent is very competitive, but with how we've performed on the Great Place to Work surveys for the last six, seven years, I think we've had no issues with attracting talent, and we're not slowing down our hiring activity. Of course, as you mentioned, we're bringing in headcount through M&A as well.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Charles Shi with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you for allowing me to ask a couple of questions. Anirudh and John, I would like to ask how much of your business is kind of exposed to startups?\nThe reason why I want to ask it is that over the last two, three years, the VC funding going into semiconductor startups has been picking up very significantly, and I believe that probably benefited your business in some way over the last few years, might have added to your growth. With now the macroeconomic condition kind of worsening and financial conditions kind of tightening, I think some investors have started to worry about the startup fundings and the potential impact that their EDA spending. I want to ask your thought. Can you first quantify to us how much of your exposure into the startups, especially those are pre-revenue? Secondly, what do you think in terms of your impact to your business over the next 12 months in this part of the segment? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nHi, Charles. Yeah, great question.\nAs I mentioned to Jay a few moments ago, I mean, chip design activity is very strong. I mean, I think within the startup community, we've probably observed more caution in spending, but demand is there right across the board. In terms of quantifying our exposure, our exposure is quite small on the startup side. If you recall back in, I think it was Q2 2020 at the height of the original outbreak of COVID and that pandemic, I think at the peak, we reserved $70 million of bookings for, and they were mainly small customers. At that, we probably collected half of that eventually. I don't think we have any significant exposure on the startup community. Like I say, although they're being cautious, demand is there right across all our businesses.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nAlso, Charles, everything we know is in the guidance. I mean, to the extent that there's been any impact in our pipeline, that's already included in the guidance.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it. Got it. Thank you. Maybe a second question on the 3DIC solutions. Congrats on some of the new attractions, certainly including the adoption by the US Marquee customer. I want to ask a little bit high-level question. I believe it was TSMC who recently kind of introduced something called 3D Blocks. One of the things in their 3D Blocks platform is the interoperability of the 3DIC design tools across different vendors. Anirudh and John, I know you guys have been working on this full-flow solution or under OneRoof for 3DIC. Obviously, it doesn't mean that they are not interoperable with other vendors' tools.\nMy question is whether your foundry customer, what they are trying to do, would that diminish some of your product differentiation there, or what do you see? What does that mean to your 3DIC strategy? Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Hi, Charles. That's a good point. First of all, we are very happy, like you said, with the progress in 3DIC. We are glad to work with all the leading foundries, and we have a strong partnership given our position in the market. Now, I think this is not any different than traditional EDA, though. I mean, typically, the customer always has a choice to put flows together by multiple tools. Even if you look at traditional EDA, because of advanced node and design complexity, an integrated solution gives better results.\nEven our traditional EDA tools can be run as a mixture of other tools if the customer so chooses. We will allow that flexibility in all our domains, but we always believe that a fully integrated solution, like with verification products or digital products, and same thing with 3DIC, gives the best results, the best PPA. That's what we are all about. We want to deliver the best CPA and productivity to our customers and work with the leading foundries to provide that. I don't see any different from other areas, but at the same time, the focus on benefit of the full flow is even more critical.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon and congratulations on the solid results and execution.\nA recent dynamic that your semiconductor companies are focused on and their customers are focused on, given geopolitical, national defense, continuity of supply risk, diversification of manufacturing partners, right? Some of them are currently sourced to a particular foundry but are now putting in place to support one or more partners. This is going to entail new library development, new IP blocks, whether purchased or organically developed, and even inflows. I think this is for both leading-edge digital, analog. I know that the chip companies have to add design engineers every time the new foundry partner. Is this focus on manufacturing diversification of four or five of your EDA and IP businesses as well? I would think so, but wanted to get your views.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a good point.\nAs you know, we are very diversified across all segments and geographies, and also have the great privilege of working with all the leading foundries in the world through the strength of our products. We are more focused on the design side than the manufacturing side because all our products are used on the design side. That having been said, as there is more onshoring or investment by several governments now to improve manufacturing, it does require more tool enablement, EDA enablement, and IP work at all these foundries. I think that drives more demand for our products, and we are glad to work with all these partners as we move forward. At the macro level, we are focused on the design side and our end customers, right, to build their solutions. Any kind of manufacturing-driven uptake and enablement is good for our business. Yep.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nExactly. Okay. On your IP business in compute, I think you mentioned this in some of your remarks, but in compute, you've got Intel and AMD rolling out new processor platforms, right, supporting next-generation memory storage interfaces. We've got DDR5, PCIe Gen 5, CXL for storage. All of these processors are rolling out at the end of this year. Additionally, in networking, we're kind of still early days in the adoption of 100 gig serdes for 200 gig and 400 gig optical. You guys obviously have a strong position here as well, or in all of these segments. With all of these trends inspiring, and customers looking to adopt these next-gen standard interfaces on their chip designs, the IP business continues to stay strong, year-over-year growth from here?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a good point.\nI think our IP business is doing well, just like you saw in our results, even Q2 results. We always focus on star IP, and we have design IP portfolio, like you mentioned, with DDR, PCIe, high-speed SerDes with the Silica platform. Right now, we're seeing strength across all those segments, and we are pleased with that. Like I said, design activity is strong, and IP is a key part of the design activity, so we are happy with the progress. I would say that the strength is broad-based across not only our different product lines, but also different customer segments. This overall trend of IP also, oh, I just wanted to say IP also benefits from the trend of outsourcing as customers focus on their core expertise. As you know, they will outsource IP. Overall, I think it's a good business.\nAlso, our focus on star IP has improved the profitability of our IP business in the last few years, and we are pleased with that trend.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThank you, Anirudh.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThank you, and nice quarter, gentlemen. Just wanted to dig in a little more on the OpenEye acquisition. It looks like this is almost a platform play in the healthcare vertical. Is that the right way to be looking at it? It looks like they have a number of partnerships in a bunch of different areas. I wonder if you can just expand the sort of where you see yourselves going with this product.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a good question. I mean, first of all, like I said, we believe we are best-in-class computational software, right? That includes simulation, design, simulation optimization.\nWhen we go into simulation space, system simulation, we want to do existing areas which are well-established markets like finite element and CFD. We have talked a lot about it over the last few years, but also new areas which are emerging and will be important for the next 10 years. I can't think of a better emerging area than molecular simulation. Now it has multiple applications to materials, plastics, and other things, but one of the exciting applications is, of course, life sciences and biosimulation. The thing I like about it is not only is it simulation and should have all the properties of system simulation like FEA and CFD, it has application to a very important vertical which will have to be more and more digitized over the next 10 years.\nIt has both those properties, the inherent R&D synergy and properties of simulation, but also in a very important vertical. The same thing, by the way, is true for Future Facilities. If you think about it, the reason that like that acquisition in companies, it's in a CFD area, which is, again, system simulation, but in a data center vertical, which is a huge thing for sustainability and power consumption. I don't need to tell you how important Cloud and Data Center is. Both of these acquisitions have inherent strength, which ties to our computational software expertise, but also good and important growing verticals. They have strong positions in those. Talking about OpenEye, they are used by 19 of the top 20 pharma companies, and also a very broad portfolio and leadership in molecular design and simulation, and also a very good go-to-market with SaaS.\nThey are the first company in that space to go to SaaS and Cloud-native applications. It has multiple characteristics that we like, at the same time having a talented team. The same thing is true for Future Facilities. That gives you an idea of we want to go into strong horizontal capabilities in simulation, but also in exciting verticals.\n\nBlair Abernethy\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThat's great, thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to the discussion on current RPO. If I did all my math correctly, it looks like the rate of growth has accelerated from the teens to this quarter was north of 30%.\nJohn, if I look at that $2.7 billion number just against next 12-month revenue estimates, either your visibility on those NTM estimates is extremely high right now, or the NTM estimates are far too low. I guess I'll just put the question to you whether, based on the level of bookings activity year to date, you do feel like your visibility looking ahead is particularly good and whether you might be able to actually say, at this point in time, so early on, that your recurring revenue growth couldn't actually even accelerate as we think about the next 12 months.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah, Joe, great question and great observation. Yeah, we're very, very pleased the fact that the current backlog or the kind of one-year backlog has gone up to about $2.75 billion.\nThat reflects strength across all our businesses, but it also reflects the amount of hardware business we've signed up in the last few quarters. You might see that the second half of the year, we've taken up the second half of the year, I think, $52 million compared to where we thought we'd be this time last quarter. A lot of that has been in the functional verification side because of the amount of hardware business that we've signed up. I think in the Q as well, you'll see some new disclosures for raw materials and finished goods in our inventory. We're building the systems as fast as we can to deliver to customers. The $2.75 billion of current backlog or one-year backlog probably has a bigger proportion of hardware in it this quarter than last quarter.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Great. That's helpful.\nJust on the topic of macro, and I think backlog is the answer, so it doesn't seem like design starts or just how your customers are thinking about the next two to three years, that is changing for the worse at all. Just any details on that next level, like maybe engineering seats at customers, the ACV opportunity per seat. We've been talking on this call a lot about the advanced design solutions, which I think actually gives Cadence more revenue leverage per seat than maybe was true in the past. Is there anything there that might give you pause just in thinking about macro or customer spending? I hate to make the this time is different argument, but is some of the things you're seeing truly different relative to past down cycles?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nJoe, I wouldn't tell you that this time is different at all.\nI think what I would highlight, though, is I would like to distinguish that we're part of the design cycle, not the manufacturing cycle or production cycle. Design continues unabated. I mean, I have seen among the smaller kind of startup companies a bit more caution on spending, but demand is still there across the board. I mean, they may be cautious. There might be slightly longer lead times, yet we're still seeing really strong demand across all lines of business. Again, we're in the design cycle. Typically, what we've seen in the past is people double down on design at times like this.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you for fitting me in.\nI wanted to ask about the new e-commerce or e-store capability that you discussed in the prepared remarks. What products are available in that channel today? Who are you specifically targeting to use this?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, good question. We have a pretty busy quarter, right? We have a lot of exciting innovations this time. One of them is OnCloud. We've been working on it for a while. As you know, we've been doing SaaS and Cloud for a while, for several years now. I think what we see opportunity with OnCloud is combining SaaS with e-commerce. This is especially true for it was built for the long tail of the market so that the reach can be higher of our go-to-market strategy. Now, we're surprised that even some of the big customers want to use it.\nLike you saw, some of the big customers like Cisco, Bombardier, and Amazon Web Services were referenced in our announcement. The goal is to reach the long tail. For that reason, the initial set of products are the systems product, our system analysis tools, and Fidelity, Clarity, Celsius, PCB with OrCAD, and Allegro. That's the initial focus. We'll see how that goes because those products traditionally have a much higher number of customers than traditional EDA products. Therefore, Cloud and a SaaS e-commerce platform is good for these kinds of customers. We rolled it out to certain geographies, and we'll expand that over time. So far, we have a lot of users over there, and we are closely monitoring how it goes. So far, so good.\nJust to remind you, we also have the hardware Cloud for Palladium and Protium. The OnCloud focus is mostly for the system products into the long tail. We are positively surprised by some big customers. Yes. Thank you.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nYeah. It's an interesting development. Maybe just a quick one for John, just to clarify. The nice raise through the second half, when we think about the visibility into the last six months, the hardware and the IP strength that you talked about, is that expected to continue at the same pace as the first half? How should we think about that?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence\n\nYeah. Great question. I would say I would characterize the second half raise as being very much driven by strength across all lines of business. There's been probably more of it for functional verification because of strength in the hardware business.\nOn the IP side, I still maintained low teens growth in the outlook despite the fact that we had a really strong Q2. Part of that was because the boost to Q2 revenue that we saw, I think we landed at like 30% revenue growth year-over-year for IP in Q2. I was expecting mid-teens. About $12 million, $13 million of IP revenue in Q2, I had originally forecast to happen later in the year in Q4. That happened in Q2. I haven't taken the year up for that. I mean, we're seeing strength right across all lines of business. The raise, I would say most of it is hardware, and then the rest is split across all the other lines of business. Maybe IP is the smallest amount of the raise. Oh, and there's $15 million for the M&A, of course.\n\nJason Celino\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nRight. Okay. Yeah, yeah. That's right. Perfect. That's all for me.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to the CEO, Anirudh Devgan.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We are excited about our business momentum and the tremendous market opportunities ahead of us. On behalf of our employees and our board of directors, we thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence. We look forward to speaking with you again on our Q3 2022 earnings call. Thank you, and have a great evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to Anirudh.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered exceptional results for the Q1 of 2022, with broad-based demand for our innovative solutions driving solid double-digit growth across all business groups. In view of the strong start to the year and the continuing momentum of our business, we are raising our financial outlook for the year. John will provide more details on that in a moment. Generational trends such as hyperscale computing, 5G, autonomous driving, and AI/ML are creating an explosion of data that, in turn, is driving the need for next-generation compute, connectivity, storage, and data analytics solutions.\nAlong with accelerating digital transformation of multiple end markets, these trends continue to fuel robust design activity, creating rich market opportunities for our differentiated end-to-end EDA, IP, and system solutions. Now, let's talk about our key highlights for Q1. A key element of our approach has been to closely collaborate with our ecosystem partners and focus on market-shaping customers. We are very excited to have built upon our successful engagement with a marquee US semiconductor company and, in Q1, signed one of the largest contracts in company history to enable the broad proliferation of our EDA, hardware, and system solutions.\nAdditionally, in Q1, we expanded our long-standing partnership with ARM, who is using a comprehensive set of Cadence EDA solutions, and Cadence, who is using ARM's latest IP, to jointly provide implementation reference flows and optimized processor IP to accelerate customer innovation. Rapidly increasing challenges in system verification and software bring-up continued to be a strong pull for our verification business, which delivered 30% year-over-year revenue growth. On the heels of a record year, our hardware business had its biggest quarter by far, with unabating demand for our best-in-class Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 hardware platforms.\nWith 10 new customers and over 50 repeat customers, more than half the orders during the quarter included both the platforms. Demand for hardware was broad-based, with particular strengths seen in hyperscale, 5G communication, and AI/ML segments. Our digital and sign-off business had another strong quarter, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Deployment of our digital full flow, delivering industry-leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes, continued to accelerate with more than 15 new wins in Q1. Our innovative Cadence Cerebrus solution uses unique reinforcement learning ML technologies to explore the entire design space and intelligently optimize the digital full flow in a fully automated manner.\nSeveral market-shaping customers have successfully deployed Cadence Cerebrus and realized remarkable productivity, power, performance, and area benefits, including a marquee Asia Pacific system company that used Cadence Cerebrus to achieve 5x engineering productivity and nearly 10% power gains on a critical advanced node subsystem. A leading Asia Pacific hyperscaler used Cadence Cerebrus with our digital full flow to tape out a chip with nearly 2 billion instances, reducing power by 5% compared to the alternative flow. Our system design and analysis business, which is driving our expansion beyond EDA, continued its strong momentum in Q1, delivering 22% year-over-year revenue growth.\nThere is growing interest in our Integrity 3D-IC solution, the industry's most advanced multi-die platform, with tightly integrated system planning, implementation, and analysis technology. A large US data infrastructure company successfully deployed Integrity to tape out their 2.5D IC, and Lightelligence used Integrity 3D-IC, which also enables the development of their fully integrated optical computer system. In system analysis, we continued executing our strategy of building out our multi-physics platform, offering best-in-class engines, delivering superior results compared to legacy solutions.\nWe are pleased with the new wins and growing repeat orders for our organically developed Clarity and Celsius products, as well as our recently acquired CFD technologies. Over the past year, our CFD solutions have continued to proliferate, especially in the aerospace and defense arena, with market-shaping customers such as Lockheed Martin. In Q1, Juniper Networks renewed their commitment to Cadence technology, including comprehensive access to our systems portfolio across PCB, packaging, and system analysis solutions. Last week, we introduced Fidelity CFD, a comprehensive CFD platform that includes enhanced meshing technologies, as well as a next-generation massively parallel high-order solver that dramatically improves the performance and accuracy of complex CFD applications across multiple vertical end markets.\nFidelity CFD software meshing capabilities have been used by Toyota Motor Europe to be their standard workflow for CFD preprocessing, and the winning America's Cup team New Zealand relies on Fidelity Marine Solver for their Hull Hydrodynamic Modeling. Lastly, in addition to our outstanding business results, I'm also proud of our high-performance, inclusive culture, and thrilled that we have been selected by Fortune and Great Place to Work as one of the 2022 100 best companies to work for for the eighth consecutive year. Now, I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q1 results and our updated 2022 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased with the results we achieved for the Q1 of 2022, driven by broad-based strengths across our technology portfolio, and record demand for our leading hardware products. We continue to execute our intelligent system design strategy, making further significant strides with our innovation roadmap, and most importantly, we continue to delight our customers. Here are some of the financial highlights from the Q1. Total revenue was $902 million. GAAP operating margin was 35%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 44%. GAAP EPS was $0.85, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.17.\nCash balance was $1.135 billion. Operating cash flow was $337 million, and we repurchased $250 million of Cadence shares. Before we provide our updated outlook for fiscal 2022, I'd like to highlight that it contains our usual assumption that the export limitations that exist today remain in place for the remainder of the year. With that in mind, our updated outlook for fiscal 2022 is revenue in the range of $3.395 to 3.435 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 28.5% to 30%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 38.5% to 40%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.51 to 2.59, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.89 to 3.97, and operating cash flow in the range of $1.19 to 1.29 billion.\nWe expect to use at least 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2022. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $825 to 845 million, and GAAP operating margin in the range of 29% to 30%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 39% to 40%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to 0.63. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.95 to 0.99. We expect to repurchase at least $200 million of Cadence shares in Q2. Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.\nIn conclusion, all our businesses had a strong start to the year. I am pleased that revenue growth and profitability continue to accelerate. We are on track to exceed 50% incremental margin for 2022, which contributes to our continued operating margin expansion. Also, with the increase in our outlook at the midpoint, we now expect revenue growth for the year to exceed 14%, driving acceleration in our three-year revenue CAGR to over 13%. As always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question to please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We do please ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Let me extend my congratulations to a strong start to the fiscal year. I wanted to start out by asking about backlog. You had roughly a 16% sequential increase. I was wondering, to what extent has emulation and prototyping hardware tools contributed to that increase, as well as IP? I wanted to as well ask you about the diversity of the backlog increase. Was it largely driven by that marquee customer win that you highlighted in your prepared remarks?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Gary, great question. This is John. Yeah, we're very pleased that backlog is now up to over $5.1 billion. It mainly came from broad-based strength across all of the different business groups. There was a substantial uptick in terms of hardware demand, and you saw some of that come through in the revenue number in the quarter. I think you referred to we had a large record contract with a marquee US semiconductor company that we booked in Q1. This was a big extension and expansion to replace an existing deal that was expected to expire at the end of 2022. That contributed significantly to backlog growth as well.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you. Thank you, John. I wanted to ask you about the disclosure in your SEC filings about the subpoena that you received from the US Commerce Department, or BIS. I was wondering if you can give us any update in what that entity is asking for, and perhaps what it relates to, and your take on what specifically is motivating them to ask you for more information.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Gary, we mentioned previously that this is an administrative subpoena. The focus of the subpoena is information about sales to certain Chinese entities. Our response to the subpoena at this stage is mostly complete, and Cadence is in compliance with all export control regulations. Other than that, I really don't have anything else to say.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay. All right. Well, thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Shi with Needham & Company.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe the first question, I want to follow up quickly on the US marquee semiconductor customer. I wonder, you mentioned about record contract you signed. Is that a reflection of expanded scope of a collaboration with that customer, or, I mean, a longer contract duration with this particular customer, or maybe a combination of both? Can you give us some color on that?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Hi, Charles. Thank you for the question. This is Anirudh. Like you mentioned, key approach, key element of our strategy is to focus on market-shaping customers. I'm very happy with this new arrangement with the marquee US semiconductor company. You may know we have been working with this particular customer for a while, and now we are excited to build upon these successes with this new contract. It's a broad-ranging contract, like we mentioned. It includes our EDA solutions, but it also includes our hardware platforms and our new system solutions. It's a fairly comprehensive arrangement, and we look forward to continuing deployment with this very important customer.\nTo give you an example, I think last time we also mentioned, for example, in EDA, we have a lot of successful engagement on our digital full flow. For example, Cerebrus gave very good results at several key blocks on a recent tape-out and about 5x productivity improvement. At the same time, we also have engagements in analog with Virtuoso Inspector. Of course, verification with the key element with hardware, and then system solutions. Overall, we are happy with the progress, and we look forward to wider deployment as we go forward.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nThanks, Anirudh. Anirudh, maybe a second question. I want to follow up on China. Definitely, I understand you don't have any new news on the subpoena front, but your competitor recently, I mean, maybe not recently, they received the subpoena and they made news with one of the press there. Just not really asking you to provide more legal comments on that, but from a business standpoint, are you seeing any changes in terms of behavior among your Chinese customers who are not really subject to the export control measures but may see what's the new development as a sign of potential escalation between US and China on the semiconductor?\nI just want to point out that your China revenue did see a little bit tick up in the first quarter. Maybe I'm not making a wrong correlation here, but any color on this front would be great.Thank you.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, thank you, Charles. We are pretty pleased with our business in China. I think you may know we had some tough compare in 2021 versus 2022, fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020. That's behind us now. I think we expect China business to be strong and to continue to grow. We're seeing that strength across our product portfolio. John, you want to comment?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I would add that, yeah, I mean, we're seeing customer demand is strong, and it continues to present a growing opportunity for us out in China. One thing that benefited us in China in Q1 was we did pick up some software revenue in custom IC and digital IC from some license compliance transactions. They benefited us in Q1, as well as the strong hardware in the quarter.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nGreat. Hi, everyone. Maybe just going back to the backlog development, when you think about how your involvement with the marquee US semiconductor company has evolved, do you think that is emblematic of kind of how your relationships across your broader customer base are evolving? Maybe at a strategic level, can we just discuss how that scope of involvement is changing? Related to that, you introduced quite a few new products over the past 12 months. You've been talking about some today. Are you starting to see those factor into larger ACVs or deal sizes?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Joe, that's a good point. What I would say is that we are pretty happy with our product portfolio and competitive positioning. We are happy that we always start, we focus on the important customers, focus on benchmarking, focus on adoption, proliferation that leads to booking and revenue. Overall, I think we feel confident of our product portfolio that includes EDA and IP. Then expansion of that product portfolio into system design and analysis, as you see, that also grew pretty well in Q1. The use of AI to further differentiate our solutions, whether they are in EDA or in systems.\nAt this point, I think we feel good where we are. Also, we are, as you know, in a golden era of semiconductors and electronic systems. The market is also growing, and we feel we are in a strong position. Together, it's a good tailwind for our solutions and our company.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I would just add there, Joe, that we're very excited about the growth opportunity that this expansion brings us over the next several years.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nOkay, that's great. Then specifically on your hardware platforms, a quarter ago, you discussed how verification had really good visibility, and this was informing your view on a strong Q1 forecast at that time and also a strong first half, but that you weren't necessarily extrapolating the strength in the first half into the second half. You were maybe going to wait and see a bit more. With the updated forecast you're providing today, can you just give an update on kind of where your thinking and forecasting stands with your verification hardware?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, let me talk about verification first. I think John can comment more about the outlook for the year. I think verification, as you know, is a key differentiator for our customers. I think to really be a state-of-the-art kind of design company or a system semiconductor company, your ability to do good verification is critical. That is what can lead to rapid cadence of your products and also how fast from silicon tape-out to product release. I think the importance of verification becomes critical. The importance of hardware platforms, especially driven by Palladium and Protium, to do not just RTL verification, but also software bring-up is critical.\nTherefore, we are seeing a strong demand across both the semiconductor companies and the system companies, which inherently have software, to our verification products. We had a record quarter following a record year last year. In terms of going forward, I would like John to comment on the rest of the year as well.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Joe, I mean, we're seeing significant demand for all of our hardware products. As we said in our year-end call just a few weeks ago, we weren't comfortable with providing an outlook or extrapolating that demand into the second half of the year until we saw the pipeline kind of closer to the summer. We kind of retained that position for this guide.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nOkay. Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Blair Abernathy with Rosenblatt Securities.\n\nBlair Abernathy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThanks very much. Nice quarter, guys. Just wondering if we could talk a little more about the multiphysics simulation side of things. I just wanted to get an update on how your channel partner programs are developing, whether they're getting traction to the overall business. Just perhaps on the multiphysics simulation, sort of what would you classify or what do you view as areas where you've got some competitive strengths?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a great question. First of all, as you saw, we are growing pretty well in system design and analysis. Also, just to remind you that we take all our revenue ratably, even in this segment, compared to some other companies. Whenever you have a ratable revenue, then the bookings are growing faster than revenues. Overall, we are pretty happy with system design and analysis, especially the system analysis portion that is becoming a bigger portion of Cadence business. Our key strength is our computational software expertise. In EDA over the last 20, 30 years, we have a lot of experience doing very, very large systems efficiently and accurately.\nWe apply that computational software expertise to system analysis so our solutions can be order of magnitude better than what has been these legacy solutions in this space. Okay. We first always focus on key customers, the top customers. The top customers in that space are similar to our traditional top customers. These are the big system and semi companies. Also, our top customers in system analysis because you want to make sure your product is differentiated. I think that's ongoing. You see the strength in Clarity, Celsius, and now with the introduction of Fidelity. Now, beyond that, to your point, I think we also work on channel expansion.\nI think we have mentioned in the past that we are expanding our partner network and also expanding more and more of these solutions to be available on the cloud, which also naturally reaches more and more customers. We always want to first focus on the product, focus on the top customers, and the big customers, and then systematically build out a framework to expand the deployment and go-to-market. Overall, we are pleased with our progress. It is also very synergistic with our overall EDA position and overall intelligent system design strategy.\n\nBlair Abernathy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThat's great. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Pradeep Ramani with UBS Securities.\n\nPradeep Ramani\n\nAnalyst, UBS Securities\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a couple of questions on the marquee customer win that you're talking about. Should we think about that as a competitive displacement from your side, or should we think about it more as a similar scope, or maybe expanded scope, but larger contract values? How do we think about that?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I would profile it as an expansion of the proliferation of our technology with that customer. I think that customer has seen the value in the products that we've provided over the last number of years and is ready to take the next step. I mean, typically, when we're proliferating with a customer like this, it starts with them using our technology in a number of individual designs. Then, based on the success of those designs, they proliferate and expand into other multiple designs. They may also continue to use other technology, but it certainly has us very excited about the growth opportunity that this expansion means for us for the next number of years.\n\nPradeep Ramani\n\nAnalyst, UBS Securities\n\nGreat. As a follow-up, your IP business is sort of accelerating if you look at the last few quarters. Do you still feel good about the low teens type of growth rate for the year, or should we be thinking about something that's much higher than that?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWell, over the last three years or so, I think they've been growing around mid-teens. We put in the outlook low teens. It's in the outlook at 13%. We haven't changed that from the end of last year. You might have noticed that they achieved 17% in Q1. What we find is that when we give them a target for low teens, they focus on the most profitable IP business, and generally overperform. The current outlook just represents 13%. There may be upside to that.\n\nPradeep Ramani\n\nAnalyst, UBS Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director of Software Research, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening, Anirudh and John. Question number one, Anirudh, we've spoken over the last few months of how your semiconductor customers are becoming increasingly like systems customers. Systems customers are becoming more like semi customers. With that in mind, though, in what way are the two halves of the customer base still different? I mean, even though they're becoming more alike, what are the important differences that remain in terms of their process or their mix of product from a company like yours? In any case, given the overall rising tide of your business, given the strength of the end markets, how are you seeing the kinds of services and support requirements that you're having to invest in and expand for your customer base?\nSecond question, going back to the marquee customer, if it's who we all think it is, that company is already by far the largest spender on commercial EDA. They, like many other semi companies, have been materially expanding their R&D budget, inflecting higher substantially over the last number of quarters. The question is, could you foresee that particular customer becoming a more than 5% customer for you, or even perhaps 10%, and thereby increasing your overall customer concentration? Thanks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Hey, Jay. Let me start with your first question. Like you said, system companies are becoming doing more semiconductor design, and semiconductor companies are becoming more system companies. This is great for Cadence and the industry. There are similarities there, but you asked about the differences. Some of the differences, of course, first thing is that's one of the reasons we expanded into system design and analysis. Naturally, to system companies, we are not just engaging with our EDA and IP products, which are silicon-centric. We're also engaging with system design and analysis products, whether it's 3D IC or PCB design or simulation.\nThat's a natural synergy of our strategy, and the natural synergy of what is happening in the customer base. That's one big difference. I think the second big difference is that the system companies, naturally, as you know, have software content. That's why they're a system company. The need for hardware platforms, especially both Palladium and Protium, and software bring-up is always critical, but is even more critical for these system companies that are doing semiconductors. I think I would say these are probably the two big things. The third thing that always helps is a lot of times the system companies are new at or sometimes are engaging in new activities in semiconductors.\nThere is no legacy there. That always helps us because without legacy, with the strength of our portfolio, we typically do well in the market. Now, with respect to your second question, like you said, we are pretty happy with our engagement with the marquee US semiconductor company. There is a lot of opportunities to grow there over the years in multiple aspects: EDA, hardware, and the system solution.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Jay, we have a very diverse customer base, as you know. I mean, we're very, very happy that this opportunity means that this particular customer is likely to spend a higher percentage of their dollars with us over the next few years. It sets us up to grow well in that account over the next few years. We expect to grow well in many, many of our accounts, if not all of our accounts, over the next few years. Yeah, I'm not expecting a 10% customer.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director of Software Research, Griffin Securities\n\nThanks. If I could just ask you something. Yeah.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Another thing, Jay, which you probably know already to highlight is as we do more of these AI-based solutions, Cerebrus, and you'll see more from us going forward, it's an opportunity to provide much more productivity to our customers, whether they're a semiconductor company or system company. What we are hoping is that because, as you know, the labor market is tight and the need for talent is always growing, there is more and more need for automation and higher-level automation. I think there is opportunity for us to do well in a variety of customers, especially moving more towards automation and less towards hiring.\nThey will still hire more people, but there's an opportunity for EDA and IP to be a bigger percentage of wallet as we provide more automation in our solutions.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director of Software Research, Griffin Securities\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. Anirudh, if you look at the growth acceleration over the last few years, has it come from a wider customer base, or is it more revenue per customer? If I kind of carry that question forward for the next three to four years, what do you think is going to be a more important factor in driving the growth? Is it a wider customer base, or is it more revenue per customer?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a good question. What I would say is there are three big trends that are helping us. First trend is, as you know, we are in golden age semiconductors, and it's expected to grow, continue to grow for the next 5 to 10 years. Our core business can do well with the semiconductor companies. I think the second thing is, like was mentioned earlier, the system companies are doing more silicon. That adds new kind of opportunities to engage with system companies. That, I think, is going to continue for the next 5 to 10 years because there are systemic reasons for system companies wanting to do silicon for customization, for differentiation.\nThen the third big trend is we are also expanding our portfolio into system design and analysis, which is a growing tab for us, and also expands as a growing market. It's a profitable area. These three trends, which is one is the core semiconductor business is going to do well, that helps our EDA and IP. Second, system companies are going to do more silicon. Third, our portfolio itself is expanding to system design and analysis. All these three things can be helped with AI and more automation. I don't see that changing in the next 5, 10 years. I think these are fundamental trends for a while that can help us.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nGot it. I know this is probably, it might be apples and oranges, but when I look at semiconductor companies, they are benefiting from raising prices. We see across the board their margins are getting better. Are you benefiting at all from raising prices on a like-to-like basis, or is that not a factor when you look at the stronger growth and the acceleration this year? Is there a level of price inflation that is benefiting you in some ways also?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Vivek, our revenue increase always comes from a combination of volume and pricing increases. You see that happen over time on all of the accounts. I don't know what else to say to you in terms of that. Everything has been we just focus on continuing to provide more and more value to customers, and they continue to provide more and more share of the wallet to us.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nAll right. I guess my question is, is the price increase this year different than what you have had historically?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWe have increased prices this year, similar to prior years.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with WestPark Capital.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, WestPark Capital\n\nHi, thanks. Anirudh, I just want to follow up on sort of the discussion around the core segments. Certainly, off to a fast start in some of the other areas this year. Just wondering, when you look at especially the custom IC design, are you thinking that that's an area of your business that is going to sort of get back to sort of the corporate type of growth rates or maybe underperform a little bit relative to some of these newer areas, whether it's fabrication tools, system design and analysis tools, etc.? Just wondering, I hear you the core business is still growing along with the semiconductor area, but it seems like some of your other businesses are set up to grow at a faster pace.\nAm I thinking about that correctly?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes. I think your question is on the custom analog signal business. If you look back several years, that business has performed very well and continues to grow because as we go to newer nodes, it's not just the digital, but the analog has to go to these advanced nodes. We have a pretty good position in the market there. That has grown, I think, slightly slower than maybe digital verification, but still has done pretty well over the last few years. I expect that to continue. There are a few things that are helping it also, apart from the traditional analog design. I mean, there is more and more RF design. Our recent move into RF with acquisition of AWR is well integrated with Virtuoso.\nWith 3D IC and more and more, there's a lot of activity still at mainstream nodes. I think overall, we are pretty pleased with that business. It still has a very healthy growth rate and continues to be also a fairly profitable business for us.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, WestPark Capital\n\nOkay. Understood. As a quick follow-up, Anirudh, given what's going on, it's great to hear sort of the traction at marquee customers and large deals, etc. Is there an update on how to think about your cloud, the kind of the move to the cloud for some of your products, or whether or not you're seeing some of your customers move to even a hybrid cloud situation, or do you think as we get more of these larger customers, is it still going to be the vast majority of your business is going to be on-prem? I'm just trying to figure out if that's still a big initiative for the company as you look out over the next several years.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOh, absolutely. I mean, cloud is a key initiative. I think we have done this for several years. I think we're probably the first company to really invest heavily in the cloud, both from a customer-managed cloud or a Cadence-managed cloud, and also a variety of business models, right? Primarily, cloud allows more flexibility to our customers in terms of usage and business models. We have done this for several years, and we are open to all kinds of possibilities. It's important to give choices to our customers. In some cases, they use their own cloud platform. In some cases, they use our kind of cloud platform that we work with our partners in a more of a SaaS offering.\nIn some cases, like you said, they use hybrid, especially really big customers. If they have already a good data center internally, they use a hybrid cloud for peak utilization, whereas some of the smaller customers or the newer startups may completely go to the cloud. Okay. I think we'll see how the market evolves, but we are ready with all kinds of solutions and business models and do how the customers use those solutions. I do see that the smaller or the newer companies go more towards full cloud, and more of the traditional companies go towards hybrid cloud. In any case, we are set up to service all these models for our customers.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, WestPark Capital\n\nMakes sense. Okay.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWe also have partnership with multiple cloud providers to provide a best solution to our customer base. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Devin Au with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nDevin Au\n\nAssociate Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHi, John. Hi, Anirudh. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to double-click on verification in China. Did you see any of the strength in these areas was maybe due to customers trying to buy ahead of any price increases or perceived inflation, just given the whole current macro backdrop?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. I mean, there was very strong demand, but we have such strong demand that there's a waiting list right now for our hardware. We're building the hardware as quickly as we can. The hardware that we delivered in China in Q1, many of those orders were pre-Q1. They were from last year. We have many, many more orders that we booked in Q1 that we'll deliver later in the year. We're flat out trying to build those systems as quickly as we can right now. Demand continues to outstrip our ability to supply.\n\nDevin Au\n\nAssociate Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Got it, John. Maybe just one more for you. Nice raise to the operating margin for the full year. When you look at first half margin, if I'm right, it's around 40% to 41% range. The guidance suggests operating margins moving a little bit lower in the second half. Can you remind us on what's mainly driving the mix shift there? Is it mainly due to timing of investments, or maybe hiring that's more back-end loaded?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. I would characterize the second half guide as prudent. There's lots of external factors playing out at the moment, and we're very, very confident in that second half outlook. At the start of the year, we highlighted that we expected a strong start to the year with hardware. We didn't want to extrapolate that into the second half of the year until we saw the pipeline sometime in the summer. We are delivering those hardware systems as quickly as we can. We'll take a look at the second half outlook in the summer when we have better visibility into the pipeline.\n\nDevin Au\n\nAssociate Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Got it. Nope. Thank you. That's super helpful.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSVP and CFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nI'd like to turn the call back over to Cadence for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence with strong business momentum and a thriving semiconductor and systems industry, offering tremendous market opportunity. We are proud of the innovative and inclusive culture we have built at Cadence.

Now we'll turn the call over to Anirudh.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered outstanding financial results for 2021. We exceeded our original growth target, achieving 11% revenue growth, 37% non-GAAP operating margin, and operating cash flow of over $1 billion. Generational trends such as 5G, hyperscale computing, and AI/ML are propelling the digital transformation of multiple end markets and fueling a golden era for semiconductors and electronic systems. With robust design activity providing a strong tailwind, we expect our innovative solutions to continue driving broadband business momentum in 2021 and 2022, accelerating revenue growth and profitability. John will provide more details in a moment. Our intelligent system design strategy triples our total available market, and our compelling portfolio of chip, package, board, and system design solutions, leveraging our computational software expertise, uniquely positions us to capture a wide range of exciting opportunities.\nDuring the year, we significantly expanded our core EDA and IP solutions footprint at market-shaping customers, as new customers accelerated their adoption of our expanding systems portfolio. We deepened our partnerships with leading foundry, IP, and cloud service providers, and launched key strategic initiatives. Earlier today, we announced an exciting strategic partnership with Dassault Systèmes that brings together Cadence Allegro and Dassault's 3DEXPERIENCE platforms to provide virtual twin experiences for optimizing the entire value chain for electromechanical system modeling, design, simulation, and product lifecycle management. Central to our strategy is a relentless commitment to innovation. In 2021, we introduced 13 significant differentiated products across our business groups. That will be key to our future growth. Now let's talk about some of the product highlights for both Q4 and 2021. Our digital sign-off business had another strong year with 10% revenue growth.\nDeployment of our digital full flow, delivering industry-leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes, continued to accelerate as more than 45 additional customers adopted it during the year. In 2021, we strengthened our relationship with OPPO, a leading mobile phone manufacturer in China, with our digital full flow and an expansion of our system design and analysis product. We expanded our relationship with Socionext, who used our digital full flow, delivering the best quality of results to successfully tape out several advanced node automotive and hyperscaler designs. Our transformative Cadence Cerebrus solution incorporates sophisticated ML technologies to explore the entire design space and intelligently optimize the digital full flow in an automated manner. Several leading customers are increasingly deploying Cadence Cerebrus in production design and gaining exceptional power, performance, area, and productivity benefits, including a market-shaping US.\nAn automotive company reduced the power consumption of critical 5-nanometer SoC AI blocks by nearly 10% in just two weeks. Additionally, a premier Asia Pacific system company reduced power of their 4-nanometer design by 10%, with one-tenth the effort of manual optimization, and then applied the Cadence Cerebrus-trained ML model to other designs, further improving their power and productivity. Cadence Cerebrus enabled a marquee US semi conductor company to tape out their next-generation SoC with a 5x productivity improvement on several critical blocks. Rapidly escalating system verification and software bring-up challenges continue to drive heavy demand for our verification full flow solutions, delivering industry-leading verification throughput. Our verification business grew 20% year over year, fueled by a record year for hardware. Our next-generation Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 platforms provide best-in-class solutions to address system verification and software bring-up challenges of complex multi-billion gate design.\nDemand for these platforms that were launched earlier last year has greatly exceeded our expectations, as customers quickly embraced their superior performance, capacity, and debug capabilities. The compelling value offered by the common front-end compiler led to more than half of our customers purchasing both Palladium as well as Protium platforms during the year. Our hardware family added over 30 new customers and over 100 repeat orders during the year, with particular strength seen in hyperscaler, mobile, and networking verticals. Our verification software products, which include the Xelium Logic Simulator and Jasper formal verification platform, continue to proliferate, with Jasper having an exceptional year, adding 40 new customers, with particular strength in compute and hyperscale. Today's complex memory and mixed-signal high-frequency designs underscore the need for high-performance and very accurate circuit simulation. Our Spectre platform has been a long-standing leader in simulation tech solutions for analog and RF designs.\nWith the recent addition of Spectre FX, our next-generation fast-spice simulator for memory and large SoC designs, we provide the industry's most advanced, comprehensive, cross-domain circuit simulation platform. Several leading customers have already deployed Spectre FX on their production designs, such as SK Hynix, which has successfully evaluated and deployed the Spectre FX simulation solution to improve their design methodology and productivity in DRAM verification. Micron adopted Spectre FX simulator as it gave very compelling fast-spice simulation performance for accurate verification of their DRAM and flash design. In 2021, our IP business grew in multiple vertical markets, including mobile, 5G, hyperscaler, and automotive. Our leadership DDR and PCI IP portfolio continued to proliferate at the 5-nanometer and lower process nodes, and our design IP portfolio had several wins at top customers, including a significant expansion at a marquee US semi conductor company.\nOur Tensilica DSP portfolio continued expanding its footprint in audio, imaging, computer vision, and ML applications. During the year, we introduced the Tensilica AI platform, delivering scalable and energy-efficient on-device-to-edge AI processes. Rising system complexity for advanced 5G, automotive, and HPC applications is driving the need for a seamless platform solution across design, simulation, and analysis. Our system design and analysis business that is driving our expansion beyond EDA continued its strong momentum, delivering 18% year-over-year growth. There is rapidly growing demand for sophisticated multi-die integration packaging solutions, and our revolutionary Integrity 3D-IC solution, providing tightly integrated system planning, implementation, and analysis technologies, has been gaining strong customer traction. Our Integrity 3D-IC platform was recognized at TSMC's OIP Ecosystem Forum by winning Partner of the Year Award for joint development of 3D fabric design solutions, as well as winning a Customer Choice Award for 3D-IC design.\nLast year, we furthered our system analysis strategy of building out a disruptive, comprehensive multi-physics platform by expanding into the CFD domain through the acquisitions of NUMECA and Pointwise. The integration has gone well, and we have added nearly 100 new logos, including competitive wins across multiple end markets, notably in aerospace and defense. We expanded our collaboration with Schneider Electric, a leader in digital transformation of energy management and industrial automation, as they standardized on Allegro X platform for PCB design, as well as adopting our Clarity solution for system analysis. In Q4, we significantly strengthened our partnership with Analog Devices, with a wide-ranging expansion of our EDA products, along with deployment of our system design and analysis solutions, which will enable them to develop more complete end-to-end solutions for their customers. Butterfly Network leveraged our Clarity 3D Solver for advanced mobile ultrasound design.\nLastly, usage of our Cadence Cloud portfolio continued to scale, with over 250 customers using our solutions in the cloud. Cadence Cloud-ready products are enabling our customers to realize meaningful scalability, performance, and productivity benefits through the availability of several flexible use models. Now, I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q4 results and our 2022 outlook.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks, Anirudh. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report we exceeded all of our key operating metrics for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. The underlying strength and demand for our essential technology and solutions continues to drive consistent growth across the business.\nA strong finish to 2021, combined with our relentless focus on innovation, customer success, inclusive employee culture, and continued execution, helped Cadence to achieve revenue growth of 11% and a fifth consecutive year of non-GAAP incremental margin of greater than 50%, which contributed to an increase in our operating cash flow to $1.1 billion for the year. Here are some highlights from the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $773 million for the quarter and $2.988 billion for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 36% for the quarter and 37% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.63 for the quarter and $2.50 for the year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.82 for the quarter and $3.29 for the year.\nNext, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, our cash balance was $1.09 billion at year-end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $216 million and $1.10 billion for the full year. DSOs were 40 days, and we repurchased $612 million of Cadence shares during the year. Before I provide commentary for Q1 and fiscal 2022, I'd like to take a moment to share the assumptions embedded in our outlook. Our outlook assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.5%. At the midpoint of our 2022 outlook, we are assuming our annual upfront revenue percentage will increase slightly from 2021-2022. This is primarily due to higher upfront revenue in Q1 resulting from a very strong hardware bookings finish to 2021.\nFinally, our outlook assumes that the export limitations that exist today will remain in place for all of 2022. Embedding these assumptions into our outlook for fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $3.32 billion-$3.38 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of 37.5%-39%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.46-$2.56, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.70 to 3.80, operating cash flow in the range of $1.15billion-1.25 billion, and we expect to use at least 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2022. For Q1 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $850 million-$870 million, non-GAAP operating margin of 40%-41%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.70 to 0.74, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1-$1.04, and we expect to repurchase approximately $250 million of Cadence shares in Q1.\nOur CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items, as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the entire Cadence team for continuously improving our three-year revenue growth CAGR and delivering over 50% incremental margin for five years in a row. As a result of the compounding impact of all their efforts, I am pleased that at the midpoint of our outlook, we expect revenue growth of 12% and over 38% non-GAAP operating margin for 2022. As always, I'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners, and our employees for their continued support. With that, Operator, we'll now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone who wants to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad now.\nPer the company, please limit your questions to one primary question and one follow-up question. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question will come from the line of Joe Vroonk with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Hi, everyone. I wanted to start. In the past, Cadence has alluded to certain product segments maybe having a faster growth opportunity over the course of an upcoming year. I'm curious if maybe you could give an updated rank ordering and, I guess, two questions. One, would maybe the growth skew a bit more towards verification in 2022, given the ongoing new product cycle you've alluded to? Then maybe one beat to this question, is there any region that might contribute outsized growth for Cadence over the coming year?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Joe, this is a great question.\nLet me start, and then John can comment more. I think what I would like to say is that we feel that all business groups, all product areas, and all regions are performing well at this time. We feel pretty good where we are and the design activity we see. We are expecting good growth across our portfolio. I think we feel good where how we are positioned.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Joe, I would add to that that if you look at the CFO commentary on page five, we've outlined the three-year revenue CAGR by product category. I find that the most interesting view for me because it's typically one contract cycle with customers. If you look at how we finished 2021, you have kind of strong double-digit growth across all lines of business, with the exception of customer IC, which is high single-digit growth.\nLooking at the guide that we have for 2022, I'm expecting slight improvements on all of those for 2022 over 2021. The one I've hedged back a little bit with IP, I've got low-teens growth in the guide for IP for 2022. There may be upside to that, but right now, I feel comfortable at low-teens.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. That's great. Then just on the outlook, it may be more of a midterm focus question, but if I leave one Q aside, given the elevated upfront product contribution, it seems like the rates of growth for the remainder of the year are not too far from these three-year CAGRs we're talking about, 11%, 12%.\nAs you kind of think midterm, and we've gotten some midterm frameworks from some of your peers in the space, would you expect Cadence to deviate that much from kind of these 11%, 12%, 13% rates of growth? As you say, you seem to have quite a good degree of visibility. It seems like it may be sustainable, but curious on your thoughts there.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, I can take that, Anirudh. On that, Joe, I think you're right to assume that. We're expecting a very strong Q1. We have a lot of visibility into core EDA. We continue to expect double-digit growth there. I called out IP. IP, we typically aim for low-teens. If you look at the three-year CAGR, we've achieved mid-teens in that, but we typically aim for low-teens because we're looking for the highest level of sustainable, profitable revenue growth there.\nI don't want to give the team the opportunity to walk away from some business if it's not of the profitable nature we want. On system analysis, we've typically driven to kind of high-teens there. Yeah, I kind of expect that. The challenge is probably in terms of visibility, it's on the upfront business. On the functional verification side, on the hardware side, it's tough to have visibility into the second half of the year until we get to the summer.\n\nJoe Vruwink\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Very helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham & Company\n\nOh, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe as we exit 2021, could the management team kind of provide us an update on how much of your revenue is coming from system companies versus semi conductor companies?\nHow does that number stack up with the previous years?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI think what we say is that about 45% of our revenue is coming from system companies versus semi companies. Over the years, that has increased. It used to be 40%, now trending towards 45%. As you know, there is more and more system companies doing silicon, and semi companies are becoming more system companies, and system companies are becoming more semi companies. That is a good trend for us and for the industry. The other thing is our product portfolio is also adding, as you know, more system design and analysis products that makes us work more with the system companies. That's a trend that is positive, and I expect to be extra positive for Cadence for the future.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it. Got it. Maybe the next question is really to John Wall.\nI think your first quarter guidance operating margin is well north of 40%. I know you have this metric that called out 50% flow-through for the flow-through rate. As your operating margin kind of gets to that 40% plus, at one point, your margin expansion, if you don't change that target 50% flow-through, it's going to moderate at some point. I just want to ask any thoughts, updated thinking here. When do you think you want to raise that flow-through rate? Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Charles. Good observation there. Yeah. I mean, we're very pleased with the fact that operating or incremental margins have come through at over 50% for five years running now. It's actually averaged 55% over those five years.\nI'm delighted that the start for this year, I think the incremental margin that we've included or embedded in our outlook on the initial guide is the highest of the record incremental margin for Cadence on our outlook. We're certainly targeting to try and drive that up to 50% and higher again for this year. Naturally, as long as we're driving incremental margins that are higher than the underlying margin, we'll continue to see operating margin expand.\n\nCharles Shi\n\nAnalyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJackson Ader\n\nExecutive Director of Software Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. On the system interconnect and analysis side, the growth rate in that product segment came down pretty steadily and precipitously through the year.\nI'm just curious, what gives you the confidence to kind of go from this fourth quarter growth rate in the low single digit back to that low double digit that might be embedded in the outlook?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nHi, Jackson. This is John. That's one of the easier ones to forecast, given that we're mostly recurring revenue in that segment. Like I say, we've embedded high-teens growth into the guide there. Like I say, most of it's coming from recurring revenue.\n\nJackson Ader\n\nExecutive Director of Software Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Easy enough. I guess on the partnership with Dassault, just curious what the commercial relationship will actually look like. Also, I mean, I guess I would have thought that maybe Cadence was already trying to kind of go from your PCB Allegro business to 3D electromagnetics. How does that work with your own organic solvers that you've developed?\nI'm just curious how this all fits together and what your organic electromagnetics business fits into the puzzle.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, that's a great question. What I would like to say is I'm really excited about this partnership with Dassault because this is like two leaders in their respective spaces coming together to address a problem that I think is becoming more and more important, and that's where the industry is going. As you know, the market is moving towards this mechatronics, a combination of mechanical and electronics with software and data on top, and then silicon driving all these engines. When you come from the mechanical side, whether it's a car, a washing machine, or an airplane, the first electronics you see is the PCB, and then the chip, the package, and the chip.\nWith Allegro, with our position in Allegro, it gives us a great platform. Of course, the chip and the package solutions. With Dassault, they are the leader in 3D mechanical design and with product lifecycle management. This is a natural combination of doing a seamless integration of the data, and also the application that span now all the way from concept to design to manufacturing. It's truly a broad-ranging partnership, and it's a multi-year partnership, and we are in the beginning of it. To your specific question on electromagnetics, that's the one specific application that we have and we are developing. There are a lot of things that Dassault does which are completely orthogonal to what Cadence is and our plans are. Things like 3D mechanical design, things like their leadership in product lifecycle management.\nI think there's a good synergy between the two leaders coming together to address this whole space of mechanical plus electronic systems.\n\nJackson Ader\n\nExecutive Director of Software Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThanks. Good evening. Anirudh, we've seen over the last six to 12 months a quite material increase in semi conductor R&D spending for a number of the large semi conductor companies. We call it the great inflection in R&D when we look at numbers from AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and so forth. To the extent that EDA perhaps as a percentage of semi-R&D has held steady or even increased in recent years, would it be fair to say that a good part of this inflection in R&D has already been reflected in your business, hence your $500 million increase in backlog over the past year?\nThis is what accounts for at least part of your accelerated growth expectation for 2022. Second question, you've had a recurring theme in your technology development for the last number of years of commonality and integrations across the product line. Could you mention perhaps which of the integrations, whether organic or organic in acquisition, might have been the most meaningful for you in terms of incremental business? For example, AWR and Allegro or anything else you might care to mention?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah, Jay, I mean, as you know, I think we are in a, like you said, the R&D spending including semi. The other thing just to point out is all the system companies doing semi design. Okay. That is also adding to this. Also, our portfolio is increasing beyond traditional semi to system design and analysis, like we discussed.\nI think all these factors are contributing to the strength. I don't see any, we see a lot of design activity continuing to be very, very strong across multiple regions, across multiple verticals. We feel pretty good as to where we are and where the market is growing. On the second part of your question in terms of integration, we always believe that we have to provide a complete solution. I mean, our industry has to move beyond point tools that used to have been 5, 10 years ago to more of these comprehensive solutions. We have driven that across all segments, whether it's digital implementation starting from 2015 to verification, now system design and analysis. Also, at the same time, partner with the right leaders as it makes sense, like we did with MATLAB a few years ago and now with Dassault.\nIn terms of return, I think there are a lot of areas which are growing. The whole 3D IC and chiplet-based design, I think that's growing nicely. The whole notion of Integrity and the overall solution, together with analysis and implementation, can provide a good vector. There's a whole hardware platform, Palladium and Protium, with a common compiler, and then integration with the rest of the verification suite. I think this still has a lot of legs to grow, a lot of growth can happen there. The third area I would highlight, it's truly exciting, is Cadence Cerebrus and this integration of AI driving chip design. I think we are still in the early innings, and the results are phenomenal. I think that can provide a lot of growth going forward.\nJust to pick these three top things, Jay, to highlight with 3D IC design being one of them, the whole verification and software bring-up being another one, and then AI-based design and Cerebrus being the third.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nOkay. Clarification on the Dassault relationship. Would it be fair to say that it pertains to both your direct and indirect channels and perhaps both their direct and indirect channels?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes. Jay, this is a wide-ranging arrangement, like you said. We'll start with enterprise and then go to the other parts of the market.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Anirudh. Thanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Pradeep Ramani with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPradeep Ramani\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the strong results. I had a question about the trajectory of margins through the year.\nIt feels like very strong guidance in Q1 despite what you could argue is a very big hardware quarter. Yet the full-year margin guide, the midpoint is roughly 38.25%. Is there something going on with the mix? Maybe it's a big IP back half, or is the guidance just way too conservative? I mean, can you help us sort of understand that trajectory? I have a follow-up.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Sure, Pradeep. This is John. I mean, effectively, what I've got in the first half versus second half is probably 50% revenue first half versus second half. On the expense side, it's probably 49:51 because we typically do our pay increases and our promotion cycle effective July 1. You probably see something similar to last year where margins are probably higher in the first half compared to the second half.\nWe continue to improve efficiency through the year so that we start the next year higher than we started the previous year. On the hardware side, on the upfront piece, I mean, that's certainly benefiting Q1. It's a pipeline business, so it's tough to see into the second half of the year. The second half of the year may be conservative right now. I don't know.\n\nPradeep Ramani\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks. For my follow-up on hardware, can you speak to maybe where you are with respect to penetration? I mean, I get that maybe visibility into the second half is not clear, but just in terms of penetration with respect to the install base and maybe even your growing customer base, where do you think we are as of, call it, Q1?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Let me take that on the hardware business.\nI mean, I think there are two big trends, I would say, that are helping us. One is the market is growing. I mean, I think the need for more and more hardware-based verification and software bring-up is increasing. This is true for multiple verticals because, as we said, more semi companies become system companies, and more system companies become semi companies. Of course, the reason they are system companies is they have a software stack, right? You have to develop the chip and also bring up software. I think one thing is that the overall market is increasing. The second thing, I think our competitive position is improving tremendously on top of that. In the old days, we wouldn't participate that much on the prototyping side, and we were more on the Palladium side.\nNow with the combination of Palladium and Protium and these brand new systems, we feel pretty strongly in terms of how well we are positioned in the market. I think the market is growing, and our position with Palladium and Protium together with the new systems is pretty good. I think that it's difficult to predict in terms of your exact question of how far into it, but it still appears to me that both of these are net positive. The market will continue to expand over the next few years, and we feel pretty good about our market position there.\n\nPradeep Ramani\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, guys. Hope all is well.\nThanks for taking my question, and congrats on a strong finish of the year and strong start to the fiscal year 2022. I wanted to give a little bit of a pushback on your fiscal year 2022 guide. This is a first-class pushback, so don't take it the wrong way. If I look at your next 12-month backlog as disclosed in your 10K, it's up about 18.5%. If you back out the extra week from fiscal year 2022, you just grew 13.3%. Under the assumption that the backlog didn't increase as a result of the hardware sales you're expecting the first quarter, why the conservative view on fiscal year 2022 revenue growth?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nGary, okay, great question. I'm not sure I followed the logic on the backlog growth, but there's nothing unusual about the structure of backlog.\nI think we have about 75% of the guide for next year's guide coming out of backlog. Now, I know our backlog includes RPO plus the IP access arrangements. I'm not sure if you're looking at the RPO piece only or if you're looking at the full backlog number. Essentially, in round numbers, about $2.5 billion of the $3.50 biliion is coming out of backlog. Is that what you're getting at?\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nYeah. I mean, it's helpful, and we can talk more about it offline. On a related note, going way back to the end of 2019, I think it was you and Lipu-Bu Tan sat down for whatever reason you're projecting a recession, and you could be right for the wrong reasons, perhaps. You pulled in some license renewals in that late 2019 timeframe. Now we're about two and a half years past that mark.\nAre we seeing now, or should we expect to see some higher level of renewal activity given that we're kind of at the two and a half year mark?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nOh, yeah. Good question, Gary. I mean, generally, in terms of duration, it was typically within our normal range. We typically have most of our customers predominantly on a three-year baseline contract, and then they'll do add-ons throughout the contract that co-terminate. That generally results in roughly two and a half year kind of average duration. If you look over a contract cycle, I think we're always in and around the two and a half years on a weighted average over kind of a three-year booking timeframe. Yeah. RPO was up. Very, very strong finish to the year. We ended up at the $4.4 billion.\nThe only thing that was unusual, I called out in my prepared remarks because I wanted to make sure that you understood that there was a slightly higher kind of upfront revenue percentage in the guide than in the prior year. Typically, I mean, we say, what, 85% to 90% of our revenue is recurring generally, which means that, what, 10% to 15% is upfront. Last year, it was 88% was recurring, 12% was upfront. In the 3,350, it's actually 87% recurring and 13% upfront. It's 1% higher in upfront revenue, but a lot of that's falling into Q1, and that's why we have a strong Q1.\n\nGary Mobley\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGot it. That's helpful. That's John. Thank you.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nNo worries. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nManaging Director, Global Technology Strategist, Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nYeah, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question.\nCongratulations on the solid results. John, maybe just to follow up on Gary's question and maybe to ask it a little bit differently. If Q1 in the full year plays out as guided today, Q1 will be about 25.6% of full-year guide, which, as I go back in history, would be the highest ever. I know the linearity of some of the hardware stuff is falling in Q1. Is the skew really such that this could be a historic year? I guess as you think about visibility into the back half of the year, especially around some of the hardware sales, when would that start to materialize one way or the other?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nWell, yeah, I definitely think it's going to be a historic year. I mean, you can see from the guide and the CFO commentary that the three-year CAGR continues to accelerate.\nI think with the 12% revenue growth embedded in the guide for 2022, our three-year CAGR is naturally rounding up to 13% when we achieve 12% this year. Now, it's off of the back of a strong Q1. The second half of the year is tougher to predict for hardware. That's why I kind of modeled it out at 50% of our revenue falling in the first half versus second half. If we see the demand continue to flow through into the second half, that will take the guide up. It's tough to see that right now because typically our visibility in hardware and the pipeline is about six months. I mean, that's basically how we constructed the outlook.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nManaging Director, Global Technology Strategist, Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nThat's helpful. As my follow-up, Anirudh, I'm wondering if you could help me better understand the impact of AI in the design process.\nA couple of questions. What percent of the designs out there are utilizing AI? At the end point, what's the intended impact of having more AI functionality embedded in design? Is it higher velocity, higher variety? Is it bringing down the entry cost for new customers? What would be the longer-term impact you see on the design business and the growth rate there?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. That's a good question. You already have several key observations there in the question. I think AI, we are still in the early inning, but the demand for Cadence, Cerebrus, and AI solutions is phenomenal. Actually, at this point, we are engaged with almost all of our major customers. I think if we look forward 12 to 24 months, it will not be a question of who's using AI-driven designs. It's like who's not using.\nI think most of our top customers are moving towards that, and we are seeing phenomenal results. I mean, some of the numbers we mentioned, like 10% power saving, 20% timing, I mean, these are numbers that you typically get when you move from one process node to another process node. We are able to get these kind of improvements purely on the results of better algorithms, AI, and mathematics. I think the value proposition is very well understood and recognized by all our customers. The engagement is there across all regions, and across all verticals. I think it's just like to give an analogy to driving a car. Once you get used to more automated cars, people are not going back to driving cars the old way.\nI think the new way will be AI and Cerebrus being the primary driver of how people will design chips. The benefits are significant, and mostly in productivity. The customers can do more things with the same number of engineers in PPA and also geographically. Sometimes they have different skill levels in different geographies, and all that can be kind of made better with these Cerebrus kind of solutions. I'm very optimistic. I think the demand is through the roof, and the solutions are providing real, meaningful results. Actually, I expect almost all customers will move towards this as the way to run our digital full flow. The other thing I would like to add is that even though we started Cerebrus with digital, the similar technologies can be applied to other parts of the design flow.\nOverall, I think this can provide a pretty big benefit to the industry.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nManaging Director, Global Technology Strategist, Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nAnirudh, not at the risk of getting you too far over your skis, against a three-year CAGR that's been accelerating, does the addition of AI allow you to maintain the gains you've made, or does it actually open the promise of even a faster growth rate ahead?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nI think the promise is there. We just have to see how much of the design process is taken over by AI. I mean, the other thing is that the other good thing with Cerebrus is that when we run these things, when a human is running it, they run one experiment at a time, typically. When Cerebrus is done mathematically, we typically run 10, 20 machines in parallel, and each of them may have 16 CPUs or 32.\nWe're running hundreds of CPUs or thousands of CPUs and multiple design iterations in parallel. It's not like driving one car automatically. It's like driving 10 cars automatically in parallel and finding what is the best way to get from point A to point B. That naturally consumes more licenses, and I think it's good value that our customers are getting. Now, in terms of the CAGRs and all, we just have to see. I mean, I think it's promising. We just have to see, and we don't want to project too much till we actually see what it's doing to the license counts and utilization and what percentage of design teams are moving to a purely AI-driven flow. I think we will update you more over the next 12 to 24 months. The promise is there, but we have to see the update. Yeah.\n\nJohn Pitzer\n\nManaging Director, Global Technology Strategist, Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nPerfect. Thanks, guys.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Gail Moon with Barenberg. Please proceed with your question.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just let me piggyback on the Cerebrus stuff. Obviously, like you said, it's early innings. Just to try to understand how you capitalize on it in terms of contract sizes, does it increase your contract size and negotiations? Basically, for the pricing, or do you actually include it as a new SKU that goes in and it's a direct uplift to existing contracts, or it helps in the contract renewals? When do you usually engage customers on it?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. Cerebrus is a new product. Of course, we have to make sure that the base products are good and best in class, right?\nThe Innovus platform and Genes Innovus, the whole digital flow. Cerebrus is an additional capability and product that we provide to our customers, so it's an add-on sale on top of that. I think it's important to make sure not just the AI part is good, but the base tool is also good. Typically, the customers, when they will run Cerebrus, they run multiple copies, like I mentioned, of Innovus or digital full.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nYeah. That's my question. Would it increase the usage of the core products, actually, because there could be more? Because in the past, you were limited by the number of engineers that the companies had. If it expands that, does it widen the bottleneck, and potentially, they need more of the basic products as well? That's what I was thinking, kind of does it get lumped together?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYes, absolutely.\nThat's a great observation. Because when you run Cerebrus mathematically, it is running like 10 or 20 experiments in parallel. When you're running it manually, you're running one or two experiments. Naturally, it is increasing the use of the base product, like you mentioned.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nAwesome. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, obviously, we've been talking and seeing the systems segment growing, outgrowing the other segments, and continue to post a great performance there. If you think about the verticals there, you made a little comment around the auto and the hyperscalers. What is the growth you're seeing on the auto, for example, in that area? Maybe if you can give us an idea of how important auto is for you today versus other verticals.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. That's a good question. In general, auto has multiple aspects to it, right?\nThere's the semi conductor design of it. I think Cadence, historically, because we have both, we have analog, mixed signal, and digital verification, we have traditionally done well with the auto companies, the semi conductor ecosystem of the auto company, okay? We always had the broadest portfolio, and auto chips are naturally mixed signal. Now, I think as we have more of these new products like CFD or system analysis, auto is a very important segment for that too, which is beyond just the semi conductor component. This is actual physical car and the electromagnetics and the dynamics of that. Last quarter, we talked about, for example, Tesla being one of our key customers. I think auto, for overall system analysis market, is a very important market.\nI mean, I think the three big markets there are auto, then aero and defense, and then high-tech electronics, which includes, of course, the semi conductor and the hyperscalers. I think all these three markets are important. As we expand our system portfolio, we want to make sure we do well in all three of them. For example, Pointwise acquisition we made is particularly strong in aero and defense. I think to answer your question, we have been traditionally strong in the semi part of the auto. Now, with these expanded products, we have opportunity to engage on the overall auto, including the mechanical and the system design. Also, this partnership with Dassault amplifies that connection beyond semi to more system and software connection.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGotcha. That's very helpful. Thank you so much for that information.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. Now, Anirudh, I'm curious if this increase that a lot of the foundries are putting at the leading edge, is it pricing some EDA customers perhaps out of the market, or maybe making some customers stay at the N-1 node or be more judicious about the use of the most leading edge because given the expense of going to it? Just what is the correlation, if any, between the cost inflation, right, from the foundry side and the customer's willingness to engage with designs at the leading edge?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. I think the way I would say is that I think we always want to make sure we address the whole range of process technology. We always are working at the most advanced node.\nI think that's going very well. There is more and more investment and demand for that. We are working at three nanometers, and most of the R&D is a two nanometers. We always work more than more, right, with traditional legacy nodes. Now with RF and 3D IC. In 3D IC and chiplet-based design, one of the key things is that, as you know, the customers can mix process nodes. Not everything has to be at three nanometers. Maybe some chips are at three nanometers, some are at seven nanometers. I think the key thing from Cadence's standpoint is to have a very broad solution that addresses the chiplet and 3D IC part, the most advanced digital part, and the mainstream legacy nodes.\nAs the customers make different choices, which is best for their end markets and economics, we are in a position to support them fully. What I would like to say is that, I mean, there is more and more divergence of how the customers put the systems together with advanced node and legacy nodes and chiplet. I think we are in the best position to provide the solutions for the entire set. The customers choose how they want to use it, and we'll be there to support them in whatever choices they make in terms of process node, foundries, and design methodology.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nVery helpful. Maybe a follow-up, if I may, for John, kind of two related questions. John, the earnings growth you're guiding to this year is 14%, but free cash flow growth is very modest, only 4%.\nI guess CapEx is doubling, but very modest free cash flow growth. Kind of related to that, if you're essentially spending on half of the buyback allocation in Q1, does it mean buyback activity is kind of modest on the rest of the year? No. Can you hear me?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nCFO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nYeah. On the buyback side, our first priority for cash is investment in organic R&D, and then to a lesser extent, it's kind of smaller token M&A that gives us an opportunity to accelerate our roadmap. After that, we look at repurchasing shares, and we look to use our free cash flow. Traditionally, we've been using over 50% or around 50% of free cash flow to repurchase shares every year. I expect that we'll do at least 50% this year.\nAs I said in the prepared remarks, we're planning to repurchase $250 million worth of shares in Q1, and that's a lot more than 50%. That's just we're taking the opportunity to repurchase shares at the prices that we see today. In relation to your observation on free cash flow, I mean, some of that's the timing of cash. We received a lot of cash in the last week of last year. Also, in 2022, we're picking up some additional or extra cash taxes. There was a, as a result of, there was a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that went into effect on January 1st 2022, that required companies to capitalize and amortize R&D costs rather than expense those costs as incurred.\nThat creates a bit of an extra cash or tax burden for us in 2022, and we've embedded that into the guidance.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I would now like to turn the call back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nPresident and CEO, Cadence Design Systems\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence as we enter 2022 with strong business momentum, and a thriving semi conductor and system industry offering tremendous market opportunity. Our intelligent system design strategy, redundant execution, and customer-first mindset is driving accelerating growth as we continue expanding our portfolio with new, innovative solutions. We are proud of the innovative and inclusive culture we have built at Cadence, and are grateful for the recognition we have received over the years.\nOn behalf of our employees and our board of directors, we thank our customers and partners for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence. Thank you.\n\nOperator",
